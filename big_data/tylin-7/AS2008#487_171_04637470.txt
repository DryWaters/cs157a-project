The classical model of association rules mining is support-confidence, the interestingness measure of which is the confidence measure. The classical interestingness measure in association rules have existed some disadvantage. In this paper, some problem of interestingness measure on the classical associati on rules model have been analyzed, and then a new interestingness measure for mining association rules is proposed based on sufficiency measure of uncertain reasoning to improve the classical method of mining association rules. The property of the new interestingness measures is analyzed, which validity has been tested in this paper  1. Introduction   Data Mining has been applied to broad range of activities that attempt to discover new implicit patterns and rules from existing information, and obtain interesting and useful knowledge. However, no each pattern and rule has significance. In order to determine whether a rule or pattern is interesting, it need a suitable metric to measure the degree of rule or pattern that customer is interested in. According to the quantified value, the uninteresting rules are crossed out. Therefore, the research on interestingness measure of rule is very importance of data mining  Association rules are one of well-studied problems in data mining. The problem of finding association rule X 000 Y was first introduced in 1993 by Agrawal et al  In the classical framework, technical model of association rules mining is Support-confidence    which is described as follows Assume that I= {i 1 i 2 i m  is the binary set ,where i j j=1,2,…m ers to as item T denotes as transaction, which is the set of items and T 002 I Suppose that X is the itemsets of I and X 002 T  A association rule is the implication pattern as X 001\027 Y  where X 002 I  Y 002 I and X 001 Y 000 The support of rule X 000 Y in transaction database D is the proportion of the number of transaction including X and Y in transaction database D which denotes as support X 000 Y amely Support\(X 000 Y\ =| {T|X 001 Y 002 T, T 003 D}|/|D  Confidence of rule X 000 Y refers as the proportion of the number of transactions which include X and Y in transaction which include Y denotes as confidence  X 000 Y amely Conf \(X 004 Y\ =| {T|X 005 Y 002 T 002 T 002 D}|/| {T|X 002 T 002 T 003 D Given a transaction database D mining association rules means that produce the rule which support and confidence is less than the minim support and minimum confidenc e that costumers give The classical model mentioned above is named as  support-confidence framework which conf\(X 000 Y  measures interestingness of the rule X 000 Y In fact, this classical interestingness measure has much deficiency Several author [1, 2, 5 c r iticized th e u s e o f  supportconfidence framework. In this paper, some deficiency of interestingness measure on the support-confidence  framework have been analyzed, and then a new interestingness measure for mining association rules is proposed based on sufficiency measure of uncertain reasoning to improve the classical method of mining association rules. The property of the new interestingness measure is analyzed. Its validity .has been analyzed in this paper  This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 some shortages in support-confidence framework are analyzed. A new interestingness measure is proposed in Section 3. In section 4, the property of new interestingness measure is analyzed. In Section 5 validity of new interestingness measure has been tested in some example. Conclusion is given in Section 6

2. Some shortages in support-confidence  framework  In the data mining of association rulers in supportconfidence framework Conf \(X Y is used to measure the interestingness of ruler X  Y However, sometime this model retrieves the uncorrelated rulers and misleads to define interesting rule. Thus, there are some limitations on support-confidence framework The following examples illustrate some shortages in support-confidence framework Example 1 6 T h ere is a si m p le tran sactio n tab l e in  the following. The rows denote as the transaction item and the columns stand for the transaction. The total number of transaction is eight X 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 Y 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 Z 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Clearly, from this table it can be observed that X and Y are positively correlated and that X and Z are negatively correlated. However, if we calculate the support and confidence of the rules X Y 25%, 50 and X Z 37.5%, 75%\ it turns out that the second rule dominates the first both in terms of support and confidence This example demonstrates that high confidence should not be confused with high correlation and one should be very careful in defining the interestingness of rules in terms of supportconfidence framework Example 2 7 S u ppos e w e  hav e  m a rk e t bas k et dat a  from a grocery store, consisting of n baskets. Let us focus on the purchase of tea and coffee. In the following table, rows t and  t correspond to baskets that do and do not, respectively, contain tea, and similarly columns c and  c correspond to coffee. The numbers represent percentage of baskets c  c  Total t 20  5 25  t  70 75 75 Total 90 10 100 Let us apply the support-confidence framework to the potential association rule t   c The support for this rule is 20%, which is fairly high in practical case The confidence is defined to be the conditional probability that a customer buys coffee, given that she buys tea, i.e P[t   P  t    20/25  0.8 or 80  which too is pretty high. At this point, we may conclude that the rule t  c is a valid rule However, consider now the fact that the a priori probability that a customer buys coffee is 90 In other words, a customer who is known to buy tea is less likely to buy coffee \(by 10 an a customer about whom we have no information. Of course, it may still be interesting to know that such a large number of people who buy tea also buy coffee, but stating that rule by itself is at best incomplete information and at worst misleading. The truth here is that there is a negative correlation between buying tea and buying coffee; at least that information should be provided along with the association rule t c One way of measuring correlation is to compute P[t    P  t     P[c   0 2  0 25 x 0.9  0.89 The fact that this quantity is significantly less than 1 indicates negative correlation, since the numerator is the actual likelihood of seeing a customer purchase both tea and coffee, and the denominator is what the likelihood would have been in the case when the two purchases are completely independent In the above example, there are exist shortages in the model of support-confidence Thus, it needs to improve the model of support-confidence In the rest of this paper, we will propose a new model to measure the confidence based on sufficiency measure of uncertain reasoning. The new measure not only captures correlation but can also detect negative implication Furthermore, we also study some properties of the new measure and point out its validity  3. A new interestingness measure of association rules  3.1 Some related conceptions on association rules   In order to represent the new interestingness measure, the following conceptions are given Definition 1  P\(X refers to as probability of occurrence of itemsets X in transaction database D  P X denotes as probability of incurrence of itemsets X  in the transaction database D and P\(~X\=1-P\(X  P\(X  Y denotes as probability of occurrence of itemsets X and Y in the mean time. If P\(X  Y P\(X\\(Y then itemsets X and Y is independent in the transaction. Suppose P\(X  Y P\(X\P\(Y then itemsets X and Y is interdependent. From this, the same definition extends to X, Y, Z If P\(X  Y  Z P\(X\P\(Y\P\(Z then X, Y, Z is independence. If P\(X  Y  Z P\(X\P\(Y\P\(Z then X, Y, Z is interdependent Definition 2 Consider ruler X Y If P\(X  Y P\(X\\(Y then itemsets X and Y is independent. If P\(X  Y\> P\(X\P\(Y then itemsets X and Y is positive correlation. If P\(X  Y P\(X\P\(Y then itemsets X  and Y is negative correlation

3.2. Sufficiency measure on rule and its attribute  R.O. Duda and P.E. Hart [8 prop os ed S u bj ect i v e Bayes Method based on Bayes theory in 1976, and build corresponding uncertain inference model. In his model, a conception to quantify the sufficiency of rule X Y named as sufficiency measure have been proposed, which is as follow Definition 3 Consider ruler X Y the formula          Y X P Y X P LS   is the sufficiency measure of ruler X Y which be denoted as LS  The sufficiency measure quantifies the correlation of antecedent and consequent of rule X Y In the following, we deduce two theorems on sufficiency measure and give their proof Theorem 1 The antecedent X and consequent Y of rule X Y is independent if and only if LS=1  X and Y  is positive correlation if and only if LS>1  X and Y is negative correlation if and only if LS<1  Proof LS=1  P\(X/Y\/P\(X/~Y\ =1   P\(X  Y\/P\(Y\P\(X  Y\P \(~Y  P\(X  Y\/P\(Y\=\(P\(X\P\(X  Y\\\(1P\(Y  P\(X  Y\\(1-P\(Y\=\(P\(X\-P\(X  Y\\\(Y  P\(X  Y\=P\(X\\(Y  X and Y is independent  The other two results can be proved in the same procedure   Theorem 2 The value range of LS is 0   Proof:  Because 0 P X/Y 1 0 P\(X/~Y 1 P X P X/Y P\(X/~Y  Thus 0 P\(X 1 and        Y X P Y X P LS   So, the value range of LS is 0    Theorem 1 tell us how to determined whether a rule X Y is correlating form its sufficiency measure and know the correlation degree of the antecedent X and consequent Y of rule X Y   3.3. New interestingness measure of Associate Rules   From Theorem 2, the value LS cannot quantify the correlation of rule X Y because the interval 0, 1  represents the degree of negative correlation while the interval 1 tands for the degree of positive correlation. Thus, the two intervals are asymmetric. For better depict the correlation of a rule, a new interestingness measure is introduced as follow Definition 4 Define P\(X/Y\ - P\(X/~Y as the new confidence of ruler X Y and name it as NConf\(X Y  According to above definition and Theorem 1, it is derived that LS=1   NConf\(X Y\=0 LS>1   NConf\(X Y\>0 LS<1   NConf\(X Y 0; So the following theorem is obtained Theorem 3 The range of NConf\(X Y is 1 1   If NConf\(X Y\ =0  X and Y is independent. If NConf\(X Y\<0  X and Y is negative correlation, If NConf\(X Y\>0  X and Y is positive correlation From the theory above, the classical supportconfidence framework can be revised as follows Suppose I is item Set of transaction database D and X Y  I X  Y  P\(X  0  minsupp and minconf is the minimum support and minimum confidence of ruler X Y which is positive. So, the following results are given 1 p\(X  Y minsupp  NConf\(X Y  minconf  then X Y is interesting positive ruler 2\ p\(~X  Y minsupp NConf\(X Y minconf then X Y is interesting negative ruler Where NConf\(X X/~Y  4. The properties of the new interestingness measure  Piatetsky-Shapir a s  prop os ed t h ree k e y properties that a good measure M should satisfy Consider the interestingness of rule X Y to be evaluated by the interestingness measure M the three key properties is followings  P1  M=0 if X and Y are statistically independent  P2  M monotonically increase with P\(X  Y when P\(X and P\(Y remain the same  P3  M monotonically decreases with P\(X or P\(Y  when the rest of the parameters P\(X  Y and P\(Y or P\(X main unchanged We can easily test whether the new interestingness measure NConf\(X Y satisfies the key three properties. From Definition 4, it suppose that M\(X Y P\(X/Y\ P\(X/~Y Based on Theorem 3 M=0 if X and Y are statistically independent, so the property P1 is satisfied. Because P\(X/Y\ - P\(X/~Y     PX Y PX Y PY P Y    we can easily see that properties P2 and P3 are satisfied for the new interestingness measure. There are other properties o r t h e n e w i n t e res t i n g n e s s  measure to satisfy as follows Property 4 Asymmetric measures B y th e  definition 4 it can be derived that NConf\(X Y   NConf\(Y X Thus, the new interestingness measure is asymmetric measures, namely, the new measure is used for implication rules where there is a need to

distinguish between the strength of the rule X Y from  Y X  Property 5 Row/Column Scaling Invarian  Assume that a contingency tables P=[f 11 f 12 f 21 f 22  is a 2  2 square matrix; Let R=C=[k 1 0;0 k 2  be a 2  2 square matrix, where k 1 and k 2 are positive constants. It can be derived that NConf\(RM\=NConf\(M and  NConf\(MC\=NConf\(M So it can be deem that NConf is Row/Column Scaling Invariance according to the literature [10    5. The test of the new interestingness measure  5.1. Test of example   At first, we compute the interestingness measure of example 1 and example 2 with the new method to test its validity. For example 1  NConf\(X Y\=1/3 while NConf\(X Z 6/7. So, rule X Y is positive correlative, and rule X Z is negative correlative Therefore, the value computed with new method is consistent with actual case. For example 2  NConf\(buy cola buy cheese\= -0.108 The resulting value is negative, which represents that the occurrence of Buy cola is negative impact on occurrence of Buy cheese  which is different from the result obtained by supportconfidence framework, but is better appropriate with practical data. Except for the support–confidence  framework, there some other metric to measure interestingness of association rules, such as Conviction Lift, Leverage, Coverage, Correlation and Odd Ratio which can be referred to the literature [6, 11, 12  T h is section compares all the measures including the new interestingness measure proposed in the section 3. We have chosen a data set on which we have performed the A-priori algorithm [4 f i n d o u t th e f r eq u e n t ite m  set All the measure is applied on each of the frequent item set The sample data \(see Table 1\for the analysis purpose is taken from a store database of customer transactions there are six different types of items and a total of ten transactions. In each transaction a 1 represents the presence of an item while a 0 represents the absence of an item from the market basket Table 1: Sample Transactions TID Items  A B C D E F 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 2 1 0 1 1 0 1 3 1 0 1 1 0 1 4 0 1 1 1 0 0 5 0 1 0 1 1 0 6 1 0 0 0 1 1 7 1 0 1 0 1 1 8 0 0 1 0 0 0 9 0 1 1 1 0 0 10 1 1 0 1 1 0 Total 6 5 6 7 4 5 P\(X\ 0.6 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.4 0.5 The frequent item set generated by the sample data using A-priori algorithm 4 is shown in the following table 2 Table 2: Frequent Itemsets Itemsets Support A,D 40  A,F 50  B,D 50 C,D} 40 All measures are calculated for each rule in table 2 which is output of the A-priori algorithm. The results are shown in table 3  Table 3: Calculation of Different Measures on Sample Datasets Rules  Suppor t  Confidence  Convictio n  Lif t  Leverage  Coverage  Correlatio n  Odds Ratio NCon f A  D 0.40 0.67 0.50 0.95 0.02 0.57 0.09 0.67 0.095 A  D 0.40 0.57 0.83 0.95 0.02 0.67 0.09 0.67 0.083 A  F 0.50 0.83 1.00 1.67 0.20 1.00 0.82  0.800 F  A 0.50 1.00 0.80 1.67 0.20 0.83 0.82  0.833 B  D 0.50 1.00 0.60 1.43 0.15 0.71 0.65  0.714 D  B 0.50 0.71 1.00 1.43 0.15 1.00 0.65  0.600 C  D 0.40 0.67 0.50 0.95 0.02 0.57 0.09 1 0.095 D  C 0.40 0.57 0.67 0.95 0.02 0.67 0.09 1 0.083  From the table 3, it can be seen that Nconf is equivalence to the some measure, such as Leverage Correlation, which have taken consideration of the negative correlation. For example, see the rules A D A D, C D, D C The rules are negative correlation which can see intuitively from sample table. Moreover if the rules are positive, the evaluating result with NConf is accord with the other metric of measure which can be shown by the rules A  F, F  A, B  D and D  B

 6. Conclusion  The works of this paper propose a new model to measure the confidence of association rules based on sufficiency measure of uncertain reasoning, which overcome some shortages of the metric of the classical model support-confidence framework. The new measure not only captures correlation but can also detect negative implication. We have study some properties of the new measure and test its validity Furthermore, the new measure can be used to mine the negative rules. The study of how to mine the negative rules with the new interestingness measure is the future works References  j i a n w ei K M  Dat a m i n i ng co n cep t s and t echn i q u e s  Morgan Kaufmann Academic, San Fransisco, NewYork 2001  2 A  silbe r sc ha tz A  T   W ha t Ma k e s pa tte rn inte re sting i n  kownledge discovery systems IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering 1996, 8\(6\, pp: 970 974 3 R.a g ra w a l T  I m ie linsk i A S. “Mining Association Rules between Sets of Items in Large Databases Proceedings of the 1993 ACM SIGMOD International conference on Management of Data Washington DC \(USA\, 1993, pp: 207 216  4 R A g ra wal R S. “Fast A l g o rith m s  f o r Min i n g  Association Rules Proc. 20th Int.

Figure 1 Experiment Design used in our experiments in order to maintain the high stability as suggested by The topics ha v e title description and narrative However only the titles are used as queries because in real world users only use short phrases to express their information needs 4.1 Information Gathering System An information gathering system IGS is implemented for common use by all the experimental models The IGS is an implementation of a model developed by which uses user pro\002les for information gathering The s model is chosen because not only it is veri\002ed better than the Rocchio and Dempster-Shafer models but also it is extensible in using support values of training documents The input support values associated with documents would affect the IGS's performance sensitively The technical details and the related justi\002cations can be referred to The IGS 002rst uses the training set to evaluate weights for a set of selected terms T  After text pre-processing of stopword removal and word stemming a positive document d becomes a pattern that consists of a set of term frequency pairs  d  f  t 1  f 1    t 2  f 2        t k  f k  g  where f i is t i s term frequency in d  The semantic space referred by  d is represented by its normal form 014  d   which satis\002es 014  d   f  t 1  w 1    t 2  w 2        t k  w k  g  where w i  i  1      k  are the weight distribution of terms and w i  f i P k j 1 f j  A probability function on T can be derived based on the normal forms of positive documents and their supports for all t 2 T  pr 014  t   X d 2 D    t;w  2 014  d  support  d  002 w 12 The testing documents can be indexed by weight  d   which is calculated using the probability function pr 014  weight  d   X t 2 T pr 014  t  002 034  t d  13 where 034  t d   1 if t 2 d  otherwise 034  t d   0  4.2 TREC Model The TREC model is the implementation of a user's mental model For a given topic the TREC linguists read a set of documents and marked each document positive or negative against the topic If a document d is marked positive it becomes a positive document in the TREC training set and support  d   1 j D  j  otherwise it becomes a negative document and support  d   0  Since the linguists who marked the documents are also the people who generated the topics following the assumption that only users know their interests and preferences perfectly the TREC model makes a golden model to our proposed model to mark The modelling of a user's mental model can be proven successful if the ONTO model can achieve the same or close performance to this golden model 4.3 ONTO Model This model is the implementation of our proposed model As illustrated in Fig 1 and required by the IGS the input to this model is a topic and the output is a training set consisting of positive documents  D   and negative documents  D 000  Each document is associated with a support  d  value indicating its support level to the topic The WKB described in Section 3.3.1 is constructed based on the Library of Congress Subject Headings 2 LCSH system The LCSH system is a categorization developed for organizing the large volumes of library collections and for retrieving information from the library The subject headings in the LCSH are transformed into the subjects in WKB  and the LCSH structure is transformed into the backbone of WKB  Eventually the constructed WKB contains over 400,000 subjects covering various topics The semantic relations in the WKB are transformed from the references Broader term  Narrower term and Used-for  speci\002ed in the LCSH The Broader term and Narrower term references are transformed into hyponym/hypernym relations Used-for references are usually used in two situations to describe an action or to describe an object When object A is used for an action A actually becomes a part of that action like using turner in cooking when A is used for object B  A becomes a part of B  like“using wheels for a car Hence we transform the 2 http://classi\002cationweb.net

Used-for references in the LCSH into holonym/meronym relations in our WKB  In the experiments we assume that each topic comes from an individual user We attempt to evaluate our model in an environment that covers great range of topics However it is not realistic to expect a participant to hold such great range of topics in personal interests Thus for the 50 experimental topics we assume each one coming from an individual user and learn her his personalized ontology An LIR is collected through searching the subject catalogue of Queensland University of Technology QUT Library 3 by using the title of a topic Librarians have assigned title table of content summary and a list of subjects to each information item e.g a book stored in QUT library The assigned subjects are treated as the tags in Web documents that cite the knowledge in the WKB  In order to simplify the experiments we only use the librarian summarized information title table of content and summary to represent an instance in an LIR  All these information can be downloaded from QUT's Web site and are available to the public Once the WKB and an LIR are ready an ontology is learned as described in Section 3.3.1 and personalized as in Section 3.3.2 The user con\002dence rates on the subjects are speci\002ed as in Section 3.3.3 A document d i in the training set is then generated by an instance i  and its support value is determined by support  d i   X s 2 021  i  s 2S sup  s Q  14 where s 2 S in O  Q  are as de\002ned in De\002nition 5 As sup  s Q   0 for s 2 S 000 according to Eq 11 the documents with support  d   0 go to D 000  whereas those with support  d   0 go to D   4.4 Performance Measures The performance of the experimental models are measured by three methods the precision averages at eleven standard recall levels 11SPR the mean average precision MAP and the F 1 Measure They are all based on precision and recall the modern IR evaluation methods The 11SPR is reported suitable for information gathering and is used in TREC evaluations as a performance measuring standard An 11SPR v alue is computed by summing the interpolated precisions at the speci\002ed recall cutoff and then dividing by the number of topics P N i 1 precision 025 N  025  f 0  0  0  1  0  2      1  0 g  15 N is the number of topics and 025 are the cutoff points where the precisions are interpolated At each 025 point an aver3 http://library.qut.edu.au Figure 2 Experimental 11SPR Results age precision value over N topics is calculated These average precisions then link to a curve describing the recallprecision performance The MAP is a stable and discriminating choice in information gathering evaluations and is recommended for measuring general-purpose information gathering methods The average precision for each topic is the mean of the precision obtained after each relevant document is retrieved The MAP for the 50 experimental topics is then the mean of the average precision scores of each of the individual topics in the experiments The MAP re\003ects the performance in a non-interpolated recall-precision fashion F 1 Measure is also well accepted by the information gathering community which is calculated by F 1  2 002 precision 002 recall precision  recall  16 Precision and recall are evenly weighted in F 1 Measure For each topic the macro F 1 Measure averages the precision and recall and then calculates F 1 Measure whereas the micro F 1 Measure calculates the F 1 Measure for each returned result and then averages the F 1 Measure values The greater F 1 values indicate the better performance 5 Results and Discussions The experiments attempt to evaluate our proposed model by comparing to an implementation of mental model We expect that the ONTO model can achieve at least the close performance to the TREC model The experimental 11SPR results are illustrated in Fig 2 At recall point 0.3 the TREC model slightly outperformed the ONTO model but at 0.5 and 0.6 the ONTO model achieved better results than the TREC model subtly At all other points their 11SPR results are just the same For the MAP results shown on Table 1 the ONTO model achieved 0.284 which is just 0.006 below the TREC model 2

Table 1 the TREC model only outperformed the ONTO model by 0.002 0.5 in macro F 1 and 0.001 0.2 in micro F 1  The two models achieved almost the same performance The evaluation result is promising The statistical test is also performed on the experimental results in order to analyze the evaluation's reliability As suggested by we use the Student's Paired T-Test for the signi\002cance test The null hypothesis in our T-Test is that no difference exists in two comparing models When two tests produce substantially low p-value usually  0.05 the null hypothesis can be rejected In contrast when two tests produce high p-value usually  0.1 there is not or just little practical difference between two models The T-Test results are also presented on Table 1 The pvalue s show that there is no evidence of signi\002cant difference between two experimental models as the produced pvalue s are quite high  p-value 0.484\(MAP 0.862\(macroFM and 0.896\(micro-FM far greater than 0.1 Thus we can conclude that in terms of statistics our proposed model has the same performance as the golden TREC model and the evaluation result is reliable The advantage of the TREC model is that the experimental topics and the training sets are generated by the same linguists manually They as users perfectly know their information needs and what they are looking for in the training sets Therefore it is reasonable that the TREC model performed better than the ONTO model as we cannot expect that a computational model could outperform a such perfect manual model However the knowledge contained in TREC model's training sets is well formed for human beings to understand but not for computers The contained knowledge is not mathematically formalized and speci\002ed The ONTO model on the other hand formally speci\002es the user background knowledge and the related semantic relations using the world knowledge base and local instance repositories The mathematic formalizations are ideal for computers to understand This leverages the performance of the ONTO model As a result as shown on Fig 2 and Table 1 the ONTO model achieved almost the same performance as that of the TREC model 6 Conclusions In this paper an ontology-based knowledge IR framework is proposed aiming to discover a user's background knowledge to improve IR performance The framework consists of a user's mental model a querying model a computer model and an ontology model A world knowledge base is used by the computer model to construct an ontology to simulate a user's mental model and the ontology is personalized by using the user's local instance repository The semantic relations of hypernym/hyponym holonym/meronym and synonym are speci\002ed in the ontology model The framework is successfully evaluated by comparing to a manual user model The ontology-based framework is a novel contribution to knowledge engineering and Web information retrieval References   C Buckley and E M Voorhees Evaluating evaluation measure

support pruning gene expression classifier with an accurate and compact fuzzy rule base for microarray data analysis Biosystems vol 85 computationally challenging As training set sizes increase it is likely that these difficulties will also increase VI RELATED WORK While operating on a microarray dataset current CAR 1 2 3 4 and other pattern/rule 20 21 mining algorithms perform a pruned and/or compacted exponential search over either the space of gene subsets or the space of sample subsets Hence they are generally quite computationally expensive for datasets containing many training samples or genes as the case may be BSTC is explicitly related to CAR-based classifiers but requires no expensive CAR mining BSTC is also related to decision tree-based classifiers such as random forest 19 and C4.5 family 9 methods It is possible to represent any consistent set of boolean association rules as a decision tree and vice versa However it is generally unclear how the trees generated by current tree-based classifiers are related to high confidence/support CARs which are known to be particularly useful for microarray data 1 2 6 7 11 BSTC is explicitly related to and motivated by CAR-based methods To the best of our knowledge there is no previous work on mining/classifying with BARs of the form we consider here Perhaps the work closest to utilizing 100 BARs is the TOPRULES 22 miner TOP-RULES utilizes a data partitioning technique to compactly report itemlgene subsets which are unique to each class set Ci Hence TOP-RULES discovers all 100 confident CARs in a dataset However the method must utilize an emerging pattern mining algorithm such as MBD-LLBORDER 23 and so generally isn't polynomial time Also related to our BAR-based techniques are recent methods which mine gene expression training data for sets of fuzzy rules 24 25 Once obtained fuzzy rules can be used for classification in a manner analogous to CARs However the resulting fuzzy classifiers don't appear to be as accurate as standard classification methods such as SVM 25 VII CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK To address the computational difficulties involved with preclassification CAR mining see Tables IV and VI we developed a novel method which considers a larger subset of CAR-related boolean association rules BARs These rules can be compactly captured in a Boolean Structure Table BST which can then be used to produce a BST classifier called BSTC Comparison to the current leading CAR classifier RCBT on several benchmark microarray datasets shows that BSTC is competitive with RCBT's accuracy while avoiding the exponential costs incurred by CAR mining see Section VB Hence BSTC extends generalized CAR based methods to larger datasets then previously practical Furthermore unlike other association rule-based classifiers BSTC easily generalizes to multi-class gene expression datasets BSTC's worst case per-query classification time is worse then CAR-based methods after all exponential time CAR mining is completed O SlS CGl versus O Si CGi As future work we plan on investigating techniques to decrease this cost by carefully culling BST exclusion lists ACKNOWLEDGM[ENTS We thank Anthony K.H
