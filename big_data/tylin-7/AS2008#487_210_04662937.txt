Cooperative Recommendation System Based on Ontology Construction  Jike Ge    Yuhui Qiu Faculty of Computer and Information Science Southwest University Chongqing, China gjkid, yhqiu}@swu.edu.cn Zuqin Chen School of Economics and Administration Chongqing Three Gorges University Chongqing, China daodao@swu.edu.cn   Abstract In the traditional information service system, the lack of service personalization and semantic information influences the intelligence of information service, and decreases the quality of service. In this paper, we propose the cooperative recommendation system based on ontology construction. We first construct domain ontology, and construct user interest ontology by the mapping relations between user interest and domain ontology, and then we study the user interest ontology similarity measures. Through identifying the vertical weight by user interest similarity, the horizontal weight by time novelty, we use the improved weighted association rule algorithm to mining the concepts in user interest ontology, and exploit the user interest model. At last, we realize the semantic-based cooperative recommendation oriented to content Keywords: cooperative recommendation; ontology; user interest semantic I   I NTRODUCTION  For traditional information service system lack of personalized service and semantic, and the query based on literal matching, a new method that provide service based on content is required. At present, the important work is using new technology to improve service ability and enhance quality of service This paper uses ontology construction and association rule mining technology to propose a cooperative recommendation system that oriented to content. The system can deal with semantic in information service, and overcomes the weakness of traditional information service system The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the cooperative recommendation system model Section 3 introduces the key techniques of the system. Section 4 is devoted to analyse the principle of the system by an experiment. Section 5 provides some conclusions and discusses future work II  C OOPERATIVE R ECOMMENDATION S YSTEM M ODEL  The system integrates the advantage of personalized service and semantic retrieval, constructs user interest ontology by domain ontology, then uses user interest ontology to exploit user interest model, and uses association rule mining algorithm to assist cooperative recommendation and recommends resource intelligently.

     Figure 2  User interest modeling 1  Using domain ontology to construct user interest ontology User ontology is an explicit specification of user information, it points out the terminologies and relations of user concepts, and the semantic of terminologies. User interest ontology mainly describes the user interests, and shows the user interest attributes and their relations User interest information including: the keywords that user inputs; the bookmark or explorer favorite that user preserves the pages and documents that user browses; user’s browsing and picking behavior; Web logs or automatic records; the data that user downloads and preserves; the relative information that user inputs or customizes The system first mapping the user interest information to domain ontology, then getting ontology concepts set that user interested in. At last, representing user interest in ontology concepts, and generating user interest ontology 2  Using user interest ontology to mining user interest model Using the concepts set in user interest ontology through the semantic relations \(hypernymy, hyponymy and classesinstances\nd neighborhood paths, we divide user interest into several sub interest, and then model user interest The user interest is conceptual and semantic descript through ontology concepts set. Then, aggregating the concepts that user interested in according to the adjacency of ontology concepts. At last, the aggregated vectors form the user interest model. For the user interest is changing and adjusting through the process of system and user interaction, the weight of exist interest ontology nodes decays, while new interest ontology nodes increases, user interest should incremental update. Fig. 3 shows the user interest forming based on user interest ontology algorithm The user interest forming based on user interest ontology algorithm Input pretreatment vector V pre user interest ontology triple set O={C 002 R 002 C’}, interest division upper limit N the search control threshold of adjacency degree D Output user interest vector set V 0017 Forming candidate user interest vector V i  i 001\031 1,N  adj a ce nc y d e g r e e co nt ro l var i a b l e d 1  0018 while d<=D 002 scans the user interest ontology orderly take adjacency degree in ontology O as d to select concepts, infilling into candidate user interest vector V i  orderly, the adjacency degree d adding 1 automatically 0019 if pretreatment vector V pre not null, copy V pre to V N  001 output all candidate vector V i that are not null, i 001\031 1,N   Figure 3  The user interest forming based on user interest ontology algorithm C  The Cooperative Recommendation Based on Weighted Association Rule Mining The precondition of the cooperative recommendation oriented to users is that there is certain degree similarity between persons’ behavior, which indicates the users in same interest model may interest in same resource. The cooperative recommendation can help users finding new resource and new interest topics. In this paper, we intend to measure the correlation between ontology concepts and user interest by improved weighted association rule mining algorithm Compared with traditional association rule mining, the maximum characteristic of weighted association rule mining is the different treatment to item attributes. The algorithm we proposed forming weighted association rule sets by user interest. Forming weighted association rule sets involves transaction division, item weight setting, weighted support and weighted association rule defining, minimum weighted support threshold setting, and the weighted association rule mining algorithm 1  Transaction division We take the user’s every login as the basis of division transaction. User’s login usually has a major problem, although he/she may submit several problems and the problems may belong to different topics, all the problems are the reflection of user interest or demand at that time. When mining association rule, every login can take as one record, and every concept involved can take as an item 2  Weight setting a  User interest ontology similarity Although in same user model, the similarity among each user still has difference. The user’s interaction has difference for the interest similarity is different. The user interest similarity can be measured by user interest ontology similarity So we can take user interest ontology similarity as weight. The higher user interest ontology similarity is, the stronger interaction exists, and the higher weight should be given When measuring user interest ontology similarity, first could compute the similarity of the concepts involved, and then compute the user interest ontology similarity based on it. The computational process includes two steps

Step 1 Compute the similarity of concepts. Use WuPalmer similarity [5  an d  b a s e d  o n  Wo rd Net t o  c o m p u t e  2         2    cc cc ccc ccc cc 002\003 004 002\002 002 003 005  005 005 005 1 R 006  007 007 004  is a similarity over a hierarchy 010   007 H  003 is the root of the hierarchy     c c 002 is the number of intermediate edges between a class c and another class  c and  c c 005          c c c c c 010 005 010 011 007  For instance, to user interest ontology A and B, if we want to compute the similarity of concept A 1 in A and B 1 in B, after lookup WordNet to find the nodes they are in, using \(1\ can compute their similarity Step 2 Compute the similarity of user interest ontology. To any user interest ontology A and B, computing the similarity of m concepts in B and n concepts in A using Wu-Palmer similarity, the mean is the similarity of B to A. Shows as \(2  n m A B A B Sim m i n j j i   000¦\000  11       004 2 b  Time novelty The user interest is timely changing. When updating the user model, not only adds the latest interest characteristic words, but also adjusts the weight of exist characteristic words That is, introduces forgetting factor [6  T h e n e w u s er in te r e st  should consider priori and give higher weight, while the old should give smaller weight to reduce its reflection. In accordance to [3  th e w e ig h t settin g b a se d  o n tim e n o v e lty i s  as follows Let the candidate concepts series in domain ontology are C 1 C 2 C i C n the corresponding time-series in user access list is \(t 1 t 2 t i t n T max is the latest time in timeseries, T min is the oldest time in time-series, the weight of concept C i can compute as \(3  min max min 1     jj wtTTT 012\012    3 Where 001 is a constant, which can be defined by experience or experiment. In this paper, we take 001 as 0.5 3  Weighted support definition a  Vertical weighted support Give each user access record a vertical weight v i  i={1,2,…,n}\, v i is set according to the similarity of user interest ontology. To each itemset X \(X 001\031 I\, if X have vertical weight v i X have vertical weighted support   sup X v and  v n i i i v N X Count v X 000   1      sup 4 Where, Count\(X i is the amount of itemset X that have vertical weight v i N v is the total amount of weighted records  000   n i i i v N v N 1   5 Where, N i is the total amount of records that have vertical weight v i  To an itemset X, if X have vertical weighted support no smaller than minimum vertical weighted support, X is a vertical frequent itemset. Otherwise, X is a non vertical frequent itemset. If the rule X 000 Y has vertical weighted support no smaller than minimum vertical weighted support, and has vertical weighted confidence no smaller than minimum vertical weighted confidence, it is strong rule b  Horizontal weighted support Give each domain ontology concept i j in I={i 1 i 2 i m a horizontal weight h j i p 001\031 X, p={1,2,…,m}. The horizontal weighted support is   sup X h and   sup   1   sup X h k X X i j h p 000 011  6 sup\(X\ is the support of X, k is the amount of items in X h x    1 000 011 X i j p h k is the horizontal weight c  Mixed weighted support As above analyzed, we can finally get the mixed weighted association rules in cooperative recommendation. In records set T and itemsets I={i 1 i 2 i m we first give each record a vertical weight v j j={1,2,…,n}, each item i p a horizontal weight h p p={1,2,…,m}, h 1 0010 h 2  0010 h m then we define the mixed weighted support of itemset X is sup   sup   mxv X hX   1  1  p n ii i p iX v v Count X h kN  011  000 000 7 Count\(X i is the amount of itemset X that have vertical weight v i N v is the total amount of weighted records.  h X is the horizontal weight. To an itemset X, if X have mixed weighted support no smaller than wminsup \(minimum weighted support\, X is a mixed frequent itemset. If the rule X 000 Y has mixed weighted support no smaller than minimum weighted support, and has mixed weighted confidence no smaller than minimum weighted confidence, it is a strong rule 4  Minimum support threshold setting Too high or low threshold will reflect the rule mining very much. Setting the minimum support threshold manually may attempt several times. J. Duan proposes a measure that allows user setting multiple minimum supports [7 In  th is p a pe r  w e  propose a measure that setting minimum supports by controlling the proportion of frequent 1-itemsets. Setting the

In the experiment through mapping user interest information to domain ontology concepts, obtains a user interest model includes user A, B and C.

At last, we show the efficiency of our cooperative recommendation system through a simple experiment As the system fully considers the semantic factors and uses the user interest ontology to assist mining, it is more intelligent and personalized.

 Figure 11  Fixing the support of A priori algorithm Figure 12   Discovered associative rules of A priori algorithm C  Tests and results The implemented tool has been tested on the Computer Science Department database, and has permitted a useful analysis of available data The OLAP analysis module permits to explore the different analysis axis, and their influence in success or failure of students. So we can for example discover the tendency of a particular teacher to give bad or good marks. We can also verify the impact of the students’ absences, on their results in exams.   The difficulties met by the students in certain modules with regard to the others, were also revealed by the tool The results obtained at this level, could be exploited by the direction of the studies to make decisions like   Make sensitive the teachers to question their methods of evaluation   Increase the hourly volume of the modules the results of which are below the average   Make sensitive the administration for a more rigorous management of the absences of the students The data mining module allowed bringing to light abnormally weak correlations between the results obtained in modules of the same family \(data bases and information system, theory of the languages and compilation To mitigate these abnormalities, the implementation of inter-modular educational committees is recommended. These committees will group together teachers of these modules to compare the programs and the educational steps adopted, and to synchronize the contents and the methods of the educations IX  CONCLUSION In this paper, we are interested to design and implementation of a decisional tool, dedicated to analysis of pedagogical results, for improvement of higher education quality. The first version of our tool permits the use of OLAP operators to analyse marks through different axis. It also provides a data mining module based on associative rules discovery, to check association between the marks obtained in different pedagogical modules We consider that this work contribute to propose answers to the questions relative to the factors of failure and success of the students. Although some of these factors -such as the social situation of the students- are not controllable, it is possible to act on the others so as to maximize the chances of success of the students Our tool can be to use as support of help to the decisionmaking, for the improvement of the quality of education in the university As perspective of our work, we suggest to extend the data mining module by exploiting other techniques of data mining such as neurones nets A CKNOWLEDGMENT  We want to thank all the project team and particularly the students R.

This is indeed a revolutionary concept in the fields of exploration and development of petroleum fields, which has more future scope of commercial research 2 Data instances from CDP, COP, CRP, CSP dimensions can easily be structured and integrated in a warehouse environment for the purpose of interpreting seismic signals and their attributes as required by geologists, well planners, reservoir and production engineers 3 Framing of business rules, constraints among usage of attributes within th e integration process and design of business rules have definite impact on correlation and mapping and thus on data mining 4 Ontology based data structuring has definite advantage, especially when attributes and their relationships are conceptualized using appropriate semantics and contexts 5 Integrating on tologically structured data in a warehousing environment has more flexibility and consistency in attribute mapping and interpretation during data mining stage 6 Structural data views taken from implemented warehoused metadata fo llow definite structure shapes, in terms of seismic high and low data instances, depicting geological knowledge 7 Integration of exploratio n data, modeled from different hierarchically derived multiple dimensions; facilitate the data mining process thus extracting knowledge of commercial petroleum plays. Issues of reuse and interoperability of denormalized fine-grained exploration data structures have also been emphasized in the context of implementing ontology based warehousing in petroleum exploration industries This research work addresses new methodologies, which have the potential to revolutionize the exploration and resources industries worldwide This is an on-going commercial research work at Curtin Business School Curtin University of Tech nology, Au stralia.

Table 1 the TREC model only outperformed the ONTO model by 0.002 0.5 in macro F 1 and 0.001 0.2 in micro F 1  The two models achieved almost the same performance The evaluation result is promising The statistical test is also performed on the experimental results in order to analyze the evaluation's reliability As suggested by we use the Student's Paired T-Test for the signi\002cance test The null hypothesis in our T-Test is that no difference exists in two comparing models When two tests produce substantially low p-value usually  0.05 the null hypothesis can be rejected In contrast when two tests produce high p-value usually  0.1 there is not or just little practical difference between two models The T-Test results are also presented on Table 1 The pvalue s show that there is no evidence of signi\002cant difference between two experimental models as the produced pvalue s are quite high  p-value 0.484\(MAP 0.862\(macroFM and 0.896\(micro-FM far greater than 0.1 Thus we can conclude that in terms of statistics our proposed model has the same performance as the golden TREC model and the evaluation result is reliable The advantage of the TREC model is that the experimental topics and the training sets are generated by the same linguists manually They as users perfectly know their information needs and what they are looking for in the training sets Therefore it is reasonable that the TREC model performed better than the ONTO model as we cannot expect that a computational model could outperform a such perfect manual model However the knowledge contained in TREC model's training sets is well formed for human beings to understand but not for computers The contained knowledge is not mathematically formalized and speci\002ed The ONTO model on the other hand formally speci\002es the user background knowledge and the related semantic relations using the world knowledge base and local instance repositories The mathematic formalizations are ideal for computers to understand This leverages the performance of the ONTO model As a result as shown on Fig 2 and Table 1 the ONTO model achieved almost the same performance as that of the TREC model 6 Conclusions In this paper an ontology-based knowledge IR framework is proposed aiming to discover a user's background knowledge to improve IR performance The framework consists of a user's mental model a querying model a computer model and an ontology model A world knowledge base is used by the computer model to construct an ontology to simulate a user's mental model and the ontology is personalized by using the user's local instance repository The semantic relations of hypernym/hyponym holonym/meronym and synonym are speci\002ed in the ontology model The framework is successfully evaluated by comparing to a manual user model The ontology-based framework is a novel contribution to knowledge engineering and Web information retrieval References   C Buckley and E M Voorhees Evaluating evaluation measure

support pruning gene expression classifier with an accurate and compact fuzzy rule base for microarray data analysis Biosystems vol 85 computationally challenging As training set sizes increase it is likely that these difficulties will also increase VI RELATED WORK While operating on a microarray dataset current CAR 1 2 3 4 and other pattern/rule 20 21 mining algorithms perform a pruned and/or compacted exponential search over either the space of gene subsets or the space of sample subsets Hence they are generally quite computationally expensive for datasets containing many training samples or genes as the case may be BSTC is explicitly related to CAR-based classifiers but requires no expensive CAR mining BSTC is also related to decision tree-based classifiers such as random forest 19 and C4.5 family 9 methods It is possible to represent any consistent set of boolean association rules as a decision tree and vice versa However it is generally unclear how the trees generated by current tree-based classifiers are related to high confidence/support CARs which are known to be particularly useful for microarray data 1 2 6 7 11 BSTC is explicitly related to and motivated by CAR-based methods To the best of our knowledge there is no previous work on mining/classifying with BARs of the form we consider here Perhaps the work closest to utilizing 100 BARs is the TOPRULES 22 miner TOP-RULES utilizes a data partitioning technique to compactly report itemlgene subsets which are unique to each class set Ci Hence TOP-RULES discovers all 100 confident CARs in a dataset However the method must utilize an emerging pattern mining algorithm such as MBD-LLBORDER 23 and so generally isn't polynomial time Also related to our BAR-based techniques are recent methods which mine gene expression training data for sets of fuzzy rules 24 25 Once obtained fuzzy rules can be used for classification in a manner analogous to CARs However the resulting fuzzy classifiers don't appear to be as accurate as standard classification methods such as SVM 25 VII CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK To address the computational difficulties involved with preclassification CAR mining see Tables IV and VI we developed a novel method which considers a larger subset of CAR-related boolean association rules BARs These rules can be compactly captured in a Boolean Structure Table BST which can then be used to produce a BST classifier called BSTC Comparison to the current leading CAR classifier RCBT on several benchmark microarray datasets shows that BSTC is competitive with RCBT's accuracy while avoiding the exponential costs incurred by CAR mining see Section VB Hence BSTC extends generalized CAR based methods to larger datasets then previously practical Furthermore unlike other association rule-based classifiers BSTC easily generalizes to multi-class gene expression datasets BSTC's worst case per-query classification time is worse then CAR-based methods after all exponential time CAR mining is completed O SlS CGl versus O Si CGi As future work we plan on investigating techniques to decrease this cost by carefully culling BST exclusion lists ACKNOWLEDGM[ENTS We thank Anthony K.H
