Association rule mining is one of the most important fields in data mining and knowledge discovery in databases.Rules  explosion   is  a  serious problem which causes great concerned,as conventional mining algorithms often produce too many rules for decision makers to digest. Since Web-based MobileLearning System collects vast amounts of learners profile data, data mining and knowledge discovery techniques can be applied to find interesting relationships between attributes of learners assessments, the solution strategies adopted by learners and so on. Therefore ,this paper concentrates on a new data-mining algorithm,combined with the advantages of improved genetic agorithm,called ARGA\(Association rules based on an improved Genetic Algorithm\, to mine the association rules from a Web-based Mobile-Learning system. This paper first takes advantage of the genetic algorithm designed specifically for discovering association rules Moreover, the analysis and experimenst are also made to show the proposed method is more efficient and accurate than the Apriori algorithm in MobileLearning system  1. Introduction  The development of Internet and Mobile technologies have created new ways and defined new relationships between educators and learners. Mobilelearning\(m-learning\ inherits advantages from elearning, but extends research by making use of portable\(handheld\ wireless technologies [1  M learning is the exciting art of using mobile technologies to enhance the learning experience.Mobile phones, digital media players \(e.g iPods, MP4 players\, PDAs\(e.g. Palm, Pocket PC\ and the Internet can be blended to engage and motivate learners, any time and anywhere.Recently,the fastest growing web community has been mobile visitors who browse web pages or retrieve web information using PDAs or cell phones via wireless networks.Similarly the development of educational technologies recently has tended to be mobilized,portable, and personalized.These trends have led to learning forms changing from traditional classroom learning to electronic learning,or mobile- learning.Among these novel learning forms,mobile- learning is effective and flexible;that is,mobile- learning can overcome restrictions of time and space, enabling learners to study whenever and wherever possible [2  M o d er n  learners have increasing demands on their time and are often forced to study in their lunch breaks, in the evenings and at weekends; and to study at work or on the bus, train or in the car. They also facilitate learning where learners can often take advantage of unexpected free time since they frequently have their devices with them.The Mobile-Learning researchers focused on applying distance learning techniques to mobile devices instead of desktops. Learners studied the sequence of instruction developed and experimented by transforming traditional distance education into a form more suitable for a Mobile-Learning environment. HuaZhong Normal University has pioneered some learning systems to provide an infrastructure.The research presented here is performed on a part of Web-Based Mobile-Learning System ,The research of foreign Chinese long-distance visualized teaching model,in this University Data Mining,as one of the promising technologies since 1990s, is the iterative and interactive process of extracting desirable konwledge or interesring valid novel, useful, and understandable patterns form existing and massive databases for specific purposes Data Mining means searching for valuable information in large volumes of data, using exploration and analysis, by automatic or semi-automatic means, of large quantities of data in order to discover meaningful patterns and rules.Data mining can be categorized into several interesting areas, such as clustering, association rules, decision tree analysis, prediction, regression, etc  I n pa rt i c ul a r  s i n c e A g ra w a l  Im i e l i n s k i   a n d

  Swarmi introduced the notion of  association rules in 1993  a s s o c i a t i o n  rul e  m i ni n g p l a y s a ke y r o l e i n  boosting the research, development and application of data mining techniques.This leads to a great many significant technologies and methodologies for identifying association rules ,and association rule mining becomes one of the widest applied data mining styles.Meanwhile,association rule mining has attracted more and more attention of academia and practitioners with applications such as customer relation management,market baskets,economic and financial time-series analysis methods, production process manufacturing diagnosis, etc 6     Genetic Algorithm \(GA\,has been shown to be an effective tool to use in association rule mining and pattern recognition[7    2. Association rules and the Definition of Problem  The problem of mining association rules was introduced in 1993 by Agrawal [2 H e r e a r e  t h e  general notations and definitions I m i i i    2 1  set of items D = set of transactions; each transaction T is included in I X = set of items from I, T contains X An association rule is a pair X  Y, where X  I Y  I, X Y   The association rule here is an implication of the form where X is the conjunction of conditions, and Y is the type of classification. Each rule has an associated support and confidence . The support S\(X  Y\ of the rule is the measure of frequency both X and Y in D S\(X  Y      D T T Y X T     D 1 The confidence measure C\(X  Y\ of Rule is for the premise that includes X in the bargain descend, in the meantime includes Y C\(X  Y     D T T Y X T     D T T X T     2  3. The Structure and Description of ARGA  3.1. Genetic Algorithm \(GA  Genetic Algorithm \(GA\,has been shown to be an effective tool to use in association rule mining and pattern recognition. GA is a self-adaptive optimization searching algorithm,and it obtains the best solution, or the most satisfactory solution through generations of chromosomes constant evolution includes reproduction, crossover and mutation etc Here is the general description of this problem F\(t\ = a  S\(t\ + b  C\(t\                                      \(3 where,a, b is constants,0  a  1,0  b  1;S\(t\ is the support, and C\(t\ is the confidence  3.2. Encoding and the Initiation Population  This paper employs the natural number to encode the variable ij  That is, the number of the lines of every range in the matrix  in which the element 1 exists is regarded as a gene. Meanwhile,the genes are independent of each other. And ,they are marked by 1 K  2 K  j K  n K in which j K  1,n   j   1,n a nd n K may be a repeatedly equal natural number When the distributive method at random is employed to produce the initial population comprised of certain individuals, the population must be in a certain scale in order to achieve the optimal solution on the whole. The best way is the generated M individuals randomly that the length is n, then the chromosome bunch encoded by the natural number is calculated as the initial population  3.3. The Fitness Function  Each individual is assigned a fitness value derived from its raw performance measure given by the objective function. This value is used in the selection to bias towards more fit individuals. Highly fit individuals, relative to the whole population, have a high probability of being selected for mating whereas less fit individuals have a correspondingly low probability of being selected. Therefore,in this paper,the fieness function is as follow       2 1   min min C R C S R S R f    4 In which, R is a pair X  Y. is min S minimum support, and min C is minimum confidence  3.4. Reproduction Operator  Reproduction is the transmission of personal information from the father generation to the son generation. Each individual in each generation determines the probability that it can reproduce the next generation according to how big or small the fitness value is. Through reproducing, the number of

  excellent individuals in the population increases constantly, and the whole process of evolution head for the optimal direction. We are adopting roulette selection strategy; each individual reproduction probability is proportion to fitness value [8   1\ Computing thereproduction probability of all the individuals     M i i f i f i P 1       5 2\  Generate a number r randomly, r=random [0, 1  3\ If P\(0\+ P\(1\+…+ P\(i-1\<r< P\(0\+ P\(1 P\(i\,the individual i is selected into the next generation  3.5. Crossover Operator  The crossover operation is not necessarily performed on all strings in the population. Instead, it is applied with a probability Pc when the pairs are chosen for breeding .The crossover probability Pc directly influences the convergence of the algorithm. The larger Pc is the most likely is the genetic mode of the optimal individual to be destroyed .However, the over-small of Pc can slow down the research process [9  H e r e i s th e definition of the crossover operator 1\ Computing crossover probability Pc        8  0           05  0 8  0 min max X f X f X f X f Pc            X f X f X f X f    6 In which   max X f is the maximum fitness value of the population   min X f is the minimum fitness value of the population and    X f is the average fitness value of the population 2\Generate a number c r randomly ,in which c r random[0  i f  c r Pc,then conducting the following formula  Offspring = parent1 c r parent2 – parent1\        \(7 And formula above is properly transformed into the following formula           1 2  2 2 1  1  1   1  V r V r V V r V r V c c c c 8 In which 2 1  V V are both father indiviuals,and  2  1  V V are both sons indiviuals 3.6. Mutation Operator  A further genetic operator, mutation is applied to the new chromosomes, with a set probability Pm. Mutation causes the individual genetic representation to be changed according to some probabilistic rule.Mutation is generally considered to be a back-ground operator that ensures that the probability of searching a particular subspace of the problem space is never zero This has the effect of tending to inhibit the possibility of converging to a local optimum, rather than the global optimum.The selection of the mutation probability Pm is the vital point because it influences the action and performance of ARGA.hereis the defintion of the mutation operator Computing the mutation crossover probability Pm      02  0           08  0 02  0 min max X f X f X f X f Pc            X f X f X f X f    9  In which   max X f is the maximum fitness value of the population   min X f is the maximum fitness value of the population,and   X f is the average fitness value of the population  3.7. Termination Condition  When the matching error 0 012  or the condition is not coincident, the process will naturally stop  4. Simulation Experiments and Result Analysis In order to measure the proposed ARGA performances and accuracy, an experiment was set up using an intranet network that connects four local area networks \(each with ten IBM Compatible PCs of Intel Pentium IV CPU 2.40 GHz,1 GB of main memory\,with the WindowsXP and Linux operating systems. Both algorithms were implemented using Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0. The experiment data included the synthetic and real data For ARGA,we used 300 individuals in our population.First,we compare the performance of our proposed method with the classical Apriori algorithm.Fig.1 shows the relationship between runtime and minimum support value for both algorithms.As the value of minimum support increases the runtimes of both algorithms decrease; nevertheless the runtime of Apriori algorithm is 2-3 times more than ARGA when the the value of minimum support is low

Conclusions and future work With the development of Internet and Mobile technologies,Web-based Mobile-Learning System has created new ways for educators to communicate with learners.Since Web-based Mobile-Learning System collects vast amounts of learner  profile data, data mining and knowledge discovery techniques can be applied to find interesting relationships.Most association rule mining algorithms suffer from the twin problems of too much execution time and generating too many association rules. In this paper, we foucs on an improved data-mining algorithm, called ARGA to to address the first problem from a Web-based MobileLearning system. We have implemented the algorithms proposed in this paper .Moreover,the research presented here is performed on a part of Web-Based Mobile-Learning System developed at HuaZhong Normal University.The analysis and experiment results are also made to show that the proposed method ARGA runs 2–3 times faster than the classical Apriori algorithm in Mobile-Learning system Future work is focused on the evaluation and optimisation of the association rules discovery system implementation.Another important issue is the implementation combing ARGA with Apriori algorithm. So,we will futher generalize our approach to manage the proposed ARGA in other fields  6.

We made a set of comparing experiments between FPclose and GTCWFPMiner among min-sup number of patterns Max_L and execution time et. al. The difference between GTCWFPMiner and FPclose  results from weight constraints Figure 11 shows the trend of the execution time of GTCWFPMiner and FPclose with respect to different specified minimum support threshold min-sup based on Max_L=7 As shown in figure, as min-sup decreasing the average execution time increases. When the min-sup is lowered, the performance diffe rence becomes larger. In all case of min-sup  GTCWFPMiner outperforms algorithm FPclose. This is because GTCWFPMiner carries out the closed frequent pattern mining with weight constraints and can reduced effectively search space, but FPclose do the closed frequent pattern mining without weight constraints, its search space is larger than algorithm GTCWFPMiner Figure 12 shows the trend of the number of patterns & runtime w.r.t Max_L As shown in Fig 12\(a GTCWFPMiner generates fewer patterns than FPclose. The difference of the number of patterns between two algorithms becomes smaller as the Max_L increases. In Fig. 12\(b GTCWFPMiner is faster than FPclose. The performance difference becomes larger when Max_L becomes longer. Figure 13 shows GTCWFPMiner has much better scale-up properties than FPclose for the numbers of nodes & traversal transactions  min-sup 15%\n the figure 13\(a\although itself runtime also increases GTCWFPMiner runs faster than FPclose as the number nodes increases. In figure 13\(b GTCWFPMiner also has a better scalability in terns of number of traversal transactions and runs faster than FPclose. Our own experimental evaluation \(not presented in this paper\that WTMaxMiner is equally effective for other value of Max_L and min-sup as well  6. Conclusions and future works  This paper explores the problem of discovering closed frequent patterns from traversals on WDG A transformable model between EWDG and VWDG is proposed Based on the model, we present the mining algorithm named GTCWFPMiner This algorithm exploits a divideand-conquer approach in a bottom-up pattern-growth manner and incorporates the closure property with weight constrains to reduce effectiv ely search space and extracts succinct and lossless patterns from graph traversal TDB Experimental results show the algorithm is an effective and scalable algorithm for CWFP based on graph traversals. How to scale the model and algorithm proposed in this paper to a larger scale, e.g., Web-size scale and other large relation models etc.; can we deeply optimize the algorithm, and how to efficiently put it into practice are still be worthy doing further exploring for researches  7.

If in Fig. 4 there is at least one T, then DCAR6 holds DCAR1 through DCAR6 forms a complement lattice shown in Fig. 5 In Fig. 5, the lower rule implies the upper rule That is, if DCARj is reachable from DCARi via an ascending path, and DCARi holds, then DCARj holds Because DCAR1 through DCAR6 satisfies Fig 5, their algorithms can be merged into one algorithm called connective determination algorithm, shown in Fig. 6 Suppose cf 1 80%, cf 2 75%. In Fig. 4, for the column of C1, there are M*cf 1 5*80%=4 elements whose values are T \(namely, S1, S2, S3, S5 Therefore, DCAR2: course\(Cno 004 1  student\(Sno 003 1  study\(Sno, Cno\olds. From Fig. 5, we know that DCAR3 and DCAR6 also hold. In Fig. 4, there are at least N*cf 2 4*75%=3 columns which have value T \(namely, in the column of C1 there is S1, in the column of C2 there is S1, in the column of C3 there is S2, in the column of C4 there is S5 therefore DCAR5: course\(Cno 003 1  student\(Sno 004 1  study\(Sno, Cno  VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS 1\ Double-connective association rule mining is different from single-connective association rule mining. The former mines the association among the primary keys of the two entity tables and the primary key of the binary relationship table. The latter mines the association between frequent item sets 2\. 4 is different from data cubes in data warehouses. The elements in Fig. 4 are T or F. The elements in the data cubes are data 3\The differences between double-connective association rule and database query are that, first, the query information in databases are predeterminate while the information to be mined by double-connective association rule is not predeterminate, it is implied. Secondly, database query needs to write SQL statements, while double-connective association rule mining is automatic. Thirdly, the information obtained by database query is quantitative, while the information obtained by double-connective association rule mining is qualitative such as “for many”, “there are some  REFERENCES 1 Ji a w ei H a n   M i ch eli n e K a m b er   D a t a  M i n i n g C onc ep t s  a nd Techniques, Higher Education Press, Beijing, 2001, Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, 2000 2 A  G  Ha m i lt on  L o gi c for M a th em a t i c ia ns R evi s ed E d i t i o n   Cambridge University Press, 1988, Tsinghua University Press Beijing, 2003 3 X unw e i Z h o u   Br ie f I ntr o du c t io n  to  Mu t u al l y I nve r s is tic Logic”, 1999 European Summer Meeting of the Association for Symbolic Logic, Utrecht, The Netherlands, August 1-6 1999 4 u n w ei Zh ou F i r s t leve l exp l i c i t m u lt ip le i ndu ct i v e composition”, 2005 Spring Meeting of the Association for Symbolic Logic, The Westin St. Francis Hotel, San Francisco CA.

support pruning gene expression classifier with an accurate and compact fuzzy rule base for microarray data analysis Biosystems vol 85 computationally challenging As training set sizes increase it is likely that these difficulties will also increase VI RELATED WORK While operating on a microarray dataset current CAR 1 2 3 4 and other pattern/rule 20 21 mining algorithms perform a pruned and/or compacted exponential search over either the space of gene subsets or the space of sample subsets Hence they are generally quite computationally expensive for datasets containing many training samples or genes as the case may be BSTC is explicitly related to CAR-based classifiers but requires no expensive CAR mining BSTC is also related to decision tree-based classifiers such as random forest 19 and C4.5 family 9 methods It is possible to represent any consistent set of boolean association rules as a decision tree and vice versa However it is generally unclear how the trees generated by current tree-based classifiers are related to high confidence/support CARs which are known to be particularly useful for microarray data 1 2 6 7 11 BSTC is explicitly related to and motivated by CAR-based methods To the best of our knowledge there is no previous work on mining/classifying with BARs of the form we consider here Perhaps the work closest to utilizing 100 BARs is the TOPRULES 22 miner TOP-RULES utilizes a data partitioning technique to compactly report itemlgene subsets which are unique to each class set Ci Hence TOP-RULES discovers all 100 confident CARs in a dataset However the method must utilize an emerging pattern mining algorithm such as MBD-LLBORDER 23 and so generally isn't polynomial time Also related to our BAR-based techniques are recent methods which mine gene expression training data for sets of fuzzy rules 24 25 Once obtained fuzzy rules can be used for classification in a manner analogous to CARs However the resulting fuzzy classifiers don't appear to be as accurate as standard classification methods such as SVM 25 VII CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK To address the computational difficulties involved with preclassification CAR mining see Tables IV and VI we developed a novel method which considers a larger subset of CAR-related boolean association rules BARs These rules can be compactly captured in a Boolean Structure Table BST which can then be used to produce a BST classifier called BSTC Comparison to the current leading CAR classifier RCBT on several benchmark microarray datasets shows that BSTC is competitive with RCBT's accuracy while avoiding the exponential costs incurred by CAR mining see Section VB Hence BSTC extends generalized CAR based methods to larger datasets then previously practical Furthermore unlike other association rule-based classifiers BSTC easily generalizes to multi-class gene expression datasets BSTC's worst case per-query classification time is worse then CAR-based methods after all exponential time CAR mining is completed O SlS CGl versus O Si CGi As future work we plan on investigating techniques to decrease this cost by carefully culling BST exclusion lists ACKNOWLEDGM[ENTS We thank Anthony K.H
