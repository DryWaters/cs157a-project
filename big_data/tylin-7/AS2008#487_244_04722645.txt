Mining Both Positive and Negative Weighted Association Rules with Multiple Minimum Supports  000\003 He Jiang, Yuanyuan Zhao, Chunhua Yang, Xiangjun Dong  School of Information Science and Technology Shandong Institute of Light Industry Jinan, China jianghe@sdili.edu.cn, xiaofengye 1013@163.com, ych@sdili.edu.cn, d-xj@163.com   Abstract Association rule mining is an important model in data mining. Many mining algorithms discover all item associations or rules\n the data that satisfy the user-specified minimum support and minimum confidence constraints. The weights are associated with the items to solve the question of different importance of the items. But there is another case that the frequency of every item is different from each other. Traditional single support threshold can’t mine association rules effectively In this paper, the efficient mining of multiple-level association rule is proposed to resolve the above question. This method can not  only discover associations that span different hierarchy levels but also have high potential to produce rare but informative item rules. Moreover, an algorithm for mining positive and the negative weighted association rules based on multiple minimum supports is designed simultaneously Keywords-weight; multiple minimum support; negative association rule; correlation WPNMS  I   I NTRODUCTION  Association Rule is an important type of knowledge representation revealing implicit relationships among the items present in large number of transactions. Association rule mining \(ARM\s firstly proposed by R.Agrawal, T.Imielinski and A.Swam in 1993[1 A n al g o ri t h m of  m i n i ng ru l e s pu t  forward in 3 l l t h e i t e m s i n a dat a bas e are t r eat ed  in a uniform in the traditional Algorithm Apriori. But the items are different from each other because of the concern of the users. Generally, the users pay more attention to the items that is profitable. If an item is interesting for the decision-maker then it is set a high weight. The model of weighted association rule and corresponding algorithm is  proposed by C. H. Cai et  n e f f i cie n t m i n i ng  meth od f o r W e igh t ed A s s o ciati o n  Rules \(WAR\ put forw  The minimum support is the key element that makes association rule mining more practical. It is used to prune the search space and to limit the number of rules generated Traditional algorithm of mining association rule is based upon the single minimum support on condition that the items in the data have the same frequency. But there is another case in real application that the frequency of every item is different from each other. In the case, if the user-specified minimum support is too high, then the items with low frequency of appearance can’t be mined. Otherwise, if the user-specified minimum support is too low, then combination explosion may occur. We adopt multiple minimum support thresholds. The technique allows the user to specify multiple minimum supports to reflect the natures of the items and their varied frequencies in the database. Liu et al. proposed am approach for mining association rules with non-uniform minimum support values in  Wan g et al propos ed a m i n i n g  m e t h od w h i c h al l o w e d t h e mining support value of an item to be a function of minimum support valves of items constrained in the itemset o efficient algorithms called MMS_Cumulate and MMS_Stratify, were designed in t h i s paper, t h e m e t hod  of multiple minimum supports is applied to weighted association rules Negative association rules \(NARs\ mining has received much attention recently. Sometimes the decision-makers are concerned with the patterns that are low frequent but correlated strongly to reduce the negative influence that the disadvantageous factors bring on. The rules of the form A 000 B which suggests that a customer may not buy item B  after the customer buys item A together with the rules of the forms A 000 B and A 000 B are called negative association rules and the rules of the form A 000 B positive association rules PARs  The problem of identifying negative associations or “dissociations”\sing also the absence of item sets has been explored and considered relevant [10   We extend the existing association rule model to allow the user to specify multiple minimum supports to reflect different natures and/or frequencies of items. Specifically, the user can specify a different minimum item support for each item. At the same time, an algorithm for mining the positive and negative weighted association rules with multiple minimum supports WPNMS\ is proposed. Experiment shows that the algorithm is effective  II  P ROBLEM S TATEMENT AND R ELATED W ORK  A  Formulation of Weighted Association Rules Weighted Association Rules is as follows: there are n  records and m items  Let I  i 1 i 2 i m be a set of items and W  w 1  w 2  w m  w i 002  002 be the set of non-negative real numbers  A pair X  w  X alled a weighted item where X 002 I  is an item and w  X  002 W is the weight associated with X A This work was partly supported by Young Scientist Foundation of Shandong Province China \(2006BS01017\ and Nature Science Foundation of Shandong Province China \(Y2007G25

transaction is a set of weighted items, each of which may appear in multiple transactions with different weights  A dataset may therefore be defined as a set D of transactions  Given a weighted itemset X and a set of transactions referred to as D we say X has support in D if s of transactions in D support X The weighted support of an itemset X in a dataset D denoted as wsup\(X\ = countD\(X\|D|*w\(X  1 where countD\(X is the number of transactions in D  containing X Note that the support of a weighted itemset X is always less than or equal to the support of any of its generalization There are several different formulations for the weighted support of the rule X 000 Y according to the different demand where X 003 I, Y 003 I and X 004 Y 005 In this paper the following form is used wsup  X 000 Y  avg  w 1  w 2  w p  006 sup  X 000 Y 2 where p is the items’ count of the itemset X  avg  w 1  w 2  w p is the average value of the weight of itemset X 007 Y and sup  X 000 Y s support of itemset X 007 Y before the item is associated with weight The confidence of the WAR denoted as wconf is the ratio of the weighted support of X*Y over the weighted support of X  B  Calculate Measures of Weighted Negative Association Rules There are very few papers to discuss and discover negative association rules. Brin et.al[12 e n tio n e d f o r th e f i rst ti m e in  the literature the notion of negative relationships. In   ch  positive rule X 000 Y correspond three negative ones X 000  Y   X 000 Y and  X 000  Y A transaction t supports X 000  Y if X 010 t  and Y 011 t  In t h e a u t hor s pro p o s e d  a si m p l e b u t e ffi c i e n t m e t hod to calculate the support and confidence of NARs through positive association rules’. In [15  th e  c o r r e lat i o n  is ap p l ie d  t o  the weighted association rules model to mining the positive and negative association rules C  Definition of Correlation Measure Some problems such as self-contradictory rules may occur when studying both the positive and negative association rules Therefore another parameter is added to eliminate these misleading rules, many kinds of measure are proposed, such as correlation. The definition of the correlation is as follows corr A,B     wsup A B wsup A wsup B 007 3 There are three possible cases for the values of the correlation corr A,B if corr A,B  1 then the two variables are independent. When corr A,B 1 the two variables considered are perfectly positive correlated. Similarly, when corr A,B  1  the variables considered are perfectly negative correlated Moreover, there are such relationships between the four forms: if corr A,B   1 then corr A  B   1  corr  A,B   1   corr  A   B  1 and vice versa III  A LGORITHM D ESIGN  A  Definition of Multiple Minimum Supports In multiple-support model, every item has different support constraint Any item i j of the itemset I  i 1 i 2 i m is predefined a minimum support value, called minimum support of item denoted as smin\(i j  Definition  1 The minimum weighted support for an itemset X 003 I is set as the minimum of minimum support of the items contained in the itemset, denoted as smin_itemset\(X  Definition 2 An itemset X is said to be weighted-frequent large\ its weighted support is larger than a user-specified value of the itemset \(also called minimum weighted support wminsup\(X  B  A Proposed Algorithm for Mining Weighted Association Rules with Multiple Level The task of mining association rules is usually decomposed into two steps   Itemset  generation: find all large itemsets that have support exceeding a threshold minimum support   Rule construction: from the set of large itemsets construct all association rules that have a confidence exceeding a threshold minimum confidence The frequent items are generated by the method of levelwise search. The Apriori closure property is no longer in point when every item is associated with weight. Therefore, the k Support Bound of itemset is calculated in the pruning process The proposed algorithm first finds all the large 1 itemsets L 1  for the given transactions by comparing the support of each item with its predefined minimum support. Then, calculate all the 1 itemsets, and put the items whose weighted support is larger than predefined minimum support and the itemset whose  k Support Bound \(function ksb s less than its support count into C 1 After that, candidate 2 itemsets C 2 can be formed from C 1 The frequent k-1 itemset is joined with itself to generate candidate k itemset when k>2  The most common framework in the association rules generation is the “support-confidence” one. Although these two parameters allow the pruning of many associations that are discovered in data, there are cases when many uninteresting even self-contrary rules may be produced especially when both positive and negative association rules are mined simultaneous. The correlation measure is added to the framework to eliminate the self-contrary rules C  Algorithm Description The main procedure of Algorithm WPNMS Input L  T transaction database wminsup   minimum weighted supports wminconf minimum weighted confidence

We made a set of comparing experiments between FPclose and GTCWFPMiner among min-sup number of patterns Max_L and execution time et. al. The difference between GTCWFPMiner and FPclose  results from weight constraints Figure 11 shows the trend of the execution time of GTCWFPMiner and FPclose with respect to different specified minimum support threshold min-sup based on Max_L=7 As shown in figure, as min-sup decreasing the average execution time increases. When the min-sup is lowered, the performance diffe rence becomes larger. In all case of min-sup  GTCWFPMiner outperforms algorithm FPclose. This is because GTCWFPMiner carries out the closed frequent pattern mining with weight constraints and can reduced effectively search space, but FPclose do the closed frequent pattern mining without weight constraints, its search space is larger than algorithm GTCWFPMiner Figure 12 shows the trend of the number of patterns & runtime w.r.t Max_L As shown in Fig 12\(a GTCWFPMiner generates fewer patterns than FPclose. The difference of the number of patterns between two algorithms becomes smaller as the Max_L increases. In Fig. 12\(b GTCWFPMiner is faster than FPclose. The performance difference becomes larger when Max_L becomes longer. Figure 13 shows GTCWFPMiner has much better scale-up properties than FPclose for the numbers of nodes & traversal transactions  min-sup 15%\n the figure 13\(a\although itself runtime also increases GTCWFPMiner runs faster than FPclose as the number nodes increases. In figure 13\(b GTCWFPMiner also has a better scalability in terns of number of traversal transactions and runs faster than FPclose. Our own experimental evaluation \(not presented in this paper\that WTMaxMiner is equally effective for other value of Max_L and min-sup as well  6. Conclusions and future works  This paper explores the problem of discovering closed frequent patterns from traversals on WDG A transformable model between EWDG and VWDG is proposed Based on the model, we present the mining algorithm named GTCWFPMiner This algorithm exploits a divideand-conquer approach in a bottom-up pattern-growth manner and incorporates the closure property with weight constrains to reduce effectiv ely search space and extracts succinct and lossless patterns from graph traversal TDB Experimental results show the algorithm is an effective and scalable algorithm for CWFP based on graph traversals. How to scale the model and algorithm proposed in this paper to a larger scale, e.g., Web-size scale and other large relation models etc.; can we deeply optimize the algorithm, and how to efficiently put it into practice are still be worthy doing further exploring for researches  7.

If in Fig. 4 there is at least one T, then DCAR6 holds DCAR1 through DCAR6 forms a complement lattice shown in Fig. 5 In Fig. 5, the lower rule implies the upper rule That is, if DCARj is reachable from DCARi via an ascending path, and DCARi holds, then DCARj holds Because DCAR1 through DCAR6 satisfies Fig 5, their algorithms can be merged into one algorithm called connective determination algorithm, shown in Fig. 6 Suppose cf 1 80%, cf 2 75%. In Fig. 4, for the column of C1, there are M*cf 1 5*80%=4 elements whose values are T \(namely, S1, S2, S3, S5 Therefore, DCAR2: course\(Cno 004 1  student\(Sno 003 1  study\(Sno, Cno\olds. From Fig. 5, we know that DCAR3 and DCAR6 also hold. In Fig. 4, there are at least N*cf 2 4*75%=3 columns which have value T \(namely, in the column of C1 there is S1, in the column of C2 there is S1, in the column of C3 there is S2, in the column of C4 there is S5 therefore DCAR5: course\(Cno 003 1  student\(Sno 004 1  study\(Sno, Cno  VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS 1\ Double-connective association rule mining is different from single-connective association rule mining. The former mines the association among the primary keys of the two entity tables and the primary key of the binary relationship table. The latter mines the association between frequent item sets 2\. 4 is different from data cubes in data warehouses. The elements in Fig. 4 are T or F. The elements in the data cubes are data 3\The differences between double-connective association rule and database query are that, first, the query information in databases are predeterminate while the information to be mined by double-connective association rule is not predeterminate, it is implied. Secondly, database query needs to write SQL statements, while double-connective association rule mining is automatic. Thirdly, the information obtained by database query is quantitative, while the information obtained by double-connective association rule mining is qualitative such as “for many”, “there are some  REFERENCES 1 Ji a w ei H a n   M i ch eli n e K a m b er   D a t a  M i n i n g C onc ep t s  a nd Techniques, Higher Education Press, Beijing, 2001, Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, 2000 2 A  G  Ha m i lt on  L o gi c for M a th em a t i c ia ns R evi s ed E d i t i o n   Cambridge University Press, 1988, Tsinghua University Press Beijing, 2003 3 X unw e i Z h o u   Br ie f I ntr o du c t io n  to  Mu t u al l y I nve r s is tic Logic”, 1999 European Summer Meeting of the Association for Symbolic Logic, Utrecht, The Netherlands, August 1-6 1999 4 u n w ei Zh ou F i r s t leve l exp l i c i t m u lt ip le i ndu ct i v e composition”, 2005 Spring Meeting of the Association for Symbolic Logic, The Westin St. Francis Hotel, San Francisco CA.

support pruning gene expression classifier with an accurate and compact fuzzy rule base for microarray data analysis Biosystems vol 85 computationally challenging As training set sizes increase it is likely that these difficulties will also increase VI RELATED WORK While operating on a microarray dataset current CAR 1 2 3 4 and other pattern/rule 20 21 mining algorithms perform a pruned and/or compacted exponential search over either the space of gene subsets or the space of sample subsets Hence they are generally quite computationally expensive for datasets containing many training samples or genes as the case may be BSTC is explicitly related to CAR-based classifiers but requires no expensive CAR mining BSTC is also related to decision tree-based classifiers such as random forest 19 and C4.5 family 9 methods It is possible to represent any consistent set of boolean association rules as a decision tree and vice versa However it is generally unclear how the trees generated by current tree-based classifiers are related to high confidence/support CARs which are known to be particularly useful for microarray data 1 2 6 7 11 BSTC is explicitly related to and motivated by CAR-based methods To the best of our knowledge there is no previous work on mining/classifying with BARs of the form we consider here Perhaps the work closest to utilizing 100 BARs is the TOPRULES 22 miner TOP-RULES utilizes a data partitioning technique to compactly report itemlgene subsets which are unique to each class set Ci Hence TOP-RULES discovers all 100 confident CARs in a dataset However the method must utilize an emerging pattern mining algorithm such as MBD-LLBORDER 23 and so generally isn't polynomial time Also related to our BAR-based techniques are recent methods which mine gene expression training data for sets of fuzzy rules 24 25 Once obtained fuzzy rules can be used for classification in a manner analogous to CARs However the resulting fuzzy classifiers don't appear to be as accurate as standard classification methods such as SVM 25 VII CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK To address the computational difficulties involved with preclassification CAR mining see Tables IV and VI we developed a novel method which considers a larger subset of CAR-related boolean association rules BARs These rules can be compactly captured in a Boolean Structure Table BST which can then be used to produce a BST classifier called BSTC Comparison to the current leading CAR classifier RCBT on several benchmark microarray datasets shows that BSTC is competitive with RCBT's accuracy while avoiding the exponential costs incurred by CAR mining see Section VB Hence BSTC extends generalized CAR based methods to larger datasets then previously practical Furthermore unlike other association rule-based classifiers BSTC easily generalizes to multi-class gene expression datasets BSTC's worst case per-query classification time is worse then CAR-based methods after all exponential time CAR mining is completed O SlS CGl versus O Si CGi As future work we plan on investigating techniques to decrease this cost by carefully culling BST exclusion lists ACKNOWLEDGM[ENTS We thank Anthony K.H
