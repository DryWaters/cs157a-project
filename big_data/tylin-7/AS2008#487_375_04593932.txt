Network Security Data Mining Based on Wavelet Decomposition    Ming Meng Department of Economics & Management North China Electric Power University Baoding, Hebei 071003, China ncepumm@126.com      Project Supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China \(70671039\ and Scientific Research Foundation for Young Teachers, North China Electric Power University  Abstract The network log file database is important to security management. But, with the development of internet, it has become too bulkiness to be used directly. In this paper, the wavelet decomposition is adopted to mining the useful rules from the network security data. This is different from traditional data mining methods of association rules. Multi-resolution analysis of wavelet transform method is used to analyze and mine the data of network security log file database on different time scale. The period law of the attack number in different time domain is found by this method. These are important messages for taking relevant measures to insure network security   Index Terms - Discrete wavelet transform, Network log file database, Data mining, security management  I  I NTRODUCTION  With the expansion of internet, the network security log file database has greatly increased. Extracting useful information from tons of net security data will become more and more important. The continued growth in data collection of it ensures that the fundamental problem which knowledge discovery in databases \(KDD\ addresses, namely how does one understand and uses one's data, will continue to be of critical importance across a large number organizations Although simple statistical techniques and machine learning for data analysis were developed long ago, advance techniques for intelligent data analysis are not yet mature. KDD can be regarded as one of the prime function of data mining that is a new generation of information processing technology. Data mining involves fitting models to or determining pattern from observed data. The fitted models play the role of inferred knowledge. Deciding whether the model reflects useful knowledge or not is a part of the overall KDD process for which subjective human judgment is usually required Typically, a data-mining algorithm constitutes a model, a preference criterion, and a search algorithm. The more common model functions in data mining include classification, clustering, rule generation and knowledge discovery  Ariori algorithm [2   as t h e  r e p r e s e n t a t i v e o f tr ad i tio n a l  data mining ones, finds useful rules through processing frequent item sets. These methods canêt solve the problem of discovering knowledge from time serial data, such as network security one. Berndt and Warping [3  h a s  r e s e a r c h ed  h o w t o  get a similar time serial mode to the reference one. They realize this by a dynamic time curve method. Rafiei D. and Mendelzon A ha s f u r t h e r de v e l o p e d t i m e s e ri e s da t a  mining method by Fourier transform. This method can realize data dimensions reduction but it could only analysis the whole frequency characters in time axes, that is to say, it could not offer any local ones The wavelet transform is initiated by Morlet  i n 1980  when he analysis earthquake data. Mallat S G. [6 b r o u g h t  forward the concept of multi-resolution analysis to develop the wavelet theory in 1989. The merits of wavelet lie in its character of localization at time domain and frequency one Just because of this, the wavelet wins through the limitation of Fourier transform and named as math microscope. Under the researches of many experts, the wavelet theory has greatly evolved in latter years and new algorithms [8-10  ar e constantly brought forward The discrete wavelet transform \(DWT\, which is an orthonormal transform, re-expresses a time series in terms of coefficients that are associated with a particular time and with a particular band within a dyadic division of the frequency range. In this paper, we adopt DWT to mining the data of network security log file. It aims at offering a new idea for network security log file database mining II  T HE DWT  A LGORITHM  The Fourier transform gives the frequency information of the signal, but it does not tell us when in time these frequency components exist. The information provided by the integral corresponds to all time instances because the integration is done for all time intervals. It means that no matter where in time the frequency f appears, it will affect the result of the integration equally. This is why Fourier transform is not suitable for non-stationary signals The DWT is defined by the following expression  0 m,i 0 0 1 X   m m m n ina xn a a     1 In \(1 x  n d    r e fe r t o t h e d i gi t i z e d i n p u t s i gn a l a n d the discretized mother wavelet, respectively The DWT can be implemented by means of a filter bank such as the one shown in Figure 1 978-1-4244-2114-5/08/$25.00 © 2008 IEEE 6646 Proceedings of the 7th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation June 25 - 27, 2008, Chongqing, China 


    Fig. 1 The demonstration for discrete wavelet transform \(DWT In Figure 1, g and h are the impulse response of a suitable high-pass filter and of its dual low-pass filter, respectively Both the number and the value of the coefficients of each filter are characteristic of a given mother wavelet. These filters have three main characteristics: 1\ they are FIR filters; 2\ the sum of the coefficients of the high-pass filter is zero, whereas the sum of the coefficients of the low-pass filter is unity; 3\ the norm of both filters is one The application of a wavelet transform has the effect of decomposing a time-based signal f  t just as network security log file data one, into frequencies that are localised in time 11  A t ime s e r i e s c a n b e d e c o mp o s e d in to  a s e t o f w a v e l e t coefficients W  t 0  s here t 0 is a point in the time series and s is a characteristic frequency scale. The amplitude of the wavelet coefficient gives the measure of the energy in the signal at a particular time of a particular frequency. Growth and decay rates of these frequencies, corresponding to the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues, can therefore be estimated from the rate of changes of W  t 0  s with respect to time, see below. For the kernel of the transform a wavelet g  t  s s chosen which, for a fixed value of s, gives a simple shape and structure of the type of function into which the time series is to be decomposed. A commonly used wavelet transform is the Morlet wavelet \(Healey, 1995; Farge, 1992\ given by 2    exp    2 gts st imst   2 This wavelet is an oscillation with a Gaussian modulation and as such resembles a wave packet. The parameter m determines the number of oscillatory cycles in the packet. For a fixed s the wavelet is translated by t 0 then projected onto f  t  by 0  0  Wt s s ftgt tsdt     3 where the s factor normalises the energies in each scale. It is observed that the integral on the right-hand side is a convolution operation between f  t nd g  t  s So if we take the Fourier transforms of these   it Fftedt        4   it Gs gtsedt        5 and let H    s  F    G    s then the wavelet transform becomes 0 0   2 it s Wt s H se d        6 An example given by Healey \(1995\oncerns the time series 11 212 32 sin  exp   sin  sin  exp  ct ttt ft c t t t t ct ttt            7 where  0.15  0:015 and the constants c n are chosen to ensure that f  t is continuous The central unmodulated section of \(7\ is picked out easily and the amplitude increases and decreases either side Leakage into other frequencies is due to the compact nature of wavelets, but leakage is seen to increase near to t 1 and t 2 where discontinuities exist in the first derivatives. The essential part of this method is that the real part of the complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues  i  can be estimated from the rate of change of amplitude of the frequency  at a particular moment in time by 1   ln  Wt s ts Wts        012 8 where again  is the sample time. This is in effect fitting an exponential function to the wavelet transform over a specified interval at a certain frequency Sometimes eigenvalues in the form of exponential growth or decay coefficients in the çzeroé frequency components corresponding to real eigenvalues, are required. In many cases though it is not possible to resolve W  t 0  s below a certain frequency dependent on the duration of the time series. In such cases it is better to extract such eigenvalues directly from the raw waveform by fitting exponential functions to appropriate intervals near to the fixed point of interest. It should be borne in mind that in some cases the time series will grow from or decay to some value or offset other than zero We now turn our attention back to the parameter m which appears in \(2\, and gives the number of oscillatory cycles within the Gaussian envelope represented by \(2\ During studies of this method it was noticed that the wavelet transform function W  t 0  s is less able to resolve frequency when m is low. To determine an acceptable minimum value for m an expression of the form f  t exp at 2 os bnt as examined using the wavelet transform method. For this study we set the parameters to a 0.01 and b 0.14 which renders n a good approximation of the number of cycles visible in the Gaussian envelope. In other words, the parameters a and b  were chosen so that the number of cycles seen in the graph by someone not knowing the expression for f  t is n. The parameter m was varied at discrete values between 1 and 5 inclusively while maintaining n  m  It was noticed that for n  m 4 there is significant leakage into higher frequencies. Indeed for n  m 2 this leakage extended as far as the Nyquist frequency. Only for n  m 4 does the modulated frequency become satisfactorily resolved Therefore this method is best employed where isolated bursts contain at least four cycles. For the analysis of time series with bursts containing less than four cycles it is almost certainly necessary to resort to phase space techniques. Indeed Healey 6647 


1991\u cceeded in estimating eigenvalues from sub-cycle Silnikov spiralling When m  n then the corresponding wavelet is poorly resolved in the frequency domain but is more localised in the time domain. On the other hand when m  n we find that the wavelet spreads out over the time domain but is better resolved in terms of frequency. This shows the importance of matching m correctly to n in a particular time series. We find that good resolution of the wavelet is acceptable when m is within about 20% of n  By using DWT, we could get the signalês frequency information characters of any resolutions. That is to say, it could elicit useful information from anfractuous signals III  T HE DWT  D ATA M INING  Web servers are often be attacked from outside. With the increasing of web users, the net security log file database has greatly expanded.  The 24-hour attack number to an opening net server system has exceeded 3◊10 6 shown as follows\. The security log file is very important to ensure net safety, find net bugs and surveil hacker intrusions. But many security log file databases are left unused just because its bulkiness nowadays In this paper, we select a web server as the research object and record the attack number of each 15 minutes from 0:00 to 24:00. Continual 28 days \(the first day is Monday record data is selected to wavelet decomposition \(Fig. 2\. We now just analyz  the numbers of possible malicious attack   try to find its rules here  Fig. 2 Raw data of attack number Here we adopt Morlet wavelet function \(introduced before\ to discompose historical security data. Although there only 28daysê historical data are selected to analysis, the continuous 2688 data points \(Fig. 2\ are too clutter to tell us any useful rules of attack  he different layer discompose results could tell us many useful information From the similar vector of third layer \(Fig. 3\, we can clear find that each day have two attack number peaks. For most days, the second peak is higher than the first one  Fig. 3 The similar vectors of third layer In order to further observe, we se lect the second 1/4 of the third layerês similar vector to demonstrate. It is shown in Fig. 4  Fig 4 The first 1/4 of third layerês similar vector Compared to the raw data, we can conclude  useful attack number rules. They are listed as follows  TABLE I O NE OF THE W AVELET D ATA M INING R ESULTS   T HE DAILY A TTACK RULE  First peak Second peak First valley Second valley 2:00 21:00 14:00 22:30 Other layer discompose results could tell us other information. Such as the fifth similar vector \(Fig. 5\, which clearly tell us that the attack numbers is similar from Monday to Thursday. The attack number of Sunday is much more than usual and less than Friday. The attack number of Saturday is the most  Fig. 5 The similar vectors of fifth layer From the decompose result, we can easily find many useful laws. According to this, many measures will be taken in practical network security management. Further more, other attack characters could also be analyzed by the same method and other useful laws will be finding IV  C ONCLUSIONS  6648

Used-for references in the LCSH into holonym/meronym relations in our WKB  In the experiments we assume that each topic comes from an individual user We attempt to evaluate our model in an environment that covers great range of topics However it is not realistic to expect a participant to hold such great range of topics in personal interests Thus for the 50 experimental topics we assume each one coming from an individual user and learn her his personalized ontology An LIR is collected through searching the subject catalogue of Queensland University of Technology QUT Library 3 by using the title of a topic Librarians have assigned title table of content summary and a list of subjects to each information item e.g a book stored in QUT library The assigned subjects are treated as the tags in Web documents that cite the knowledge in the WKB  In order to simplify the experiments we only use the librarian summarized information title table of content and summary to represent an instance in an LIR  All these information can be downloaded from QUT's Web site and are available to the public Once the WKB and an LIR are ready an ontology is learned as described in Section 3.3.1 and personalized as in Section 3.3.2 The user con\002dence rates on the subjects are speci\002ed as in Section 3.3.3 A document d i in the training set is then generated by an instance i  and its support value is determined by support  d i   X s 2 021  i  s 2S sup  s Q  14 where s 2 S in O  Q  are as de\002ned in De\002nition 5 As sup  s Q   0 for s 2 S 000 according to Eq 11 the documents with support  d   0 go to D 000  whereas those with support  d   0 go to D   4.4 Performance Measures The performance of the experimental models are measured by three methods the precision averages at eleven standard recall levels 11SPR the mean average precision MAP and the F 1 Measure They are all based on precision and recall the modern IR evaluation methods The 11SPR is reported suitable for information gathering and is used in TREC evaluations as a performance measuring standard An 11SPR v alue is computed by summing the interpolated precisions at the speci\002ed recall cutoff and then dividing by the number of topics P N i 1 precision 025 N  025  f 0  0  0  1  0  2      1  0 g  15 N is the number of topics and 025 are the cutoff points where the precisions are interpolated At each 025 point an aver3 http://library.qut.edu.au Figure 2 Experimental 11SPR Results age precision value over N topics is calculated These average precisions then link to a curve describing the recallprecision performance The MAP is a stable and discriminating choice in information gathering evaluations and is recommended for measuring general-purpose information gathering methods The average precision for each topic is the mean of the precision obtained after each relevant document is retrieved The MAP for the 50 experimental topics is then the mean of the average precision scores of each of the individual topics in the experiments The MAP re\003ects the performance in a non-interpolated recall-precision fashion F 1 Measure is also well accepted by the information gathering community which is calculated by F 1  2 002 precision 002 recall precision  recall  16 Precision and recall are evenly weighted in F 1 Measure For each topic the macro F 1 Measure averages the precision and recall and then calculates F 1 Measure whereas the micro F 1 Measure calculates the F 1 Measure for each returned result and then averages the F 1 Measure values The greater F 1 values indicate the better performance 5 Results and Discussions The experiments attempt to evaluate our proposed model by comparing to an implementation of mental model We expect that the ONTO model can achieve at least the close performance to the TREC model The experimental 11SPR results are illustrated in Fig 2 At recall point 0.3 the TREC model slightly outperformed the ONTO model but at 0.5 and 0.6 the ONTO model achieved better results than the TREC model subtly At all other points their 11SPR results are just the same For the MAP results shown on Table 1 the ONTO model achieved 0.284 which is just 0.006 below the TREC model 2

TREC ONTO p-value Macro-FM 0.388 0.386 0.862 Micro-FM 0.356 0.355 0.896 MAP 0.290 0.284 0.484 Table 1 Other Experimental results downgrade For the average macroand microF 1 Measures also shown on Table 1 the TREC model only outperformed the ONTO model by 0.002 0.5 in macro F 1 and 0.001 0.2 in micro F 1  The two models achieved almost the same performance The evaluation result is promising The statistical test is also performed on the experimental results in order to analyze the evaluation's reliability As suggested by we use the Student's Paired T-Test for the signi\002cance test The null hypothesis in our T-Test is that no difference exists in two comparing models When two tests produce substantially low p-value usually  0.05 the null hypothesis can be rejected In contrast when two tests produce high p-value usually  0.1 there is not or just little practical difference between two models The T-Test results are also presented on Table 1 The pvalue s show that there is no evidence of signi\002cant difference between two experimental models as the produced pvalue s are quite high  p-value 0.484\(MAP 0.862\(macroFM and 0.896\(micro-FM far greater than 0.1 Thus we can conclude that in terms of statistics our proposed model has the same performance as the golden TREC model and the evaluation result is reliable The advantage of the TREC model is that the experimental topics and the training sets are generated by the same linguists manually They as users perfectly know their information needs and what they are looking for in the training sets Therefore it is reasonable that the TREC model performed better than the ONTO model as we cannot expect that a computational model could outperform a such perfect manual model However the knowledge contained in TREC model's training sets is well formed for human beings to understand but not for computers The contained knowledge is not mathematically formalized and speci\002ed The ONTO model on the other hand formally speci\002es the user background knowledge and the related semantic relations using the world knowledge base and local instance repositories The mathematic formalizations are ideal for computers to understand This leverages the performance of the ONTO model As a result as shown on Fig 2 and Table 1 the ONTO model achieved almost the same performance as that of the TREC model 6 Conclusions In this paper an ontology-based knowledge IR framework is proposed aiming to discover a user's background knowledge to improve IR performance The framework consists of a user's mental model a querying model a computer model and an ontology model A world knowledge base is used by the computer model to construct an ontology to simulate a user's mental model and the ontology is personalized by using the user's local instance repository The semantic relations of hypernym/hyponym holonym/meronym and synonym are speci\002ed in the ontology model The framework is successfully evaluated by comparing to a manual user model The ontology-based framework is a novel contribution to knowledge engineering and Web information retrieval References   C Buckley and E M Voorhees Evaluating evaluation measure

support pruning gene expression classifier with an accurate and compact fuzzy rule base for microarray data analysis Biosystems vol 85 computationally challenging As training set sizes increase it is likely that these difficulties will also increase VI RELATED WORK While operating on a microarray dataset current CAR 1 2 3 4 and other pattern/rule 20 21 mining algorithms perform a pruned and/or compacted exponential search over either the space of gene subsets or the space of sample subsets Hence they are generally quite computationally expensive for datasets containing many training samples or genes as the case may be BSTC is explicitly related to CAR-based classifiers but requires no expensive CAR mining BSTC is also related to decision tree-based classifiers such as random forest 19 and C4.5 family 9 methods It is possible to represent any consistent set of boolean association rules as a decision tree and vice versa However it is generally unclear how the trees generated by current tree-based classifiers are related to high confidence/support CARs which are known to be particularly useful for microarray data 1 2 6 7 11 BSTC is explicitly related to and motivated by CAR-based methods To the best of our knowledge there is no previous work on mining/classifying with BARs of the form we consider here Perhaps the work closest to utilizing 100 BARs is the TOPRULES 22 miner TOP-RULES utilizes a data partitioning technique to compactly report itemlgene subsets which are unique to each class set Ci Hence TOP-RULES discovers all 100 confident CARs in a dataset However the method must utilize an emerging pattern mining algorithm such as MBD-LLBORDER 23 and so generally isn't polynomial time Also related to our BAR-based techniques are recent methods which mine gene expression training data for sets of fuzzy rules 24 25 Once obtained fuzzy rules can be used for classification in a manner analogous to CARs However the resulting fuzzy classifiers don't appear to be as accurate as standard classification methods such as SVM 25 VII CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK To address the computational difficulties involved with preclassification CAR mining see Tables IV and VI we developed a novel method which considers a larger subset of CAR-related boolean association rules BARs These rules can be compactly captured in a Boolean Structure Table BST which can then be used to produce a BST classifier called BSTC Comparison to the current leading CAR classifier RCBT on several benchmark microarray datasets shows that BSTC is competitive with RCBT's accuracy while avoiding the exponential costs incurred by CAR mining see Section VB Hence BSTC extends generalized CAR based methods to larger datasets then previously practical Furthermore unlike other association rule-based classifiers BSTC easily generalizes to multi-class gene expression datasets BSTC's worst case per-query classification time is worse then CAR-based methods after all exponential time CAR mining is completed O SlS CGl versus O Si CGi As future work we plan on investigating techniques to decrease this cost by carefully culling BST exclusion lists ACKNOWLEDGM[ENTS We thank Anthony K.H
