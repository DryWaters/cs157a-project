Rough Set Page Recommendation Algorithm Based on Information Entropy    XIONG Haijun 1 ZHANG Qi 2 and WANG Baoyi 1  1 School of Computer Science & Technology 2 School of Science & Technology North China Electric Power University Baoding,China xionghaijun,superland_163}@163.com ,wangbaoyi@126.com   Abstract In order to solve the accuracy and speed problems of page recommendation, we used information entropy of data in positive domain to help finding out the rough set rules. A new rough set important attribute mining algorithm based on information entropy is put forward in this paper, according to which a heuristic rules mining algorithm of web page recommendation is designed. At last we used the recommendation rules to help web users to find out pages which are interested to them. The experiment results show that the algorithm can improve speed and accuracy of web page recommendation Keywords-rough set; page recommendation;Information Entropy;rule mining I   I NTRODUCTION  With the development of web technology, web pages are on the rise. How to find useful information from mass of pages is an important challenge. Web log analysis is widely used in mining web usage patterns, including statistical analysis frequency analysis of page views, classification method based on neural network [1 nd i n g o u t co mm o n a c c e ss pa t h  2  mining of association rules [3,4  an d s o  on  M o s t  of t h e d a t a  mining algorithms deal with raw web log data directly [5   b u t  log data is often incomplete and there are many uncertainties 6  s o th e ru l e s f o u n d  ou t f r o m th es e d a ta a r e n o t s o a ccu r a t e   Z. Pawlak put forward rough set theory to address uncertainty of data in 1982, [7 O u r  r u l e s m i ni ng a l gor i t h m i s  based on rough set, so that it could effectively solve the uncertainty  of web page recommendation rules. With the development of rough set theory, more and more people began to use rough set to reduce attributes and discover rules. People want to find the best attribute reduction [8 Ho w e ve r Wong.SKM and Ziarko.W have proved that it is a NP-hard problem, which leading to NP-hard problem is mainly due to an explosion combination of attributes, therefore there is no efficient attribute reduction algorithm. It makes rules mining slowly and can not achieve the speed requirements of real time web page recommendation. Klemttinen introduced the concept of template rules, and pointed out that this method can better identify the requirements of the association rules and the implementation of cooperation recommendation. It is found that this method of mining rules from a large number of data has higher time complexity [9, 10   To  so lv e  rea l tim e w e b s ite  recommendation speed, this paper proposed a rapid important attribute discovery algorithm based on rough set and information entropy. The algorithm reduce attributes of the web log firstly, according to which, a heuristic rules mining algorithm  of web page recommended is put forward then, it can recommend web pages to the current session at last II  W EB PAGE RECOMMENDATION MODEL   As Fig. 1 showing, the rough set based web page recommendation system is divided into offline module and online module. The main task of offline processing stage is to decompose the web log click flow, reduce attributes, and find rules from web log. For online processing stage, the module decomposes the web log click flow from the current session matches the current session with the recommendation rules and puts forward a personalized recommendation set. At the same time, the results of a recommendation influence the current page and the coming ones  III  A TTRIBUTE REDUCTION   A  Log Pretreatment All web visiting information is often record in Web logs but only the time an user spend on a page can show the user’s interests. We take relevant pages on the website as attributes and take the time the user spend on the page as the attribute value of the decision table, the  decision attributes are dynamically assigned  This work is supported by the Teacher’s Research Foundation of North China Electric Power University \(200711031 web log log pretreatment   attributes reduction rule mining  matching recommendation recommendation set Figure 1.

The record time of the visiting in web log is on the point view of server issue, which is not accurate. The less of precision is manifested in the differences between the times of transmission process. An integrity process of an user request A and B is like this: A user request page A \(T1\, the server receipt of the request \(T2\, the server response to the request \(T3\, the client receive the response \(T4\, client request page B\(T5\ the server receive the request \(T6\, then the time the user stay on the page A is appear as T2-T6, but actually it’s T4-T5. The time the users spend on page A is as the following description   T5 T6 T2 T4 T2 T6 1 After further refinement of the time, the time element being measured by the number of minutes, so the decision table can be expressed as follows T ABLE 1  R AW DECISION TABLE  P1 P2 P3 P4 P5 1 2 0 2 1 0 1 0 1 2 B  Attribute Importance Weight Based on Information Entropy  Given the shortcomings of condition entropy when used to describe attribute importance, we take the information entropy of data in positive domain as a metric when considering on attribute importance. The method is good eno ugh to avoid over characterization of the border elements. The importance of attributes is given as follows C is the condition set of attributes in decision table T, a subset of attributes A 002 C, the attribute importance of the subset is defined as  H*\(A\H\(D|A SGF*\(A,D\1 logN 2 In formula \(2\ is the number of objects in decision table T and H*\(A\efined as follows  1     log     n iiiA i H ApXpXXPOSD   002 000  3 Set T = <U,R,V,f> is the decision making system, in which R=C 000 D, C is the condition attributes set, D is the decision attributes set, a subset of attributes A 003 C, a is the arbitrary attribute and a 004 C\\A. The importance of attribute set A relative to decision making attribute set D is defined as       a          D A SGF D A SGF D A a SGF  005   4 Table T is as follows T ABLE 2  D ECISION TABLE T U p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 p6 p7 p8 a 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 b 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 d 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0  According to formula \(4\e importance of attribute a and b are calculated as follows SGF*\(a,A,D\GF*\(\(a\0=0.40 SGF*\(b,A,D\GF*\(\(b\0=0.14 We can see from the result above that by improving the method of importance measurement the result is in line with the actual situation. In the above example, almost half of the elements are in the border domain. So when most elements are in the border domain, the approach based on mutual information to measurement will over characterizes the elements in the border domain, The method based on information entropy takes the number of domain elements and their distribution into account, and which can get a reasonable degree of the importance of attributes C  Attribute Reduction  Before the algorithm is given, let us first think about the concept of the core attributes set C and D, which are equivalence relations of U; C positive domain of D is recorded as pos C D\ namely          D U Y Y X X D pos i i j C U x j c j 004 002  004 000  5 For U / C classification, the positive domain of U / D is the object collection which can be classified by the knowledge in U C expression C and D are the equivalence relations of U, when pos ind\(C ind\(D\=pos ind 002 C-{r 002 ind\(D\\, we take r 001\031 C of C as the relation which can be omitted in relation to D. Otherwise, r in C can not be omitted in relation to D When each r in C can not be omitted in relation to D, we claimed C and D independent. When S 003 C, and pos S D\pos C D\he group S known as the reduction of C in relation to D, and recorded as red D C All of the original groups in C which can not be omitted in relation to D are known as the core of C in relation to D, the formula is as follows CORED\(C 000\037 redD\(C 6 With the definition of property based on information entropy below, now we can put forward the attribute reduction algorithm based on information entropy, since the definition of attribute core is given Because there is a core attribute set C CORE D C\, the algorithm can deal with attributes in a gradual increase way and use  SGF*\(a,A,D\ as an inspiration , until the important degree of attributes is no longer increase, then we achieve the relative reduction. The algorithm is as follows

Decision matrix is defined as follows Information systems T = \(U, A, V, f\, in which U is the domain, attribute set A = C 001 D, C is conditions set, D is decision attribute set. The equivalent relations in C are C1 C2,…, Cm, given a concept c 001\031 C1, C2,…, Cm\e concept belongs to c and the concepts do not belongs to c has different subscript, which are i \(i = 1,2 002\026 nd j \(j = 1,2 002 he matrix of  concept c in T is defined as M c T\M ij which is a 002\026   002 matrix. The value of each element in the matrix is as follows M ij i 000 a\(j 002 i=1,2 002\026 j=1,2 002  7 In the above formula, a\(i\s the value of an attribute For each of the object in concept c, i\(i=1,2 002\026 we can calculate the shortest length of rules    c iij j B M 007 010    8 The sign 001 and 001 are extended operators, the final decision-making rules of concept c can be set into the following formula   c i RULEc=|B i=1,2  011 9 B  Rule Mining Algorithm  There is a lot of noise in the data, so that the confidence of a rule is not necessarily to be 1, it is necessary to deal decision matrix with confidence. The confidence of concept c in decision matrix is as follows Confidence of concept c in decision matrix All the 002\025 positive domain  C P OS D 012 d 002\025 negative domain  C P OS D 012 g to concept c has respectively subscript i \(i = 1,2 002\026 j = 1,2 002 he decision matrix is defined as  013 014  2  1   2  1            015  j i j a i a i a a M certain ij  10 Therefore, the ultimate decision making rules of concept c can be expressed as the follows    2  1      014  010 007   i M B RULE certain ij certain i certain i 11 With the definition of decision making rules, the following steps are based on the decision matrix Step 1: Calculate the division of the condition attributes set C and decision attributes set D in relation to the decision table respectively,  {C 1 002 C 2 C n and{D 1 D 2 D m  Step 2: Calculate  C P OS D 012 and  C N EG D 012  Step 3: Calculated decision matrix certain ij M  Step 4: According to the decision making matrix, mining decision making rules and find out its reduction In order to better explain the operation of algorithm steps the illustrate with an example is given below With the following information table T ABLE 3  I NFORMATION TABLE T P1 P2 P4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 1 1 2 0 1 0 0 0 2 1 The divisions in table T are as follows U/INP4\({p1,p2}\2},{3,6},{4},{5 U/INP4\({p4}\2,4,5},{3,6

Because of the above information form for compatibility information table 002\025 positive domain has the degree of support of all the rules are for 1 When p4 = 0, {p1, p2} have the positive domain of {{1,2 4}, {5\ and has a negative domain {3,6} relative to {p4 Therefore M 00 p2,2 M 10 p1,0 M 20 p1,0\,\(p2,2 Rules are as follows 002  p2=0 000 p4=0,\( support =1 p1=1 000 p4=0,\( support =1 When p4 = 1, {p1, p2} has the negative domain of {{1, 2 4}, {5\d has the positive domain of {3,6} relative to p4 Therefore M 00 p2,0 M 01 p1,1 M 02 p1,1\,\(p2,0 Rules are as follows 002 p2=0 007 p1=1 007  p1=1 010 p2=2 000 p4=1 After reduction, we can get p2=0 007 p1=1 000 p4=1,\( support =1 Thus we obtained the greatest general of all the rules. The difference between objects in positive domain and objects in negative domain is described by decision matrix. We can identify the most general rule with the logical way and we can get the greatest general of all the rules. At the same time, we can do it with the introduction of variable accuracy of rough set, and with confidence to describe the probability of conflict of rules, which can play a good role in the suppression of noise On a higher precision require, we need simply modify the value of 002\025 smaller V  P AGE RECOMMENDATION EXPERIMENT   To apply our method to practical work, we designed software used for inference rules reasoning and the implementation of real time recommendation. To illustrate the Effectiveness of the algorithm based on information entropy and rough set \(IER\e used NASA, C. NET and UOS data to verify the algorithm; we value the effectiveness of the approach with the similarity between the recommendation set and the click flow. In order to show the effectiveness of our algorithm better, we compare it with MFP and TOP-N algorithm, and the results are shown in the table below T ABLE 4  T ESTING R ESULTS  Alg Data TOP-N MF P IER NASA 82.25 80.6 3 82.67 C.NET 78.72 70 77.86 UOS 70.76 72.0 5 73.14  From above results, we can see that IER method has higher performance on the recommendation of precision in NASA and UOS data set, and in C. NET data set, the performance of the algorithm is no better than  TOP-N. Overall the performance of IER algorithm comes from different data sets is relative stability and the accuracy of recommendation is satisfactory VI  C ONCLUSION   We use visiting time to describe paths, which can more accurately describe user's interest. In our model, we first pretreated the web log and then do attribute reduction with the support of the information entropy theory. Our approach reduces the amount of computation; thereby it can speed up the rate of discovery rules. Experiment result proved that information entropy based personalized recommendation algorithm can excavate more meaningful rules. In order to guarantee the accuracy of the recommendation, the new path recommended by the system will participate in the next circle The system is cold start, which need further study and solution R EFERENCES   1  Hahn-Ming Lee, Chih-Ming Chen and Yung-Feng Lu,“A Selforganizing HCMAC Neural Network Classifier,” IEEE Transaction on Neural Networks,vol. 14, no. 1, 2003,15-27 2  Hwanjo Yu, Jiawei Han,etc.” PEBL: Web Page Classification without Negative Examples”, IEEE  TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING, VOL. 16, NO. 1, JANUARY 2004,7081 3  Li, J., Tang, B., Cercone, N.: Applying Association Rules for Interesting Recommendations Using Rule Templates.

Figure 3\(a one can see that our technique for both q  0 and q  1 reached a gain in precision up to 5 in comparison with the original features and the features selected by the StARMiner without weighting Figure 3\(b shows that our technique presented a gain in precision of approximately 14 at 45 of recall in comparison with the precision obtained using the original featues and the features selected by StARMiner Figure 3\(c shows a gain in precision up to 16 at 35 of recall using q  0  where the feature vector size was reduced in 27 Figure 4 shows an example of a k NN  k 8 query execution using the top left image as the center of query Figure 4\(a shows the result using the original features and Figure 4\(b shows the result using our proposed method with q  0 fewer features The images highlighted by a dashed line means false positive images A false positive image is a returned image whose class differs from the class of the query center Clearly an improvement on the results was reached by applying our method Considering the results achieved we argue that our proposed weighting technique is well-suited to perform continuous feature selection in content-based medical images improving the precision of them An important fact to stand out is that our weighting technique can be applied to other distance functions too Figure 4 An example of k NN  k 8 query execution using the top left image as the center of query a using the original features b using our proposed method with q  0  The images wrapped by a dashed line means false positives images 5 Conclusions In this paper we presented a supervised method of continuous feature selection The proposed method employs statistical association rules to reduce the semantic gap inherent in the CBIR systems Our approach can also be employed to perform dimensionality reduction minimizing the dimensionality curse problem The experiments performed show that the proposed method improves the precision of the query results up to 38 always outperforming the precision obtained by the original features while decreasing the memory and processing costs These results testify that statistical association rules can be successfully employed to perform continuous feature selection in medical image databases weighting the features in similarity query executions Future work includes to verify the results of applying our technique using other distance functions and incorporating other mining techniques References  R Agra w al and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In Intl Conf on Very Large Databases  pages 487–499 Santiago de Chile Chile 1994  R A Baeza-Y ates and B Ribeiro-Neto Modern Information Retrieval  Addison-Wesley Longman Publishing Co Inc Boston MA USA 1999  A G R Balan A J M T raina and P  M d A Marques Fractal analysis of image textures for indexing and retrieval by content In 18th IEEE Intl Symposium on ComputerBased Medical Systems  pages 56–63 Dublin Ireland 2005  R M  Haralick K Shanmug am and I Dinstein T e xtural features for image classi\002cation IEEE Transactions on Systems Man and Cybernetics  3:610–621 1973  M Malcok Y  Aslandog an and A Y esildirek Fractal dimension and similarity search in high-dimensional spatial databases In IEEE Intl Conf on Information Reuse and Integration  pages 380–384 Waikoloa Hawaii USA 2006  C Ordonez N Ezquerra and C A Santana Constraining and summarizing association rules in medical data Knowledge and Information Systems  9\(3 2006  H P an J Li and Z W ei Mining interesting association rules in medical images In Advance Data Mining and Medical Applications  pages 598–609 Springer Verlag 2005  P  Perner  Image mining issu es frame w ork a gener ic tool and its application to medical-image diagnosis Engineering Applications of Arti\002cial Intelligence  15\(2 2002  M X Ribeiro A G R Balan J C Felipe A J M T raina and C Traina Jr Mining statistical association rules to select the most relevant medical image features In 1st Intl Workshop on Mining Complex Data  pages 91–98 Houston USA 2005  J T raina Caetano A J M T raina C F aloutsos and B Seeger Fast indexing and visualization of metric datasets using slim-trees IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering  14\(2 2002  D R W ilson and T  R Martinez Impro v ed heterogeneous distance functions Journal of Arti\002cial Intelligence Research  6:1–34 1997 Morgan Kaufmann Publishers

Figure 3 Low conÞdence and low p-value statistical tests As suc h by comparing the e\002ect of these two we can better understand the di\002erence between these two techniques Let us rst observe the case when constrained association rules deems a pair as having low con“dence while OLAP statistical tests labels the same pair with a high p-value One such pair is as follows CLAUDI 0/1 006 RCA In this case the association rule pair is composed of two individual rules The rule CLAUDI=0 006 RCAlow has a con“dence of 0.591 while the rule CLAUDI=1 006 RCAhigh only has a con“dence of 0.131 For the same pair OLAP statistical tests nds a p-value below 0.01 In order to study this case in detail we must look at a breakdown of the RCA values within the dataset separated by the two populations as shown in Figure 3 We can see that for the population with CLAUDI=0 the distribution of RCA values is clearly skewed toward the lower end However the distribution is more even for the other group For con“dence we must separate these values into low or high and with a threshold of 50 more RCA values are placed into the low basket than the high basket As a result the con“dence for the rule stating that CLAUDI=1 results in a high RCA is met with low con“dence The reliability of such results is questionable because the middle spike is close to the boundary point If the spike had been ve units higher then we would have a high con“dence The p-value is able to avoid such situations because it observes the entire spectrum of RCA values as a whole Thus it does not have distinct boundaries and is able to see that the average RCA value is significantly higher with CLAUDI=1 than CLAUDI=0 Let us now observe the opposite case where constrained association rule nds a pair to have high con“dence while OLAP statistical tests nds the same pair as having too high of a p-value One such pair is highchol=0/1,hyplpd=1,gender=0,smoke=0 006 RCA In this case both association rules that make up this pair have high con“dences but the p-value is 0.023 which is above 0.01 As before we will analyze a breakdown of RCA with respect to the two populations as shown in Figure 4 We can observe that the population with highchol=0 is heavily skewed toward the low end Figure 4 High conÞdence and high p-value of RCA while the population with highchol=1 is more evenly distributed The main di\002erence between the con“dence and p-value is again in how t he con“dence separates its values into distinct bins In this case more of the values of the second population is placed into the high RCA basket resulting in a high con“dence However when we observe the entire spectrum as a whole the average RCA value for highchol=1 is quite close to that for highchol=0 Through these two example s we can see that there are advantages and disadvantages to each technique For con“dence it is very fast because it only uses simple counts and is considered easier to understand On the other hand the concept of p-value and Gaussian distributions are more di\003cult to grasp but provides a strong statistical background Con“dence is not robust toward minor shifts in the values or random noise while the p-value is more accepta ble of such situations As the two examples above show if the values had been shifted only a few units then both pairs would have been deemed acceptable as opposed to only one Also in both cases the p-value proves to be reliable because it does not need to discretized the artery values 5 Related Work Association rules h as b een used in the m edical domain on many things including proteins 14  d r u g s 4  genetic data 2  a n d on d i sease p red i ct i o n  12  1 3   I n these works the authors often observed the rules individually and made their conclusions based on each rule The idea of grouping association rules together to discover information that would otherwise be hidden was explored in 8 The a utho r s used O L AP o p er a t io ns to group association rules together and explored the context information provided by such grouping Our extensions for association r ule is di\002erent because we analyze pairs of rules to nd trigger factors for the consequents Instead of nding global context information our nds approach rule context from a speci“c view point to nd single factors Constraints have been applied to OLAP in several

articles In   t h e au t h ors i n t ro d u c e d om ai n c on straints to OLAP in the form of a constraint language The authors of 7 p r o p o se using i n t eg r i t y co nstr a i n t s to determine whether speci“c aggregate view in OLAP can be obtained from various other views While both of these papers deal with constraints on OLAP the constraints on our OLAP statistical test are quite di\002erent from either the domain or the integrity constraint Unlike domain constraints our approach does not require a special language and can in stead be executed directly in any DBMS The depth and group constraints do not just help improve the performance of the algorithm but also reduces the size of the results 6 Conclusions In this article we presen ted a comparison between constrained association rules and OLAP statistical test We extended both algorithms with di\002erent features to bring the results to the same level For association rules we included a pairing procedure that enabled us to gain knowledge from a pair of rules that would otherwise be hidden In OLAP statistical test we included constraints to reduce the size of the results and to increase its performance These changes were di\003cult to implemented but helps to make the two techniques produce similar results so that we can analyze them side by side In our experiments we discovered that OLAP statistical t ests not only discover more pairs than constrained association rule the p-value is also more reliable than con“dence Small changes in the distribution of a pair can have profoundly di\002erent results for association rules because the shift might have been enough to push certain values into a di\002erent bin On the other hand p-value is not a\002ected by the same small shifts The decision of which technique to use ultimately becomes a question of con“dence versus p-value We nd that con“dences are better used when performance is a priority and the dataset is heavily skewed On the other hand p-values handle even distributions better than con“dence and also boasts comparable performance times For future work we want to analyze both techniques on more datasets that have more variations in dimensions and cardinality The relationship between lift and p-value should be analyzed We want to breakdown the mechanisms of both techniques and observe which are common between the two and which are unique Constrained association rule c an be extended further with a transaction precomputation to make it more robust toward larger cardinalities We also want to see if association rules can be alter ed to calculate p-value References  R  A gra w al T  I mielin sk i an d A  S w a mi M in in g a ssociation rules between sets of items in large databases In ACM SIGMOD
