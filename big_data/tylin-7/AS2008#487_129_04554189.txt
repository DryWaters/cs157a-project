Introduction  Intelligent transportation systems \(ITS\compass a broad range of wireless and wire line communicationsbased information and electronics technologies Intelligent transportation system \(ITS\a most promising method in dealing with the traffic problem  One of the key problems of intelligent transportation system is the analysis and management of traffic information. Some obvious information is obtained easily though traditional query operati on from traffic database but deeper information that hides in the traffic database is difficult to be discovered. Deep level information usually contains characteristics of data and forecast information of data development tendency Data mining currently is hot topic research area and is applied in database, artificial intelligence, statistics, and so on. It may discover valuable knowledge and the patterns in the large-scale database for users  2. Data mining method  The analytical techniques used in data mining are often well-known mathematical algorithms and techniques What is new is the application of those techniques to general business problems made possible by the increased availability of data and inexpensive storage and processing power. Also, the use of graphical interfaces has led to tools becoming available that business experts can easily use. Some of the tools used for data mining are    1\ Artificial neural networks.

Association rules mining  Association rule mining finds interesting associations and/or correlation relationships among large set of data items. Association rules show attributes value conditions that occur frequently together in a given dataset Association rules identify collections of data attributes that are statistically related in the underlying data. An association rule is of the form X => Y where X and Y are disjoint conjunctions of attribute-value pairs. The confidence of the rule is the conditional probability of Y given X, Pr\(Y|X\he support of the rule is the prior probability of X and Y, Pr\(X and Y\Here probability is taken to be the observed frequency in the data set. The traditional association rule mining problem can be described as follows. Given a database of transactions, a minimal confidence threshold and a minimal support threshold, find all association rules whose confidence and support are above the corresponding thresholds The steps of association rules mining based on data cube as follows Step1 mining frequent item-set which satisfies the minimum support on data cube Step2 association rules of frequent item-set are generated

4. Intelligent transportation systems application  In the ITS, violating regulation information, driver information and vehicle information are quite tedious This original data is difficult to mine out the effective patterns. Data selection a nd cleaning are first. Then integrate the data, process data and start mining. Finally the patterns that are mined out are evaluated. Mining process as shown in Fig .1   Fig .1 Mining process  The frequent patterns are obtained by mining nearly 50,000 effective data in the ITS database. The smallest support is 0.01, and the lowest degree of confidence is 0.10.Finally, frequent patterns of effective association rules are shown as follows R1:L5=> V1 10%, 16% indicates that the possibility of running a red light in place L5 is 16%, and support degree is 10 R2:E2=> V2 31%, 42% indicates that the possibility of the driver that education is senior middle school running a red light is 42%, and support degree is 31 R3:T1=> V1 36%, 40% indicates that the possibility of running a red light in the morning is 40%, and support degree is 36 According to above mining patterns, we can conclude that running a red light in the place L5 is very serious. In fact, this place is the access to province level roads and the peripheral municipal traffic transportation. So, the traffic flow is big. Simultaneously, L5 is far away from the urban district and the poli ce forces are separated. We suggested that the hairpin curves or the multi-level crossing bridge should be constructed to reduce the traffic pressure; we also should increase police forces to strengthen management. In violation regulation records many drivers’ education is elementary school.  It also explains that the driver's self-consciousness of observing traffic regulations at this education level is low Regarding to this educational level drivers, we should strengthen a training to enhance the self-consciousness of observing the traffic regulations. The serious time interval of violation regulations is the early morning when people are going to work .At many roads, the management of traffic polices can not meet the needs, the better management is expected to enhance  5. Conclusion  In summary, a data mining algorithm is used in intelligent transportation system. The result manifests that the algorithm is effective th rough testing in intelligent transportation system  References    C a o W e i dong, “Appl i cat i on Anal y s i s of Dat a M i ni ng in Intelligent Ttansport System Computer engineering  vol.31, 2005, pp.94-96    Li u Xu Guojun M a o.An Al gori t hm t o Approxi m a t e l y  Mine Frequent Closed Itemsets from Data Streams.

and visual feature clusters by data mining technology For example, in Figure 2 keyword 2 is possibly associated with the clusters with red dash-line \(i.e Cluster\(F1,2 and Cluster\(F2, L   3.3. Mining process  Based on the illustration in Figure 2, we give the mining process for cross-modal association rule as follows. Firstly, based on the keyword inverted index in our VAST system 1 a record of the keyword inverted index table I is defined as follows Q j image j i  k i=1,…, N j k=1,…,M j i   1  where Q j is one keyword and image j,i,k is one image that contains the keyword Q j and belongs to one web page W j,i Therefore W j i  image j i k k=1,…,M j i   2  Thus, formula \(1\be transformed as follows Q j W j i i=1,…, N j    3  where W j,i is the images containing keyword Q j and belonging to one web page. Considering the images with close size in the same web page always have semantic homogeneity and generally have some common keywords, we assume they belong to the same category For each image j,i,k we build an image-cluster table i.e. one image must belong to one cluster, and a record of the table is defined as follows image j i k C p    4  where C p is the cluster that the image j,i,k belongs to According to \(3\d \(4 the itemset of transaction T in database D is Q j C i i=1,…, m   5  where C i i=1,…, m are the clusters set.  Therefore many transactions can be deduced from one record of I  Only the itemsets containing at least one keyword and one visual cluster are considered. To satisfy the support-confidence framework, we define the support  and confidence of the association rule as follows supp\(Q j  Q j D   6  supp\(C i  C i D   7  where D\(Q j  is the set of images labeled with keyword Q j in database D  D\(C i  is the set of images in cluster Q i and D is the number of images in database D  Similarly supp\(Q j C i i=1,…, m p\(Q j C i i=1,…, m   8  conf\(Q j C i i=1,…, m p\(Q j C i i=1,…, m }\ /p\(Q j    9  The extended association rule generation algorithm is given by Table 1 based on A-priori algorithm and the above formulas. It is used to identify the frequent itemsets and generate strong association rules. Each superset of frequent itemsets with cardinality K  belongs to a set of candidate itemsets of size K i.e S K  Table 1   Cross-modal association rule generation algorithm In p ut Transaction Database D  Minimum Support Threshold min_supp  Output Frequent Itemset L  1  L 1  Q j  supp  Q j  min_supp   2  L 1  L 1  C i  supp\(C i   min_supp   3  L 2  Q j  C i  Q j  L 1  C i   L 1   supp  Q j  C i  min_supp   4  for K 3 L K-1    K o  5  S K  s k  s k  is K-itemset and a combination  of frequent sets from L K-1    6  for   D T   and   K k S s   do  7  if   T s k  do  8   supp  c k   supp  c k 1/|D  9   end if 10  end for 11   L K  c k supp c k _supp  12  end for 13   2 K K L L    14  return L  We can get the strong association rules like Q j C i i = 1, · · · ,m the algorithm in Table 1 with defining two thresholds, i.e min_supp and min_conf  Table 2 shows the characteristic of association rules distribution. It is interesting that the 1% series seems to have more items with higher confidence than 20% and 40%, while the 10% series seems to have confidence around 1%. Of course, the percentage of association rules decrease with the support and confidence increasing Table 2  The number of cross-modal association rules with the different min_supp and min_conf min_supp 0.01% 0.1% 1 10 conf>1% 101 1,306 123,861 8,798 conf>5% 0 120 22,409 1,425 conf>20% 0 0 17,820 68 conf>40% 0 0 12,414 7 Table 3 shows some examples of the cross-modal association rule.

 4. Retrieval by cross-modal association rule  We re-rank the initial keyword-based search results with the cross-modal association rules in VAST system  to m a ticall y  As to t h es e ru les co n t ai n i ng  k e yw ord  Q j have the same D\(Q j  and D in formula \(6\nd \(7 the clusters in these rules can be sorted by their  confidence  in descending  order. The query process can be defined as fellows 1  A user enters a query keyword Q j  2  Run the plain textual ranked boolean query based on the keyword-based inverted index and get the initial retrieved images result D\(Q j   3  Look up the association rules table, if there exist the association rules containing the keyword Q j  like the formula \(5\en go on; else go to step 9 4  According to the confidence  of these rules, we order the clusters in these rules containing keyword Q j by their confidence  5  For the top-N initial retrieved images in D\(Q j   the images in the cluster with the largest confidence ranks first, then subsequently the images in the cluster with the second largest confidence, and the same is valid for the rest 6  The images within a cluster are ranked by EMD distance to the cluster centroid in ascending order 7  The images not in these clusters are put in the last by their original order 8  Get the re-ranked results based on 5\6\d 7 9  Return the result to user It can be seen from above that, if exists the association rule for Q j the images that both are contained in the clusters in corresponding rules and include the keyword Q j have higher rank. Otherwise the query process reduces to pure keyword search  5.

 then it is considered that flying support belongs to ITVL x  w hereas if the weight of flying support is more towards ITVL y it will be considered as ITVL y support. However, if t he weight of flying support is equal between two ITVLs we will assume that flying support belongs to the ITVL from where the sequential pattern flying support has started   Fig. 3.  Standard and Flying Support  I 1\. Valid Interval Definition After discussing the flying support concept valid interval can be defined as: an interval \(ITVL\ is valid with reference to a given sequential pattern SP, if it satisfies the user defined parameters SD SW within the said ITVL and one of the following conditions is true  267  Standard Support is 001 min_supp 267  Standard Support + Flying Support 001 min_supp 267  Flying Support 001 min_supp  C. Longest Interval \(Problem Definition The problem to mine all the longest intervals can be defined as \223Suppose we have a database of events D and a sequential pattern SP  along with all its user defined parameters and also the user defined granularity The problem is to discover all the longest intervals satisfying the min_ilen parameter for each cycle D 1 D 2 D 3 205.D n 224  I Framework to Discover Longest Intervals Due to the temporal and inter-transactional characteristics of sequential patterns it is recognised that longest interval discovery will be quite an expensive process Consequently  it is important to devise different t echniques, which can help to scan the minimum amount of the database during the mining process Keeping in view the above consideration we decompose the problem of longest interval discovery into four sub-problems These sub problems are basically set of valid intervals with different length  267  Strictly Loose Seed Interval \(SLSI 267  Loose Seed Interval \(LSI 267  Seed Interval \(SI 267  Longest Interval \(LI                               Fig. 4.  Framework to Discover Longest Intervals  T wo main search techniques the Interval Validation Process IVP and the Process Switching Mechanism PSM are introduced here for the discovery of all the longest intervals in each cycle. The main objective of IVP is to confront the complexities which emerge due to the sequential/temporal nature of sequential patterns whereas PSM is devised to increase the efficiency of the mining process by only scanning relevant intervals from the database  I.1.\  IVP \(Interval Validation Process During different stages of the longest interval discovery process, PSM passes the C ITVL Current Interval\ to IVP to v erify if the C ITVL is valid or not \(Fig 4\. IVP first checks t he validity of C ITVL by counting standard support and then i f required it also counts the flying support to check C ITVL  v alidation.  IVP utilises DSCP \(Dynamic Support Counting Process during the standard support counting process for each data sequence DSCP scans only the minimum number of required data-sets from the database in order to find the support of a given sequential pattern\. This process continues until the counted support of the given SP is equal to min_supp parameter and IVP returns \223valid\224 to PSM or there is no data sequence left in C ITVL to check \(IVP returns 223 invalid\224 to PSM If after checking the standard support IVP retains \223invalid\224 against C ITVL then the flying support c oncept needs to be explored \(Fig 4  Algorithm IVP \(Interval Validation Process\ for standard ITVL stage=s_supp indicate different stages of IVP  i=1  counter to fetch next record CS=0  current support of given SP  CR  current record C_Supp  calculated Support RR   remaining records TR   total records if stage=s_supp then  IVP is in standard support stage  LR_ID LR C ITVL     Fetch the last record ID  Loop ITVL Y  Standard Support Flying Support ITVL X  Time Line

We can call this ITVL as FF ITVL Forward Flying I nterval However after checking the FF ITVL  if C ITVL  is s till invalid then certain portions of C ITVL  and P ITVL   Previous Interval\ have to be scanned as well; we call such ITVL as BF ITVL Backward Flying Interval\ \(Fig 6                                Fig. 6.  Flying Intervals  O nce the FF ITVL is created, the next step is to find pattern s upport in it. Upon finding the flying support for C ITVL IVP a ggregates the support against C ITVL  in the data structure  Table 1 This aggregation depends on the weight of the discovered flying support For example if 70 of the weight is in C ITVL then current support is aggregated with 0 7.

It scans the first ITVL to check if it is a valid interval  If IVP discovers that C ITVL  Current I nterval\ is invalid then the process simply moves to N ITVL   Next Interval and this process continues until PSM discovers SLSI or the process reaches the last ITVL of the said cycle \(Fig 8-a                                   Fig. 7.  Different stages of longest ITVL  However, if C ITVL is recognised as valid interval it means 


 that we have found the first SLSI. Upon finding the SLSI PSM undertakes the second sub-problem discovery of LSI According to the definition of LSI for any LSI at least first and last ITVL of potential loose SI have to be valid therefore PSM jumps to the last interval of the potential loose seed interval. The reason for this jump is in the following property of longest interval  267  The longest interval cannot be less than min_ilen and every ITVL within the longest interval has to be valid ITVL  Hence, if we found that ITVL 8 is invalid then there is no n eed to check the ITVLs between ITVL 4  to ITVL 7  since t hey cannot be part of any longest interval \(Fig 8-b  After jumping to the last ITVL of potential LSI PSM again passes the C ITVL to IVP to check if the ITVL is valid o r not. If it is recognised that C ITVL is invalid then it means c urrent SLSI cannot be a part of any longest interval Therefore PSM switches to forward mode by moving to the N ITVL  Next Interval and the process of searching the n ext Strictly Loose Seed Interval \(SLSI\ continues \(Fig 8c\.  However, if C ITVL is valid at this stage, that means we h ave found the first LSI Upon discovering the LSI PSM confronts the third sub-problem discovery of SI To discover SI, PSM has to scan the remaining ITVLs between first and last ITVL of the already discovered LSI Therefore PSM switches into backward mode and scans the ITVL, which is one ITVL previous than the C ITVL Fig 8 d  Validation of C ITVL is checked by IVP again. If C ITVL is i dentified as valid interval then the process of discovering the seed interval will continue  PSM will remain in backward mode and moves to the previous ITVLs one by one to check the validity of different ITVLs This process continues until PSM reaches the already discovered valid interval or it encounters an invalid interval \(Fig 8-e  During the process of discovering SI, if PSM encounters an invalid ITVL at any stage, then it does not have to check the rest of the ITVLs of LSI \(as this LSI cannot be part of any LI\. In this scenario, PSM assigns a new value to SLSI that is the last valid interval identified by PSM in \(see Fig 8-f new SLSI is assigned with ITVL 7 Now the process of d iscovering the next LSI proceeds again. According to the definition of LSI for any LSI at least the first and last ITVLs have to be valid therefore PSM jumps to the last interval of the potential loose seed interval. How long this jump will be depends on the min_ilen parameter If PSM continues in backward mode and reaches the already discovered ITVL then it means we have found a consecutive set of valid intervals whose length is equal to the min-ilen parameter which is the definition of SI In that scenario PSM jumps to the first ITVL after the last ITVL of current SI and the discovery process of LI proceeds \(Fig 8-g\.  In the Longest Interval \(LI\ discovery process PSM switches to forward mode to check the validity of the C ITVL However, if the C ITVL is identified as v alid interval then the seed interval is extended by this C ITVL  This process continues until PSM encounters an i nvalid ITVL or PSM reaches the last interval of the data set. Once PSM encounters an invalid ITVL the process of extending the seed interval terminates. The discovered LI is stored in the data structure and the PSM algorithm proceeds to the search of the next SLSI Fig 9 As we have to discover all the longest intervals for each cycle, the process given in Fig 4 is recursive and it will continue until all the longest intervals of each cycle are found D.  PIDeriver Algorithm for Periodic Interval Discovery Once all the longest intervals for each cycle are discovered with the above motioned approach we can straightforwardly implement the PIDeriver algorithm presented by Chen in 1  t o  d e r i v e  a l l  t h e  p e r i o d i c  t i m e  intervals for a given sequential pattern              Fig. 9.  Discovery process for LI V  INCREMENTAL  DATA  MINING M ining periodicity for sequential patterns is a time consuming process Maintaining the already discovered periodic patterns in the updated database is very important since new data may invalidate some of the discovered periodic patterns and new periodic patterns may emerge due to new data Assuming that the cyclicity granularity and sequential pattern of interest remain the same the approach presented in this paper to discover periodic time intervals for a specific SP can be used for incremental mining of periodic time intervals as well  The approach presented in this paper divides the main problem of finding the periodic time intervals into two sub-problems finding the longest interval for each cycle and discovery of periodic intervals by using already discovered longest intervals of each cycle  Since the second problem is purely based on mining results of first problem the discovered longest intervals in the previous data mining efforts can be used in an incremental data mining process. During the incremental data mining process the algorithm will only focus on finding the longest intervals from new data. However, due to the temporal nature of sequential patterns some portion of the old database will be used as well, the size of this is directly proportional to the user defined parameter of SD Sequence Duration Since finding the longest interval involves most of the processing and complexity during the process of periodic time interval discovery this approach will benefit the incremental data mining quite significantly VI.GENERALISED  MODEL  FOR  FRAMEWORK T he Generalised model GN shows the discovery process of all data filtration transformation discovery of

Therefore, in this paper we mainly focused on the problem to find all the longest intervals for each cycle To confront the above problem efficiently, we introduced two main search techniques IVP Interval Validation Process\ and PSM \(Process Switching Mechanism\.  In this paper we have presented an effective mining approach for finding all the periodic time intervals for a given sequential pattern. As a future work the process presented in this paper can be extended to find periodic time intervals for all the given sequential patterns in one database scan However to accomplish this task a more complex data-structure/memory management technique needs to be implemented REFERENCES 1  X  Chen and I.
