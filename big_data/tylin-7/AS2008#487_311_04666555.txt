The determination of the optimal excess air coefficient is very important for economical analysis and operation optimization and it is a difficulty and bottleneck for operation optimization in power plants. Based on the association characteristic in electric industrial data, this paper proposes the operation optimization based on data mining in power plant. The improved fuzzy association rule mining algorithm is proposed and introduced to find the operation optimization values to guide the operation in power plant Based on the actual history data in 300MW unit, the optimization values in typical load ranges are found out by data mining to provide better guidance. Experiment results show that the operation optimization value determined by the improved fuzzy association rule mining algorithm can improve the efficiency and can be used to guide the operation online  1. Introduction  The study on operation optimization in power plant industry process is very active in recent years. The controllable factors that affect the thermal efficiency were analyzed to optimize the running process by considering the safety and economy. In this course, the difficulty is to decide the optimal values of the important controllable parameters [1 T h e q u an titati v e v a l u es o f th e s e  parameters can provide the decision-making for optimizing the system. Coal-fired boiler is a typical complex multi-input and multi-output plant with strong nonlinear and having no self-balance ability. Combustion process can be affected directly by parameter changes such as main steam pressure, feed water temperature, flue gas temperature, excess air coefficient, etc. So the problems of determining optimization values rationally have not been solved completely till now With the development of information technology electric industry accumulated a mass of data. Many important information and knowledge which can guide the decision-making are hidden in the mass data. Data mining has been recognized by many researchers as a key research topic in database systems and machine learning and by many industrial companies as an important area with an opportunity of major revenues. The association rule mining is an important task of data mining. Given a transaction database, it is desirable to discover the important association among items such that the presence of some item in a transaction will imply that of other items in the same transaction. Data mining provided a novel method for deciding the optimization values  2. Combustion optimization based on data mining  Main influential parameters of boiler combustion process are oxygen content in flue gas, furnace pressure main steam pressure and main steam flow. Oxygen content in flue gas embodies boiler’s thermal efficiency And main steam flow \(is also called load\ random variable that the combustio n process must adapt to Regulating method is air flow and the quantity of coalfeed. So the combustion optimizing process in power plant unit is a synthesized question h e k e y i s to  decide the optimization values for the industrial process parameters [3,4  T h e o p eratio n o p tim iza tio n i n  combustion process is to get the optimal point where the thermal efficiency is highest. The problems of deciding optimization values have not been solved till now due to the complex of combustion process Quantitative association rules were defined over quantitative and categorical attributes. The value of categorical attributes was mapped to a set of contiguous integers. While the domain of quantitative attributes was discretized into intervals by fine-partitioning the values of the attributes and combing the adjacent partitions as necessary, the intervals were then mapped to contiguous integers. As a result, each attribute had a form of  attribute  value where value was the mapped integer of an interval for quantitative attributes or a single value for categorical attributes. Then the algorithm for finding Boolean association rules can be used on the transformed database to discover quantitative association rules [5  Because distinct intervals will exclude those potential elements which are neighbouring the boundary, the data

which are close the boundary and contribute to both intervals will have to partial to one interval. To solve this problem, the fuzzy sets theory was introduced into the association mining process to soften the partition boundary of the domain and generalize and abstract the data. The fuzzy concept is better than the partition method because fuzzy sets provide a smooth transition between member and non-member of a set This paper proposed the improved fuzzy association rule mining algorithm to decide the optimization values from the history data in electric industry. The algorithm is very effective in mining Boolean association rules problem 000\003 The fuzzy association rules is in the form of If X is A and Y is B then Z is C where X  Y and Z were sets of attributes A  B and C were fuzzy sets which described X  Y and Z respectively. The process of mining fuzzy association rules can be divided into the following four steps 1\The transaction data is standardized and is transform-ed into fuzzy sets by using the membership functions 2\erate large fuzzy patterns by scanning the database 3\ Get fuzzy association rules. Having gotten large fuzzy patterns, the desired fuzzy association rules with the minimum confidence are generated 4\The quantitative association rules are achieved by anti the fuzzy association rules. These quantitative association rules are verified and the correct rules can be used to guide the industrial process online The architecture of operation optimization based on the improved data mining includes off-line and on-line process as shown in Figure 1. The operation state is represented by several running models which are attained by data mining process. A set of dynamic models are established and the reasoning rules are formed too. The operation optimization models are attained to guide the operation optimization from results of data mining according to the real-time data  Figure 1. The basic structure of operation optimization based on the improved data mining in power plant 3. Improved fuzzy association mining algorithm  In this paper the fuzzy sets theory was introduced into the association mining from quantitative data. The proposed improved fuzzy association rule mining algorithm first transforms each quantitative value into a fuzzy set with linguistic terms using membership functions. The algorithm then calculates the scalar cardinality of each linguistic term on all the transaction data using the temporary set. The mining process based on fuzzy counts is then performed to find fuzzy association rules. The improved fuzzy association rule mining algorithm is described as follows Input: A body of n transaction data, each with m attribute values, a set of membership functions, a predefined minimum support value and a predefined confidence. The j th i 1, 2 m ute in the i th i 1 2 n transaction can be described by k membership function  1,2 ijs R sk   where  1 2  js R sk  is the fuzzy sets of the j th attribute Output: A set of fuzzy association rules Step 1: Transform the quantitative value  1 2  j i tj m  of each transaction  1 2  i Ti n  in D into a fuzzy set j i f  j i t is described by fuzzy sets as  12 12      ij ij ijk j i jj jk R RR f RR R    1 where j l R is l-th fuzzy region of attribute j i t in D  Setp 2: Calculate the scalar cardinality for all transactions in the transaction data  1 2  i Ti n   1 1  n j sijs i weight R n    000 2 Step 3: Check whether the j s weight of each fuzzy region \(1  1  js R jm sk 002\002 002\002 is larger or equal to the predefined minimum support. If j s weight is equal to or greater than the minimum support, put it into the set of large 1-itemsets 1 L That is  1  1 1  js js L R weight minsupport j m s k 003\002\002\002\002 3 Step 4: Set r 1, where r is used to represent the number of items kept in the current large itemsets Step 5: Generate the candidate set 1 r C  from r L in a similar method to that of the Apriori algorithm. Restated the algorithm joins r L and r L under the condition that 1 r  items in the two itemsets are the same and the other one is different. The itemsets which have all their subr itemsets in r L are put into 1 r C   Step 6: Do the following substeps for each newly formed r 1\itemset 12 1     r ttt t   in 1 r C   a For each transaction i T calculate its fuzzy value on t as  12 1     r it it it it RR R     004\004\004 4

It is based on reasoning and easy to be understood and applied in industrial process  4. The determination of optimal excess air coefficient based on the improved fuzzy association rule mining  4.1. Determination of optimal excess air coefficient based on data mining  Based on the history data of a 300MW power plant unit whose type is N 300-16.7/537/537-3, the typical parameters which are related to combustion process are analyzed. Those parameters include load, excess air coefficient 005 the carbon content in fly ash, flue gas temperature and thermal efficiency T h e quantitative association rules are acquired by analyzing the history data. For example, Load 1  n L L eters  1  n PP eters 1  m TT  000 Coal consumption  1  g gn B B a given typical load range, the parameters related to low coal consumption rate are chosen as optimization values to optimize the electric industrial process. The rule to determine the optimal parameter values is expressed as 111          nnn L oad L L Parameter P P Parameter T T 000  By this way the optimal operation parameters are decided according to load and the other related conditions Take a data set with 10 transaction as an example to illustrate the mining process with the improved fuzzy association rule mining algorithm. The data mining process with large items are similar to that of this mining process. The data set includes 10 transactions which are gotten by sampling in the database, as shown in Table 1 Each case consists of five course parameters: Load denoted Ld cess air coefficient 005 denoted Ear  Unburned carbon in flue dust \(denoted Ucd lue gas temperature \(denoted Fgt d thermal efficiency denoted Effi The minimum support is set at 0.30 and the minimum confident is set at 0.75  Table 1.  The industrial process parameters of a 300MW unit in typical running state   Each course is thought as an attribute in the mining process and each attribute has three fuzzy regions Low  Middle and High Thus three fuzzy membership values are produced for each course according to the predefined membership functions. The membership function of load is shown in Figure 2. The membership functions of other parameters are similar to that of load 290 294 296 300 286 284 280  1 Low Middle High MW  Figure 2. The membership function of load The transaction data in Table 1 are first transformed into fuzzy sets, with the results shown in Table 2  Table 2.

 The  large 1-itemsets 1 L uilt as shown in Table 3 Table 3 L 1 Large 1-itemsets  The candidate 2-itemsets 2 C is built base on 1 L as shown in Table 4 Table 4 2 C candidate 2-itemsets  The large 2-itemsets 2 L is built based on 2 C according to minsupport 3 Table 5 2 L large 2-itemsets  The candidate 3-itemsets 3 C is built based on 2 C  according to minsupport 3 Table 6 3 C candidate 3-itemsets   The support of sup H M i H\=0.30 Ld Ear Eff is larger or equal to minsupport So 3 L is built. So the fuzzy association rule H M H Ld Ear Effi 000 is obtained according to Step 9. The conf idence of this rule is as follows confidence H M H sup H M H 3.0 81.1 sup H M 3.7 Ld Ear Effi Ld Ear Effi Ld Ear 000   The confidence of this rule is larger than minconfidence 75%\ From the results of the data mining we can conclude that the combustion thermal efficiency reaches maximum value \(no less than 92%\when the excess air coefficient 005 is set between 1.34 and 1.43 at full load range \(296MW~300MW\The middle value or the weighted average of intervals can be adopted to decide the optimization point. The optimization value of excess air coefficient 005 is 1.42 when the load is 300MW 100%\ using the weighted average method. In a given typical load range, the excess air coefficient related to low coal consumption are chosen as optimization value to guide the operation. The optimal values obtained from data mining and designed values are listed in Table 7 Table  7. The comparison of designed value and optimal values of excess air coefficient   4.2. The optimal curve of excess air coefficient and its application in operation optimization  According to the method mentioned above, by utilizing the fuzzy association mining to mine the important parameters when the typical load range of 75%, 90% and 100%, etc, a set of optimization values is obtained. The optimal curve of excess air coefficient can be obtained by regression analysis of the optimal values determined by data mining. The coefficients and the significant tests of the regression curve are presented in Table 8. The t test is used and the unstandardized coefficients and standardized coefficients are also given. The coefficients in regression equation are statistically significant. The regression equation between load and optimal excess air coefficient is established. The optimal excess air coefficient in certain load and corresponding operation conditions can be calculated using formula \(8 2 1.589 0.0004 0.000004839 yxx   8 Table 8.

Conclusion  This paper proposed an improved fuzzy data mining algorithm and applied the improved algorithm to determined the optimization values in power plant combustion process. The fuzzy data mining method has the following virtues: \(1\he rules of deciding the target values are straightforward and easy to guide operation. \(2 Based on the actual data in industrial process, the rules can reflect the actual status. \(3\The target values can be dynamically regulated to reflect the variety of the unit status. \(4\The target value is presented in an interval, so the operator can have more choices in the interval to optimizing the running course according the actual state of the unit. The rules mined out exhibit quantitative regularity in large history database and can be used to provide guides and suggestions to the appropriate operator. Experimental results with the data in a 300MW power plant show that the improved algorithm based on fuzzy sets operation performs very well and can be used to guide the operating process to achieve a good performance  References   i Wei  R e n  H a oren an d S h e n g D e re n    D e v el opi ng a software for analyzing on-line the energy-loss for 300MW unit,” Proceedings of the CSEE, vol. 22, no. 11 pp. 153-155, November, 2002   i L i n    O pti m al con t rol of ration of air a n d coal f o r industrial boiler,” Automation and Instrumentation, vol 13, no. 4, pp. 35-37, May, 1998  3 H u H o ngh ua  H ua n g T i ng hu i  a nd A i W e i guo   S t ud y and determination of operation optimization target values of large size fossile-fired power unit,” Electric Power, vol 37, no. 9, pp. 22-25, September, 2004   i Wei  L i u Ch a n g dong  an d S h e n g D e ren    S t a t u s and development trend of economic operation and optimization system in domestic coal-fired power plant Power System Engineering, vol. 20, no. 1, pp. 59-61 January, 2004  5  Srik an t an d R   A g r a w a l  M i n i n g q u a n ti tati v e  association rules in large relational tables”, The 1996 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, Monreal, Canada, June 1996, pp:112   i u Fu gu o, H a o Wei don g  an d Y a n g Ji an z h u   Economic analyze for utility boiler operated in different oxygen content outlet furnace and it’s optimization Proceedings of the CSEE, vol. 23, no. 2, pp. 172-176 February, 2003   Project Supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China \(Grant No 50776030   Project Supported by Doctor Degree Teacher Foundation of North China Electric Powe r University Grant No. 93102701

Discussion  Applying DruTiMine on several tissues for cancer has proven the validity of the system where text mining and association rule mining are used based on microarray experiments to identify drug targets for the specified disease and tissue type. DruTiMine can help pharmaceuticals to identify drug targets of proteins/genes/chemical compounds in silicon instead of going through major steps of laboratory tests in vitro This does not mean that laboratory tests will not be needed, but the need for systems like DruTiMine is becoming a must for providing guidance to experts before conducting laboratory experiments Microarray experiments have proven through DruTiMine, to be very useful for deriving drug targets of proteins/genes/chemical compounds. The system is capable of relating proteins identified in Medline database abstracts to differentially expressed genes in microarray experiments and provided insight on possible associations among a variety of related biological information such as gene molecular functions gene biological process and gene cellular components which is definitely of value in speeding up the drug target discovery phase of the drug discovery process      6. C onclusions and future work  DruTiMine has been introduced as a new system for identifying drug targets based on microarray experiments  Given a user-selected disease and associated criteria as mentioned above the user can identify drug targets related to this disease starting with microarray experiments.  We have explained the architecture process and usage scenario of how to discover drug targets through the integration between text mining and association rule mining We have tested our system to cancer with eight different tissues breast kidney ovarian prostate pancreatic liver skin, and lung.  In our future work, we will develop a protein-protein interaction network describing the type of interaction we can extract from related publications in order to understand the type of interaction affecting diseases Finally regarding our microarray experiments\222 retrieval we intend to consider other microarray databases such as ArrayExpress and Stanford microarray database  7.

Therefore, in this paper we mainly focused on the problem to find all the longest intervals for each cycle To confront the above problem efficiently, we introduced two main search techniques IVP Interval Validation Process\ and PSM \(Process Switching Mechanism\.  In this paper we have presented an effective mining approach for finding all the periodic time intervals for a given sequential pattern. As a future work the process presented in this paper can be extended to find periodic time intervals for all the given sequential patterns in one database scan However to accomplish this task a more complex data-structure/memory management technique needs to be implemented REFERENCES 1  X  Chen and I.
