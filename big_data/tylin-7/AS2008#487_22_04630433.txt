Linguistic Summarization of Network Traf“c Flows Federico Montesino Pouzols Angel Barriga Diego R Lopez and Santiago S  anchez-Solano Abstract  We address by means of fuzzy linguistic summaries two related problems summarizing network ow statistics and making these statistics human-readable Two complementary summarization methods are developed First a xed set of protoforms of interest is de“ned and the ones with a higher truth value are shown to the user as simple on-line summaries This rst method is suitable for real-time monitoring Then an association rules mining process is carried out in order to nd hidden relations in ow records Both approaches are implemented in a tool capable of real-time 
and off-line processing of network ow records Experimental results for a number of heterogeneous NetFlow records show the usefulness of linguistic summaries to both network practitioners and users I I NTRODUCTION W ITH an increasing diversity of technologies applications and trafc patterns the analysis of network trafc ows is becoming more and more complex and a full understanding of all the relevant facts is now far beyond the practical possibilities of network operators managers and planners Current network measurement systems are becoming highly sophisticated and produce huge amounts of measurement data and statistics High-precision network measurement in current backbones implies the generation of tens of GBs of data per hour The major objective of network 
measurement systems is to provide an understanding of how networks perform However the gap between network measurement systems and user comprehension is increasing There are many visualization tools for network measurements see  for a n e xtensi v e list which a re mostly based on plots and charts to evaluate statistical properties of time series scaling properties and protocol behavior The visualization and reporting tools employed nowadays provide reports made of tens of plots graphs and tables Thus it is not easy for experts to extract simple summaries Additionally the complexity of reporting and monitoring tools is holding back the adoption by end users Federico Montesino Pouzols and Santiago S  anchez-Solano are with the Microelectronics Institute of Seville CSIC Scientic

have been developed throughout the years However most of them are quantitative suited for specic data types and designed for a particular purpose There is a lack of general-purpose tools for qualitative exploration and analysis of Internet measurements which is a rst step needed for hypothesis-driven discovery analysis and validation  In this context it is becoming more and more necessary to extract concise summaries that should be several orders of magnitude smaller than the original measurement dataset and should express how the network performs in ideally no more than a few lines of human-readable text In this paper  w e address the problem of summarizing network statistics into brief reports and making them human-readable by means of 
fuzzy linguistic summaries Linguistic summaries via fuzzy logic have been shown to be a simple efcient and human consistent data mining means Linguistic summaries as introduced by Yager  and further de v e loped by Kacprzyk and Y ager  6 and Kacprzyk and Zadro  zny  a re linguistically quantied propositions as Most trafc ows have an average packet size small with a degree of truth Section II outlines network statistics based on the NetFlow technology Section III denes linguistic summaries as considered in this work Section IV denes linguistic summaries of network ow records and describes two complementary ways of implementing them Finally section V shows experimental results for a set of benchmark NetFlow records II N ETWORK 
F LOW S TATISTICS N ET F LOW Most network operations centres currently collect statistics on the performance of their infrastructure These statistics are mainly based on the concept of ow dened as a unidirectional sequence of packets between given source and destination end-points NetFlow  i ntroduced by Cisco Systems in 1996 as a technology for route caching is nowadays a de facto standard for passive measurement and monitoring in the Internet NetFlow based measurement is used for performance analysis application and user monitoring trafc engineering capacity planning billing peering agreement and security From the viewpoint of a router a ow is made of a 
sequence of IP packets sharing the same values for a set of properties within a time interval source and destination IP address source and destination transport level port transport layer 3 protocol type type of service and incoming interface see gure 1 Thus a ow in the sense of NetFlow is unidirectional NetFlow records consider ow properties at the link network IP and transport layers i.e no specic information from the application layer is included 619 978 1 4244 1819 0/08  25.00 c  2008 IEEE

router in real-time Proper aggregation and summarization techniques allow for analyzing network performance The ow identiers and some of the basic attributes considered in the most extended versions of NetFlow are listed in Table I Additional attributes are available as extensions Derived attributes are also dened from the measured attributes such as the throughput or transfer rate bytes/duration Upon expiry of a ow its statistics are accumulated and reported to a collector using the NetFlow protocol In order to standardize the NetFlow technology the IP Flow Information Export IPFIX working group of the Internet Engineering Task Force IETF  is dening the I PFIX standard which only differs from NetFlow in terminology and minor details as well as improvements to the ow transfer protocol but keeps the same principles architecture applicability and information model as NetFlow version 9 Currently the statistics reported by basic collector tools summarize ow records in the form of aggregation of counters and statistical descriptors such as percentiles Analysis and visualization of ow collections is an active area of research and man y visualization t echniques ha v e been developed particularly for topology analysis However the general summarization capabilities of available tools do not go beyond basic statistic descriptors reports of top users and tables and plots of distribution functions as for example the automatically generated Internet2 weekly reports available online from http://netow.internet2.edu/weekly These tools are usually based on statistics and provide relevant reports However the reports can easily become human unreadable because of the huge amount of tables and graphs generated Techniques and tools for extracting short yet meaningful reports are sought Simple aggregation capabilities have been introduced with recent versions of NetFlow as a simple method for summarization of ow records It is possible for instance to request from a router ow records aggregated by autonomous system This novel capability has been introduced as a response to the need of summarization mechanisms for preprocessing ow records Although these methods are powerful and reveal a great deal of useful information about how networks perform the whole amount of available measurement data and most complex relations underlying them are still difcult to understand Recent versions of NetFlow also integrate sampling capabilities With NetFlow sampling only a percentage of trafc is accounted for measurement purposes In order to restrain the load on network processors a sampling of packets is performed typically on the 1-10 of the total trafc while 90-99 of packets are not accounted for performance measurement purposes Thus some of ow statistics are affected by uncertainty These sampling capabilities are extensively used in current measurement infrastructures III L INGUISTIC S UMMARIES Linguistic summaries as proposed by Yager a re a data mining technique for summarizing data collections using linguistically quantied propositions s uch as Most trafc ows are short lived In this work we consider the extended denition by Kacprzyk and Zadro  zny  t hat leverages on the concept of protoform Linguistic summaries have a number of advantages when compared against classical statistical methods of summarization they can summarize both numeric and non-numeric data can provide many different summaries for specic purposes and have the ability to provide natural language summaries Linguistic summaries are obtained by means of a mining process on a usually large set of entities by which a natural language expression summarizes essential facts about the set In the sense of Yager 5 a linguistic summary i s dened as follows Given  D   d 1 d N   a set of entities that manifest some attributes e.g a set of trafc ows in a NetFlow collection 620 2008 IEEE I n t erna t ional C on f erence on F u zzy Sy s t ems FUZZ 2008 


 A   A 1 A M  a set of attributes dened over the entities in the set D  e.g the set of attributes in a NetFlow collection such as packet count destination address starting time etc A basic linguistic summary is made of  A summarizer S  dened as a linguistic expression or predicate semantically represented by a fuzzy set i.e short lived  A quantity in agreement or quantier Q  dened as a linguistic quantier that indicates the extent to which the entities satisfy the summary e.g most  A measure of validity or quality of the summary The basic validity criterion is the truth value of the summary T  dened as a truth value of a linguistically quantied statement The truth value can be computed using a number of methods in particular Zadeh’s fuzzylogic-based calculus of linguistically quantied propositions and Y ager s O W A operators  12 Fuzzy subsets are employed to represent the linguistic terms that specify a summarization S and a quantier Q  Thus the truth value of both can be denoted by their respective membership functions  S  x  and  F  x   being its universe of discourse that of one or more of the attributes in the set A  A summary  S  Q  of a data set D with N elements from a measurement space X is usually written in generic form as  Q d’s are S  i.e Q ows are S  as in the statement most ows are long lived D  Q  S  read as Q d i are S 1 S is a then fuzzy subset of D and Q is a fuzzy set in the range 0  1  For instance the membership function of the quantier most can be dened as  Q  x   1  for x  0  85 2 x  0  7  for 0  35 x 0  85 0  for x  0  35 Then T is a truth value in 0  1 that can be computed from a summary as in equation 1 applying Zadeh’s calculus T  D  Q  S   Q  1  n N  i 1  S  d i   The truth value of fuzzy linguistically quantied propositions is just a primary quality measure of summaries Additional measures of the goodness of a linguistic summary in terms of degree of interest non-triviality or unexpectedness are usually required in practice in order to select relevant summaries The kind of summarizer in equation 1 can be generalized to a compound summarizer form made of the conjunction of any number of linguistic expressions about the attributes of the entities in D asin“Mostows are long lived and have an average packet size small and are high throughput Extended linguistic summaries can be dened by adding a qualier R  also a subset of D as QR d’s are S  i.e QR ows are S  as in the statement most ows at night are long lived D  Q  R  S  read as  QR d  s are S  2 In the case of equation 2 the degree of truth of the summary can be determined by Zadeh’s calculus as follows T  D  Q  R  S   Q       N  i 1   S  d i    R  di  N  i 1  R  d i       012 Extended linguistic summaries can be thought as fuzzy i f t hen rules where the antecedent is R and the consequent S  stating that if Q entities ows satisfy R then they satisfy S  Linguistic summaries whether extended or not can be compound as well as in most high throughput ows are long lived and have a packet size medium In this case the universe of discourse of the summarizer is extended to that of a set of attributes Thus linguistic summaries as considered here are essentially linguistically qualied propositions in the sense of Zadeh’s calculus Protoforms of linguistic summaries are dened as abstracted prototypes and may form a hierarchy  A c lassication of possible protoforms of linguistic summaries is developed in F o r i nstance replacing Q with a concrete quantier Mos t in equation 1 we obtain a particular kind of protoform Most ows are S  Another kind of protoform can be specied by xing the attribute or attributes of interest for S as Q ows are S A c  where A c is the attribute of interest For instance when one is interested in the duration of ows an appropriate protoform can be dened by restricting the summarizer to the linguistic labels dened for the duration attribute  Q ows are S duration  where S duration may take the form of any of the linguistic variables dened for the attribute duration IV D EFINITION OF LINGUISTIC SUMMARIES OF N ET F LOW C OLLECTIONS We propose two methods for the linguistic summarization of NetFlow collections Both are complementary to traditional methods of analysis and visualization of network ow statistics To this end a set of linguistic variables for ow attributes as well as a set of fuzzy quantiers have been dened Some NetFlow attributes are modeled with crisp values such as protocol destination port and interface numbers while some others are modeled using linguistic variables F or the l atter a ttrib utes f uzzy sets are dened using domain specic terminology as shown in table II For instance mice bulk and elephants are terms usually employed in the Internet measurement literature to refer to recurrent kinds of trafc ows with regards to its place in ow size distributions  10 2008 IEEE I n t erna t ional C on f erence on F u zzy Sy s t ems FUZZ 2008 621

association rule has the following form A 1  A 2    A n  A n 1  and states that those items for which attributes  A i  i  1 n  take value 1 will also take value 1 for attribute A n 1 An equivalence between linguistic summaries and association rules can be considered if the summarizer and the qualier are interpreted as the consequent and the antecedent of an association rule respectively Then the condence of a rule can be interpreted as the combination of the linguistic quantier and the truth value of the rule Two basic measures of the quality of an association rule are usually considered the support and the condence The support is dened as the fraction of the number of items supporting the set of attributes  A i  i  1 n 1  in the data collection The condence is dened as the fraction of the rows supporting  A i  i  1 n 1  among all items supporting  A i  i  1 n   While the support is a measure of the statistical signicance of a rule the condence is a measure of its strength The most interesting rules are those with a support higher than a minimal threshold and a high condence Generalized association rules are redened for fuzzy linguistic summaries mining as follows A 1 is f 1    A n is f n  A n 1 is f n 1    A n  m is f n  m  where f i are fuzzy linguistic variables A number of algorithms for association rules mining have been proposed For the implementation described in the next section the Apriori algorithm for fast discovery of association rules is used V E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS An experimental tool for generating NetFlow linguistic summaries with the two approaches described flow-lsummary  has been implemented The tool allows for the denition of fuzzy linguistic variables and protoforms of interest for the on-line mode in a

Simple on-line summaries for the NetFlow collections analyzed see table IV are shown in gures 3 4 and 5 In simple on-line mode flow-lsummary shows one summary about each of the considered protoforms see table III for the basic set i.e only the most relevant fact concerning each protoform is shown The user can ask for an unlimited number of summaries per protoform For instance in the case of the

Linguistic summaries provide a novel method to describe qualitative relations in NetFlow collections using natural language Thus by using association rules mining to nd relevant summaries we have a suitable method for addressing a problem related to ow analysis nding invariants in trafc what is known as one the major goals of Internet Science VI C ONCLUSIONS We have addressed network trafc analysis at the ow level from the perspective of linguistic summaries Two approaches for summarizing NetFlow collections have been developed 1 on-line summarization via a predened and congurable set of potential interesting protoforms and 2 discovery of hidden relevant summaries by means of association rules mining A tool that implements both approaches has been developed Experimental results for a set of benchmark NetFlow collections conrm linguistic summaries as an alternative look into network ow statistics useful for both network users and practitioners The method presented is a novel technique to generate simple and human-interpretable reports but also provides a promising technique for nding invariants in network trafc and advancing Internet Science This can be seen as a rst

If in Fig. 4 there is at least one T, then DCAR6 holds DCAR1 through DCAR6 forms a complement lattice shown in Fig. 5 In Fig. 5, the lower rule implies the upper rule That is, if DCARj is reachable from DCARi via an ascending path, and DCARi holds, then DCARj holds Because DCAR1 through DCAR6 satisfies Fig 5, their algorithms can be merged into one algorithm called connective determination algorithm, shown in Fig. 6 Suppose cf 1 80%, cf 2 75%. In Fig. 4, for the column of C1, there are M*cf 1 5*80%=4 elements whose values are T \(namely, S1, S2, S3, S5 Therefore, DCAR2: course\(Cno 004 1  student\(Sno 003 1  study\(Sno, Cno\olds. From Fig. 5, we know that DCAR3 and DCAR6 also hold. In Fig. 4, there are at least N*cf 2 4*75%=3 columns which have value T \(namely, in the column of C1 there is S1, in the column of C2 there is S1, in the column of C3 there is S2, in the column of C4 there is S5 therefore DCAR5: course\(Cno 003 1  student\(Sno 004 1  study\(Sno, Cno  VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS 1\ Double-connective association rule mining is different from single-connective association rule mining. The former mines the association among the primary keys of the two entity tables and the primary key of the binary relationship table. The latter mines the association between frequent item sets 2\. 4 is different from data cubes in data warehouses. The elements in Fig. 4 are T or F. The elements in the data cubes are data 3\The differences between double-connective association rule and database query are that, first, the query information in databases are predeterminate while the information to be mined by double-connective association rule is not predeterminate, it is implied. Secondly, database query needs to write SQL statements, while double-connective association rule mining is automatic. Thirdly, the information obtained by database query is quantitative, while the information obtained by double-connective association rule mining is qualitative such as “for many”, “there are some  REFERENCES 1 Ji a w ei H a n   M i ch eli n e K a m b er   D a t a  M i n i n g C onc ep t s  a nd Techniques, Higher Education Press, Beijing, 2001, Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, 2000 2 A  G  Ha m i lt on  L o gi c for M a th em a t i c ia ns R evi s ed E d i t i o n   Cambridge University Press, 1988, Tsinghua University Press Beijing, 2003 3 X unw e i Z h o u   Br ie f I ntr o du c t io n  to  Mu t u al l y I nve r s is tic Logic”, 1999 European Summer Meeting of the Association for Symbolic Logic, Utrecht, The Netherlands, August 1-6 1999 4 u n w ei Zh ou F i r s t leve l exp l i c i t m u lt ip le i ndu ct i v e composition”, 2005 Spring Meeting of the Association for Symbolic Logic, The Westin St. Francis Hotel, San Francisco CA.

support pruning gene expression classifier with an accurate and compact fuzzy rule base for microarray data analysis Biosystems vol 85 computationally challenging As training set sizes increase it is likely that these difficulties will also increase VI RELATED WORK While operating on a microarray dataset current CAR 1 2 3 4 and other pattern/rule 20 21 mining algorithms perform a pruned and/or compacted exponential search over either the space of gene subsets or the space of sample subsets Hence they are generally quite computationally expensive for datasets containing many training samples or genes as the case may be BSTC is explicitly related to CAR-based classifiers but requires no expensive CAR mining BSTC is also related to decision tree-based classifiers such as random forest 19 and C4.5 family 9 methods It is possible to represent any consistent set of boolean association rules as a decision tree and vice versa However it is generally unclear how the trees generated by current tree-based classifiers are related to high confidence/support CARs which are known to be particularly useful for microarray data 1 2 6 7 11 BSTC is explicitly related to and motivated by CAR-based methods To the best of our knowledge there is no previous work on mining/classifying with BARs of the form we consider here Perhaps the work closest to utilizing 100 BARs is the TOPRULES 22 miner TOP-RULES utilizes a data partitioning technique to compactly report itemlgene subsets which are unique to each class set Ci Hence TOP-RULES discovers all 100 confident CARs in a dataset However the method must utilize an emerging pattern mining algorithm such as MBD-LLBORDER 23 and so generally isn't polynomial time Also related to our BAR-based techniques are recent methods which mine gene expression training data for sets of fuzzy rules 24 25 Once obtained fuzzy rules can be used for classification in a manner analogous to CARs However the resulting fuzzy classifiers don't appear to be as accurate as standard classification methods such as SVM 25 VII CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK To address the computational difficulties involved with preclassification CAR mining see Tables IV and VI we developed a novel method which considers a larger subset of CAR-related boolean association rules BARs These rules can be compactly captured in a Boolean Structure Table BST which can then be used to produce a BST classifier called BSTC Comparison to the current leading CAR classifier RCBT on several benchmark microarray datasets shows that BSTC is competitive with RCBT's accuracy while avoiding the exponential costs incurred by CAR mining see Section VB Hence BSTC extends generalized CAR based methods to larger datasets then previously practical Furthermore unlike other association rule-based classifiers BSTC easily generalizes to multi-class gene expression datasets BSTC's worst case per-query classification time is worse then CAR-based methods after all exponential time CAR mining is completed O SlS CGl versus O Si CGi As future work we plan on investigating techniques to decrease this cost by carefully culling BST exclusion lists ACKNOWLEDGM[ENTS We thank Anthony K.H
