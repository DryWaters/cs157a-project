The concepts of data warehouse, multidimensional model and data mining, are essentials in the design and the deployment of such tools. In this 
paper we describe the design and implementation of a decisional tool, dedicated to a no lucrative goal institution. Our case study is a university that hopes to improve the quality of his service, by analyzing the pedagogical results, to discover the success and failure factors, and attempt to increase success chances of students. In this perspective we use OLAP \(Online Analytical Process\ and association rules discovery techniques Keywords Data warehouse, Data Mining, multidimensional model, OLAP I   I NTRODUCTION  The use of the decisional tools in enterprises, in the goal to 
improve the operational and strategic decisions quality, has been largely generalized since 1990. In the actual economical context, characterized by the competition pressures, the use of these tools become a valuable advantage to make the difference. Since enterprises possess a large volume of data probably in heterogeneous formats, dispatched in several databases, they need to deploy a decisional solution to exploit efficiently this data. The concept of data warehouse is essential in the deployment of such solution [1   A data warehouse is a data collection, that is integrated 
subject oriented, historised , summarized and available to interrogation and analysis [2 T h e d e pl o y m e n t of a da t a  warehouse consists to extract data from production bases organize them around subjects, and summarize them for decision aid [3   This challenge necessitates an appropriated design process and a data model witch is adapted to the decisional needs. So the multidimensional model seems the most fit to capture the characteristics of data warehouses. This model is based on tow concepts facts and dimensions which represent respectively 
the measures to be analyzed and the different axis of this analysis [4   In the classical case of a lucrative goal enterprise, measures deal to profitableness objectives, so they have often a financial consonance \(turnover, benefit, etc\. However, some no lucrative goals can be achieved with decisional tools, in institutions that do not evaluate their performance in terms of turnover, or benefits: the university is an interesting example of these institutions How to use decisional tools to improve the quality and the efficiency in higher education? What are available measures 
and relevant analysis dimensions in this context? What are success and failure factors for a student in a university syllabus In this paper we attempt to propose answers to these questions, by designing a decisional tool, to analyze pedagogical results in a university, using multidimensional analysis techniques, and data mining This paper is organized as fellows Section 2 discuss about the motivations of this work and some related works Section 3 describes our design process Section 4 describes the goals specification phase 
Section 5 discuss about analysis and enrichment of the information system Sections 6 and 7 present the design of the tow parts of our decisional tool Section 8 shows the architecture and some interfaces of the tool, and discuss about obtains results Section 9 summarizes the obtained results and future works II  MOTIVATIONS  AND  RELATED  WORKS In front of the annual statement of pedagogical results obtained by students in computer science department, of 
Houari Boumediene University of sciences and technologies which are on this side of our ambitions, some questions merit consideration, about the success and failure factors. Although the success is the result of a complex formula, with many variables, we state that we can master some of these parameters to maximize students' efficiency. We can attempt to do that, by analyzing the available measures of the student-university 


 relationship according different axis, and using OLAP \(Online Analytical Process\ techniques  6   In [7 e  h a ve pr op os e d a  d e c i s i o n a l  t ool for  d i s t a n t t u t o r s  in an e-learning platform, with the same objectives. However the automated relationship between e-tutor and e-learner in such platform, provide a rich source of click stream information. In the actual case study the measurable information is limited \(essentially marks obtained in examinations\, that necessitate an additional effort in the multidimensional design to exploit at best this information A second part of our work consists to discover associations between marks obtained by students in different pedagogical modules. Our goal is to reveal abnormal week links, between pedagogical modules witch belong to the same family to strengthen this links by improving the pedagogical contains We exploit the associative rules discovery techniques [8  9    III  DESIGN  PROCESS In the aim to design methodically our tool, we have adopted a goal oriented process design based on five steps. First we have proceeded to capture needs and specify the goals, by interviewing the principals’ actors of the pedagogical process teachers, students, studies manager…etc Then we have analyzed the available information system to identify the exploitable data as decisional support. Some insufficiencies in this information system lead us to extend it, by integrating the missing decision-making data. Finally we have proceeded to the design of the multidimensional model and the data mining module. Figure 1 shows our process design Figure 1   The five steps of the design process IV  GOALS  SPECIFICATION After discussion with different participants in the pedagogical process, we have listed some analysis axis susceptible to influence positively or negatively in the pedagogical results. We have also identified the studies and pedagogy manager as the principal actor of our system. We can list some of analysis axis as follows   Analysis of efficiency of each teacher in deal with the success ratio obtained by section and by module   Analysis of efficiency of each section in deal with the success ratio obtained, by teacher and by module   Analysis of the success ratio obtained in each module and each examination   Analysis of the students' absence ratio impact on the success ratio   Analysis of social situation impact on the success ratio   Analysis of the association between marks obtained in different pedagogical modules V  INFORMATION  SYSTEM  ANALYSIS  AND  ENRICHMENT After study of the information system available, we have notice some important insufficiencies in deal with a decisional exploitation, we can list   No trace of partial examination results   No trace about students absence ratio   A lack of personal information about students \(social situation So, we have stated that some of our goals can not be achieved in the actual situation. However we have proposed an enrichment of the actual information system, to support the decisional requirements. Figure 2 shows the UML class diagram of the enriched information system Figure 2  Extended class diagram of information system 


VI  MULTIDIMENSIONAL  DESIGN In this step we have proceed to the design of star schemes by identifying measures and dimensions. Measures are essentially provided by success and absence ratios. Dimensions correspond to the analysis axis of each measure The following figures \(figure 3, figure 4, figure 5\ are a sketch of our multidimensional model Figure 3  Efficiency1 fact Figure 4  Efficiency2 fact   Figure 5  Absence fact VII  DATA  MINING  DESIGN The second component of our decisional tool is a data mining module, which have as goal to discover the association between marks obtained by students in different pedagogical modules. More concretely, we hope to check if the presupposed associations between some modules are really effective in practice. For example "Information system" is considered as a prerequisite of "Data bases", so we have to check if students who have good marks in "Information system", have also good marks in "Data bases". This consists to discover rules such if good mark in IS good mark in DB with a high trust degree  In the opposite case, if this association is infirmed we suggest the creation of pedagogical committee, composed by teachers of the tow modules, to identify the causes of this anomaly, and eventually improve the contents of the courses for facilitating the passage between the tow pedagogical modules We have used the association rules discovery techniques especially A priori Algorithm [9   This iterative algorithm begins by finding frequent 1itemset, for example modules which are often acquired by the students. From this set, it can determine the frequent 2-itemsets that is the sets consisted of two modules frequently collectively acquired -because naturally so that two modules are collectively often acquired, each both has to be rather often allowed-. The algorithm continues until it finds no more k modules sets frequently collectively acquired     


VIII  IMPLEMENTATION  OF  THE  DECISIONAL  TOOL Our decisional tool was developed with Delphi 7.0 under the system Windows XP. The database was implemented with Oracle 9i A  General architecture of the solution The general architecture of our solution is characterized by a data warehouse that integrates data from the production system and external documents. Decisional data are organized in data cubes for OLAP \(Online Analytical Process\ analysis We can also access to the associative rules discovered by the data mining module. Figure 6 shows this architecture Figure 6  Architecture of the decisional tool B  Interface of the tool We can describe functionally our tool by the UML components diagram shown in figure 7 Figure 7  Components diagram The followed figures show some interfaces of our decisional tool Figure 8  Choice between the tow components of the tool Figure 9  Choice between different data cubes Figure 10  Visualization of a data cube    


 Figure 11  Fixing the support of A priori algorithm Figure 12   Discovered associative rules of A priori algorithm C  Tests and results The implemented tool has been tested on the Computer Science Department database, and has permitted a useful analysis of available data The OLAP analysis module permits to explore the different analysis axis, and their influence in success or failure of students. So we can for example discover the tendency of a particular teacher to give bad or good marks. We can also verify the impact of the students’ absences, on their results in exams.   The difficulties met by the students in certain modules with regard to the others, were also revealed by the tool The results obtained at this level, could be exploited by the direction of the studies to make decisions like   Make sensitive the teachers to question their methods of evaluation   Increase the hourly volume of the modules the results of which are below the average   Make sensitive the administration for a more rigorous management of the absences of the students The data mining module allowed bringing to light abnormally weak correlations between the results obtained in modules of the same family \(data bases and information system, theory of the languages and compilation To mitigate these abnormalities, the implementation of inter-modular educational committees is recommended. These committees will group together teachers of these modules to compare the programs and the educational steps adopted, and to synchronize the contents and the methods of the educations IX  CONCLUSION In this paper, we are interested to design and implementation of a decisional tool, dedicated to analysis of pedagogical results, for improvement of higher education quality. The first version of our tool permits the use of OLAP operators to analyse marks through different axis. It also provides a data mining module based on associative rules discovery, to check association between the marks obtained in different pedagogical modules We consider that this work contribute to propose answers to the questions relative to the factors of failure and success of the students. Although some of these factors -such as the social situation of the students- are not controllable, it is possible to act on the others so as to maximize the chances of success of the students Our tool can be to use as support of help to the decisionmaking, for the improvement of the quality of education in the university As perspective of our work, we suggest to extend the data mining module by exploiting other techniques of data mining such as neurones nets A CKNOWLEDGMENT  We want to thank all the project team and particularly the students R.

This is indeed a revolutionary concept in the fields of exploration and development of petroleum fields, which has more future scope of commercial research 2 Data instances from CDP, COP, CRP, CSP dimensions can easily be structured and integrated in a warehouse environment for the purpose of interpreting seismic signals and their attributes as required by geologists, well planners, reservoir and production engineers 3 Framing of business rules, constraints among usage of attributes within th e integration process and design of business rules have definite impact on correlation and mapping and thus on data mining 4 Ontology based data structuring has definite advantage, especially when attributes and their relationships are conceptualized using appropriate semantics and contexts 5 Integrating on tologically structured data in a warehousing environment has more flexibility and consistency in attribute mapping and interpretation during data mining stage 6 Structural data views taken from implemented warehoused metadata fo llow definite structure shapes, in terms of seismic high and low data instances, depicting geological knowledge 7 Integration of exploratio n data, modeled from different hierarchically derived multiple dimensions; facilitate the data mining process thus extracting knowledge of commercial petroleum plays. Issues of reuse and interoperability of denormalized fine-grained exploration data structures have also been emphasized in the context of implementing ontology based warehousing in petroleum exploration industries This research work addresses new methodologies, which have the potential to revolutionize the exploration and resources industries worldwide This is an on-going commercial research work at Curtin Business School Curtin University of Tech nology, Au stralia.

Table 1 the TREC model only outperformed the ONTO model by 0.002 0.5 in macro F 1 and 0.001 0.2 in micro F 1  The two models achieved almost the same performance The evaluation result is promising The statistical test is also performed on the experimental results in order to analyze the evaluation's reliability As suggested by we use the Student's Paired T-Test for the signi\002cance test The null hypothesis in our T-Test is that no difference exists in two comparing models When two tests produce substantially low p-value usually  0.05 the null hypothesis can be rejected In contrast when two tests produce high p-value usually  0.1 there is not or just little practical difference between two models The T-Test results are also presented on Table 1 The pvalue s show that there is no evidence of signi\002cant difference between two experimental models as the produced pvalue s are quite high  p-value 0.484\(MAP 0.862\(macroFM and 0.896\(micro-FM far greater than 0.1 Thus we can conclude that in terms of statistics our proposed model has the same performance as the golden TREC model and the evaluation result is reliable The advantage of the TREC model is that the experimental topics and the training sets are generated by the same linguists manually They as users perfectly know their information needs and what they are looking for in the training sets Therefore it is reasonable that the TREC model performed better than the ONTO model as we cannot expect that a computational model could outperform a such perfect manual model However the knowledge contained in TREC model's training sets is well formed for human beings to understand but not for computers The contained knowledge is not mathematically formalized and speci\002ed The ONTO model on the other hand formally speci\002es the user background knowledge and the related semantic relations using the world knowledge base and local instance repositories The mathematic formalizations are ideal for computers to understand This leverages the performance of the ONTO model As a result as shown on Fig 2 and Table 1 the ONTO model achieved almost the same performance as that of the TREC model 6 Conclusions In this paper an ontology-based knowledge IR framework is proposed aiming to discover a user's background knowledge to improve IR performance The framework consists of a user's mental model a querying model a computer model and an ontology model A world knowledge base is used by the computer model to construct an ontology to simulate a user's mental model and the ontology is personalized by using the user's local instance repository The semantic relations of hypernym/hyponym holonym/meronym and synonym are speci\002ed in the ontology model The framework is successfully evaluated by comparing to a manual user model The ontology-based framework is a novel contribution to knowledge engineering and Web information retrieval References   C Buckley and E M Voorhees Evaluating evaluation measure

support pruning gene expression classifier with an accurate and compact fuzzy rule base for microarray data analysis Biosystems vol 85 computationally challenging As training set sizes increase it is likely that these difficulties will also increase VI RELATED WORK While operating on a microarray dataset current CAR 1 2 3 4 and other pattern/rule 20 21 mining algorithms perform a pruned and/or compacted exponential search over either the space of gene subsets or the space of sample subsets Hence they are generally quite computationally expensive for datasets containing many training samples or genes as the case may be BSTC is explicitly related to CAR-based classifiers but requires no expensive CAR mining BSTC is also related to decision tree-based classifiers such as random forest 19 and C4.5 family 9 methods It is possible to represent any consistent set of boolean association rules as a decision tree and vice versa However it is generally unclear how the trees generated by current tree-based classifiers are related to high confidence/support CARs which are known to be particularly useful for microarray data 1 2 6 7 11 BSTC is explicitly related to and motivated by CAR-based methods To the best of our knowledge there is no previous work on mining/classifying with BARs of the form we consider here Perhaps the work closest to utilizing 100 BARs is the TOPRULES 22 miner TOP-RULES utilizes a data partitioning technique to compactly report itemlgene subsets which are unique to each class set Ci Hence TOP-RULES discovers all 100 confident CARs in a dataset However the method must utilize an emerging pattern mining algorithm such as MBD-LLBORDER 23 and so generally isn't polynomial time Also related to our BAR-based techniques are recent methods which mine gene expression training data for sets of fuzzy rules 24 25 Once obtained fuzzy rules can be used for classification in a manner analogous to CARs However the resulting fuzzy classifiers don't appear to be as accurate as standard classification methods such as SVM 25 VII CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK To address the computational difficulties involved with preclassification CAR mining see Tables IV and VI we developed a novel method which considers a larger subset of CAR-related boolean association rules BARs These rules can be compactly captured in a Boolean Structure Table BST which can then be used to produce a BST classifier called BSTC Comparison to the current leading CAR classifier RCBT on several benchmark microarray datasets shows that BSTC is competitive with RCBT's accuracy while avoiding the exponential costs incurred by CAR mining see Section VB Hence BSTC extends generalized CAR based methods to larger datasets then previously practical Furthermore unlike other association rule-based classifiers BSTC easily generalizes to multi-class gene expression datasets BSTC's worst case per-query classification time is worse then CAR-based methods after all exponential time CAR mining is completed O SlS CGl versus O Si CGi As future work we plan on investigating techniques to decrease this cost by carefully culling BST exclusion lists ACKNOWLEDGM[ENTS We thank Anthony K.H
