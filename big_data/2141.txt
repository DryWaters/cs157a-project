Generally a technical baseline includes ground rules and assumptions, a detailed technical description of system characteristics, configuration, quality factors, security, its operational concept, and the risks associated with the system.  Often a description of the system\222s \(or the project\222s\ilestones, schedule, management strategy implementation/deployment plan, test strategy, security considerations, and acquisition strategy are also included Given the nature of these technical inputs, how can a traditional technical baseline be applied to non-engineering projects and still be relevant and useful The goal of this paper is to demonstrate how the technical baseline concept and procedure was successfully applied to two non-engineering projects at the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory \(JPL\wo projects were Acquisition Process Improvement \(API\x Sigma \(LSS focused project, and Unified Messaging System \(UMS\an Information Technology \(IT oject transitioning all 7,000 JPL mail client users from Eudora to Microsoft Outlook These projects were not run by engineers, nor were they highly technical in nature.

The benefits realized by using a technical baseline manifested through improved strategic customer communication customer expectation and change management, an understanding of cost and risk impacts, increased teamwork and process improvement efficiencies These two project examples and the technical baseline

B IOGRAPHY  7  1  I NTRODUCTION  The technical world in the engineering project management community understands that a technical baseline is the foundation for success on any majo r project.  The technical baseline is really a collection of information contained in documents, systems, and project reviews. This living information comes together for a snapshot in time as one technical baseline document at key decision points during the project lifecycle. This cornerstone of systems development is the official source of critical data that will be used by all project participants, provides the framework for the standard communication language of the project, and 
most importantly is the reference design where change is identified and controlled over the project lifecycle What is considered a non-engineering project The foundation of this paper is a discussion describing work on two non-engineering projects at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory \(JPL\wo projects were Acquisition Process Improvement \(API\x Sigma \(LSS focused project and Unified Messaging System \(UMS\an Information Technology \(IT oject transitioning all 7,000 JPL mail client users from Eudora to Microsoft Outlook While IT projects are technical in nature and require engineering discipline, the approach on non-flight IT projects is different than flight hardware, software, or other systems engineering projects as compared to smaller scale 
 


 2 non-flight, IT or process improvement projects.   One other key differentiator on IT projects is the skill mix of personnel on the project.  Non-flight IT projects often have programmers and other technical experts that do not have engineering or scientific training and therefore have the engineering discipline or an understanding of the necessary communication required for project success Process Improvement projects can involve technical subjects and do employ a structured approach to project management especially when using the Lean Six Sigma LSS\ness management strategy. The LSS approach employs quality management and statistical methods providing discipline to the analysis but not always to the overall management of the project.  A technical baseline can help a LSS project baseline the parameters and scope of the project and document progress or revisions as they occur Technical Baseline Attributes This paper reviews some attributes of using a technical baseline on a traditional engineering project and how it is used to communicate between the engineers and others estimating the project, for those reviewing the project, or for others needing to access a comm on set of project technical information for their portion of a related project Traditional engineering projects document their baseline early in the project lifecycle in a series of documents that become the project technical baseline and the cornerstone for systems development.  As the project progresses changes to the baseline are r ecorded as Revisions to the Technical Baseline document The three major attributes of a technical baseline, initial project snapshot, technical parameters, and communication of project evolution through revisions, are discussed in the following section.  A brief discussion follows of a technical baseline on a systems engineering project focusing on technical parameters, operational concepts, risks, and tests The last sections discussion the components of the two nonengineering projects and the introduction of a technical baseline to the project 2  W HAT IS A T ECHNICAL B ASELINE AND W HY IS IT I MPORTANT    Many of my engineering associates don't think of the technical baseline as a single document at all, but instead have a vivid image of the real space system they are trying to build or have built. Perhaps they take a developer\222s perspective and are thinking about the design that came out of spacecraft design review, not just a piece of paper but a vision of the spacecraft itself as captured in real hardware and software \(or engineering development units\backed up by a stack of detailed subsystem and interface specifications. On the other hand my associates in project management may be thinking of the technical baseline as his or her top-level Government requirements and systems specifications, and as just one more significant item to juggle to keep the project moving forward, while he deals with contracts, budgets, managing the team of engineers scientists, and technicians needed to design, build, and fly it, and maintaining program advocacy and support from NASA Headquarters and Capitol Hill Since most large or technically complex space systems developments continue to evolve throughout their life cycle as new challenges and opportunities appear, \(or as they follow planned strategies for evolution such as Ares I to Ares V\y associates also tend think of the technical baseline as something that is a living collection of tools and documents and designs that come together and then evolve during the development of a major system But no matter what the size or complexity of a development project, there are several point s in the project\222s life where the technical baseline must be captured in a cornerstone document that forms the basis of cost estimation. It is really a project snapshot in time and is vital for communication cost estimating, independent reviews, proper resource allocation, and ultimately project success.  The technical baseline is actually the first and single snapshot of one technical document and supporting documents referenced usually at the beginning of a project when the scope and initial ground rules are determ ined.  The purpose of the technical baseline is a snaps hot document of the technical parameters to establish the starting point for the project The technical documentation will evolve as the project proceeds and the changes that result from this evolution are captured in Revisions \(Rev 1, Rev 2, etc.\o the technical baseline.  The initial technical baseline is not dynamic and as a result provides a tool for change control and a point of reference against which later re visions can be compared for determining delta-cost and delta-schedule impacts that result from requirement changes in the scope of the project 3  T RADITIONAL T ECHNICAL B ASELINE ON A S YSTEMS E NGINEERING P ROJECT  The project technical baseline describes the project in common terms to be used by the project team and independent cost estimators. The example used here is for a complex spacecraft project, wh ere the project technical baseline descriptive information normally begins with system goals and success cr iteria, including what key scientific answers the project seeks to find.  The technical baseline often includes a number of diagrams to clarify the intent, including trajectories, configuration and process diagrams, the launch system, or payload subsystems.  These diagrams describe  System characteristics and configuration  Key design factors  Operational concepts 
 


 3  Risks  In addition to the technical di agrams, the technical baseline also describes the  Key Technical Parameters  Management strategy  Acquisition Strategy  Major Product Milestones  Schedule  Implementation plan  Test Strategy  Other considerations such as security, international cooperation, or environmental issues are also addressed The document is organized in a way that conforms to the approved project work breakdown structure to ensure no element of the project is missed The technical baseline describes post-launch and cruise portions of the mission, including key assumptions, specific dates, vehicle maneuvers and on-board operations, along with any unique design requirements or special redundancy features.  It describes the entry, descent, landing, and surface operation portions of the mission Figure 1  3  below displays components of the Saturn 1B Service Module as one of the many diagrams and technical descriptions that would be found in the project technical baseline.  While this is not a recent project for illustrative purposes it demonstrates the type of technical information that is found in a traditional engineering proj ect technical baseline  Figure 1: Saturn IB Service Module  3 OffLoading Block II SPS Components fo r Saturn IB Missions," June 15 1965 On a spacecraft engineering pr oject, the technical baseline includes an overview of the sp acecraft vehicle configuration and the launch vehicle, in cluding assumptions. Spacecraft bus subsystems are each described in detail. For each one the development risk is put in context by a description of heritage, design assumptions, and technology readiness levels \(TRLs\It summarizes the structural subsystem for each element, including key features and interfaces, and makes special note of any deploy able structural items such as booms, masts, and mobility subsystems. Each of the other systems are described in detail, including the propulsion subsystem, thermal control subsystem, power subsystem, avionics subsystem, telecommunications subsystem, attitude and control subsystem, and software subsystems \(including the computer software configuration items\ission operations system/ground data system is also described in detail, including a description of how each facility will be procured, managed, and operated.  The technical baseline also has a detailed description of each individual payload instrument, its capability and scientific goals, and how it will be operated The technical baseline also describes the project itself referencing the Project Management Plan and the Systems Engineering Plan, beginning with project management oversight, lines of authority, structure, roles, and responsibilities, including an organization chart and a project level schedule.  Project systems engineering responsibilities are addressed in cluding lead or responsible organizations, level one requirements and mission success criteria, launch approval, and planetary protection. The baseline describes the science team structure and responsibilities, mission assurance management with verification and validation education and public outreach assembly test and launch operations and test beds, risk assessment, acquisition strategy, government funded equipment, and any significant changes since the previous technical baseline submission 4  T ECHNICAL B ASELINE A DJUSTMENTS FOR N ON E NGINEERING P ROJECTS  The motivation for using a technical baseline on a nonengineering project is to introduce the same discipline and benefits of a technical baseline to a team that is largely unfamiliar with the process.  Using the technical baseline is more than just a project management technique.  It provides more factual, quantifiable key parameters to be used for successful criteria of non-engineering projects.  These key parameters and using the rigor of the technical baseline can increase communication and reduce scope growth.  Unlike a Project Plan that mostly covers project schedules, budget and deliverables, the techni cal baseline focuses on the technical parameters, operational concepts, risks, and tests This information documented in one specific place becomes an invaluable tool for the team beyond the basics of the project management.  If necessa ry the technical baseline can 
 


 4 also be introduced after the project has been initiated and as the technical details are agreed upon.  In the following two project examples, one techni cal baseline was introduced after the project had been initiated.  The other was used from project inception.  While th e technical baseline is more effective when introduced from the start it can still be an effective tool introduced later the basic principles of the technical baseline are observed Adjustments to the Technical Baseline When considering using a technical baseline on a nonengineering project, adjustments must be made to accommodate the lack of engineering data available on the project and to translate to useful parameters for the nonengineering project.  Minor adjustments include areas such as basic project management data which will be similar regardless of the project but may not be as detailed on a non-engineering project.  The major adjustments that need to be made when developing a technical baseline on a nonengineering project are summari zed in Table 1 below.  The major parameter found in a traditional technical baseline is listed in the first column and the adjustment made for a nonengineering project is described in the second column Table 1: Major Technica l Baseline Adjustments Traditional Technical Baseline Parameter Non-Engineering Technical Baseline Adjustment System characteristics configuration Project characteristics including any technical descriptions as appropriate and configuration for test and implementation Key design factors Key success factors for the project outcome, critical areas of the project implementation approach, and if the project is technical in nature, any design factors or specific hardware or software data Operational concepts The operational concepts post implementation are discussed regardless of the type of project Risks Risks are important to identify, discuss impact, and define mitigations regardless of the project type Management strategy Management strategy is important to discuss regardless of the project type Acquisition strategy Acquisition strategy is important to discuss regardless of the project type Major project milestones Major project milestones are important to discuss regardless of the project type Schedule Schedule should match the project plan and should be appropriate regardless of project type Implementation plan The implementation plan for the project is important to be documented in relation to the schedule and risks Test strategy Test strategy can be discussed in terms of technical parameters if applicable or as test cases for the project communication strategy  Establishing the Technical Baseline Once the necessary adjustments are understood the next step is to establish the technical baseline.  If the project is in a startup phase this is an appropriate time to use the technical baseline parameters to plan and document the initial project in terms of technical parameters, operational concepts, risks and tests.  Once this data is baselined the technical baseline document becomes an authorita tive source of data where scope, cost, and schedule deviations can be captured through revisions and communicated to the project team At the end of the project it is also an excellent source of controlled data to determine the cause of program delays overruns, or specific changes to the project design in technical terms or quantifiable metrics depending on the project  If the project is in midstream the reason for a technical baseline implementation most likely has to do with problems already identified with the project rather than an attempt for good project management practices and technical discipline.  In this case it becomes important to determine where your baseline activity will start, from the original program start or the current program position.  If starting from the original start of the program it is important not to confuse the current program position in the baseline It is also important to quickly document the first revision of the document to communicate curre nt snapshot of where the program is now.  If there is time to conduct this full activity the insights gained between the initial technical baseline and revision 1 may allow the project to understand some of the areas where increased planning, communication, risk management, or testing will be necessary for improvement  Controlling the Technical Baseline Controlling the technical baseline can require more attention on a non-engineering project.  To use this technical baseline tool effectively the control process becomes more than better documentation of a freely changing configuration.  A single organization should be responsible for the documentation of the technical baseline, controlling any 
 


 5 changes to the technical ba seline, and communicating the approved changes in subsequent revisions of the document Focusing on the key areas of a technical baseline, the technical parameters, operational concepts, risks, and tests are the areas that should be continuously evaluated for quantifiable changes.  If these areas are monitored and changes controlled and communicated through a formal process the technical baselin e becomes the authoritative source for technical data on th e project and an excellent measure of the progress and changes at the end of the project 5  I NFORMATION T ECHNOLOGY P ROJECT T ECHNICAL B ASELINE I MPLEMENTATION  The Information Technology \(IT\ where the technical baseline concept was implemented was the Unified Messaging System \(UMS\S is an IT project that transitioned all 7,000 JPL electronic mail client users from the Eudora mail client to Microsoft Outlook Exchange. When I joined the project it was already underway and had been operating with a high-level project management plan that included a schedule and deliverables Roles and responsibilities, tec hnical parameters, risks and mitigations and test protocols had not been defined.  Most of these items were recognized as activities that would take place at some point in the pr oject but were not documented or planned.  Figure 2 below is a sample diagram from the JPL UMS Communication Plan.  It is a diagram of the JPL UMS system and with the exception of some software builds and version documentation was the most technical part of the documentation.  Needless to say there were many other more technical parameters, activities, and tests that needed to be documented and communicated to the team  Figure 2: JPL Unified Messaging System Diagram IT Projects have similarities with large-scale engineering projects such as space systems because of their technical nature, large stakeholder base, and need for test and redundancy.  Unfortunately IT projects are managed like an average work project and the t echnical parameters that are so important to all of the st akeholders are treated as an afterthought.  The UMS project was no exception after the first five months of operation.  We immediately recognized that the project was struggling mostly with stakeholder communication, an authoritativ e source for technical data and a test plan to avoid rework and mitigate risks By implementing the technical baseline concept we had used so often on space programs and other large scale engineering projects our team was able to bring discipline back to the project in a few ke y areas that helped bring the whole project around and heading in the right direction Some of the most positive results from the technical baseline documentation were ar eas where discipline in the approach and execution were critical to success and controlling scope creep and rework.   The top three areas with positive results are listed here and described further in this section  Stakeholder Communication  Authoritative Source for Technical Data  Test Plan  Five months into the project communication between stakeholders had broken down in some critical areas such as implementation and training and was non-existent in other areas such as test planning.  Exacerbating the communication issue was the lack of an authoritative source for Technical Data for the stake holders to use.  As a result when communication did occur and decisions were made there was no mechanism to eith er reference the baseline to ensure scope compliance or make note of the revision to the baseline and documentation of any impacts to the scope change.  The test plan was another critical area that had difficulty gaining momentum until a technical baseline was implemented and the team had a common set of parameters to plan for in their test system and test scenario preparation If these three areas had not had a common baseline for the project to work from, to document revisions, and to use for communication the project would have continued to drift and been at major risk of extreme cost and schedule growth  Stakeholder Communication One of the most important lessons learned from the benefit of implementing a technical baseline on the UMS project was using it as a communication vehicle within the project team and to project stake holders.  Once the system characteristics, key design factors risks, and test plans were documented in one baseline all of the stakeholders had a place to go first to answer ques tions or take issue with a parameter.  The technical team had a place to document their plans and changes through the revision control process where everyone else on the t echnical team could see the changes and use it as an authoritative source.  The clients could use the technical base line to communicate concerns desired changes, or insight into risk mitigation or changes 
 


 6 The users and other stakeholders were able to use the technical baseline to communi cate concerns or parameter changes they needed so the sy stem was interoperable with other systems.  In the end this was probably the single greatest benefit of the technical baseline documentation \226 an authoritative document providing all of the technical, risk and test parameters in one place to facilitate communication among all stakeholders Authoritative Source for Technical Data As mentioned previously, the importance of an authoritative source for technical data cannot be underestimated Unfortunately too often on IT projects, the IT parameters risk assessment and mitigations, and test strategies remain in the hands, heads, or hard drives of the technicians.  When these individuals come together to document and agree on the technical parameters for the system it helps everyone.  A common technical baseline provides the framework for this collaboration and documentation to take place.  It also allows the team and the clients to look at the technical information differently and translate the big picture into other consequences, mitigate risks, understand cost and schedule impacts, and plan for testing. Most importantly having a set baseline allows control of requirements and scope changes and a mechanism for comparison after project completion.  Rather than an ever changing and drifting IT system where victory would eventually be declared and the system operational, we now had a set baseline for decision making and project metrics.  When a change was considered it could be measured in relation to the requirements, impact, risk, cost and schedule and appropriate action could be taken and a revision to the baseline documented.  Changes that were deemed out of scope could be documented a nd prioritized for another phase of the project, allowing focus to resume on the critical path to completion Until we joined the team five months into the UMS implementation process there was no common source where the technical team could r ecord their information requirements and scope changes and associated impacts Once the framework was created for the technical baseline interviews were conducted to populate the data, and communication sessions were conducted to ensure everyone understood the document, it became useful. Knowing that the data was accurate and that the technical team was relying on the data to communi cate with each other, develop interoperable systems, and plan for future tests, the technical baseline became an authoritative source for UMS data for the team and the client Test Plan Once the project team had a complete set of technical parameters, a technical baseline document to use to communicate with clients, and an area where risks were identified, test became the next focus.  A solid test plan is critical to ensuring timely IT project implementation and acceptance.  A system that has not been properly tested can still be implemented but risk will undermine client confidence and implementation delays if issues surface later The technical baseline allowed the UMS team to articulate the UMS test plans, schedules, and requirements and communicate them to all users In addition the test team was also able to take into account potential risk areas where mitigation options should be identified and tested as alternatives.  The UMS program went from a \223test when it\222s done\224 plan to a detailed and incr emental test plan that was responsive to the client concerns as they were raised or as issues were uncovered The UMS technical baseline allowed the entire team and stakeholders to have an open book on the UMS technical parameters and implementation plan in a way that was more effective than the average project plan.  The simple technical tables of authoritative data generated discussion questions, and ultimately a bette r product.  The discussions generated improved communication with the client and helped to manage expectations for final delivery.  In the end all of the things that project managers think comes naturally on a project team were brought together in an effective and fact based way through the technical baseline to achieve solid results for the UMS program 6  P ROCESS I MPROVEMENT P ROJECT L ESSONS L EARNED  The JPL Acquisition Process Improvement program was even less technical than the JPL UMS implementation.  The basis for the process improvement is Lean Six Sigma and the intent is to improve processes in the Acquisition Division on non-engineering initiativ es at JPL.  Other than statistics from metrics or surveys there was little data resulting in anything resembling technical information on this project The advantage was being able to implement the technical baseline on this project from the start.  While much of the project was not technical, there was still a Project Charter for the overall Acquisition Process Improvement Lean Six Sigma Implementation, and a project plan that included a schedule, selected LSS projects, and the original project Statement of work.  From these supporting documents a technical baseline for the overall project that included technical parameters, operational concepts, risks, and tests was created.  Technical Parameters in this case were adjusted to be program objec tives and success metrics for the overall program.  Operational concepts were important to document in the case of the API LSS program as much of the programs success focused on change management during the implementation phase of the LSS initiative.  Risk is not often documented in the context of a LSS program Risks to the API LSS program were documented in the 
 


 7 technical baseline which has proven useful as a proactive management and communication tool for risk management Test is another unusual area for a LSS program to evaluate and baseline.  In this case test became protocol and metrics for stakeholder communication, change management, and limited tests for LSS implementations.  These adjustments from a traditional technical baseline to the API LSS technical baseline were usef ul for the project team communication and for revision tracking back to the baseline to measure program progress and success Given this project construct the technical baseline was documented in a MS Power Point document.  The document is shown in Figure 3 below  Figure 3: API LSS Project Technical Baseline Working with process improvement experts and Lean Six Sigma Black Belts, the projects are always well organized and often well communicated.  So how did the practices from a technical baseline help the project?  The technical baseline concepts were introduced to provide more detail to the project plan and help as a communication vehicle to API stakeholders Unlike a traditional project plan the technical baseline was a companion document that provided an additional level of detail with the project implementation plans, the critical success factors, metrics that would be measured, potential risks, and any early test cases for the process improvement and their results.  This information was available to all stakeholders and project leads which provided an authoritative source of measurable data that went beyond the project schedule.  This allowed the stakeholders to participate at a deeper level and provide comments at early and critical points in the proj ect lifecycle.  The technical baseline also became a communication vehicle for the project team to communicate progress, results and changes to their stakeholders which was important in light of the many mini-projects taking place concurrently on a LSS program.  This baseline allows for overall program tracking and adjustments rather than only focusing on individual initiatives which has become continuous source of lessons learned feedback to improve future projects under the API LSS project 7  C ONCLUSIONS  The technical baseline approach provided a team unfamiliar with large scale engineer ing projects with a common baseline for their projects.  For both UMS and API the participants gained a solid vehicle that improved communication, became an authoritative source for technical information, and allowed for risk mitigation and test planning R EFERENCES    2232004 NASA C o st Est i m at i ng Handbook \(C EH  www.ceh.nasa.gov  223NPR 7120.5 NASA Space Flight Program and Project  Management Requirements\224   M e m o randum  Owen E.

Discussion and Conclusions  This study examined factors influencing organization assimilation of information technology in the context of Korean local governments. Of particular interests was the influence of organizational culture and types of knowledge on assimilation. The result of this study can be summarized as follows First, centralization is negatively associated with assimilation of IT. It seems that structural perspective on organizational innovation has been upheld again by this study Second, rational organizational culture is positively associated with assimilation of IT. As Debabroto et al. \(2002 assimilation of IT could be regarded as a cumulative result of actions by individuals and units within the 


result of actions by individuals and units within the organization. These actions of assimilation, in turn are stimulated or discouraged by an organizational milieu of norms, values, and rules. To the extent that assimilation of IT lies in the arena of rational choice of individuals, organizations may be able to foster assimilation by providing appropriate incentives Third, the quality of information resource management is positively associated with organizational assimilation of IT. The capacity of IT department in providing end-user support and enduser participation in IT project planning continue to Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6   be important in promoting the organizational assimilation of IT   6.

managed. Although the provided methodology is flexible with respect to the level of detail, the decision to develop highly detailed RPBBs causes higher efforts for documenting processes. Further refinements of the methodology could address this issue by identifying typical sequences of components patterns basis of a semantic standardization of RPBBs using the comprehensive basis of 200 process models for the public sector. Consequently, such patterns will enable standardization of process fragments, too, and support a more efficient modeling \(cp. analogy-based construction [14 identification of typical process patterns is required Concluding previous discussions, the main strength of RPBB-based process documentation is the semantic standardization of models. This not only enables distributed modeling by heterogeneous user groups but also allows for the automation of analyses such as pattern-based mechanisms for plausibility and consistency check, performance measurement identification of organizational weaknesses and potentials for optimization \(organizational technology-driven, etc into other \(e.g. more technical or user-dependent notations and views [26]. However, automation approaches obviously require technical support Hence, a realization in form of a web-based prototype is currently progressing. On the one hand this prototype supports distributed process modeling with RPBBs implementing the idea of stepwise specialization via dynamic dialogues \(guided modeling semantic reasoning enables the pattern-based identification of organizational deficiencies weaknesses technologies The prototypical implementation allows for flexible modifications of existing RPBBs and for the extension with additional RPBBs and weakness pattern. It enables comprehensive testing and evaluation of the described approaches. Furthermore it supports the transfer of the developed methodologies to other domains and further associated adaptations and refinements. The underlying methodological foundation and the prototypical implementation thereby represent a rigorous as well as relevant contribution to the field of collaborative process modeling 6.
