Survey data were collected from shoppers of two supermarkets in Beijing, China. The results show that consumersê characteristic of extraversion is positively related to the level of accrued loyalty, while consumerês characteristic of neuroticism attenuates the association between customer satisfaction and loyalty. Implications for managers in the retail context are also discussed   Key words extraversion, neuroticism, customer satisfaction, loyalty  1. INTRODUCTION 1   The antecedent-consequence association between customer satisfaction and loyalty has drawn attentions in the past three decades. Organizations in service industry have invested heavily in efforts to gain customer satisfaction that underpins loyalty, which in turn, lead to the long term profitability of the firms. There is a general belief in industry that customer satisfaction is positively related to loyalty, whereas their association rule may vary across product category and under differentiated market environment  Factors such as personal characteristics 2 variety seeking, innovation, and relationship proneness 3 switching cost or barriers to exit 5 prior experience and past behavior  have demonstrated in literature their roles as the moderator in the link of customer satisfaction and loyalty  Explicit consumer characteristics like demographics assume the center of study in previous researches exploring the moderating effects of personal characteristics. However, the implicit parts of personality also matter in evoking consumer needs and demands Many articles in the extant body of literature have demonstrated that an individualês extraversion or neuroticism qualities will affect his or her sense of satisfaction and choice behavior 7-9 Thus, these traits may also affect his or her judgment on how customer satisfaction is associated with loyalty  The purpose of this study is to investigate the moderating role of personality in the relationship between customer satisfaction and loyalty in the retail context. The supermarket sector is characteristized by intensive   Corresponding author: Shuo-Chang Tsai is with the Department of Business Administration, Asia University, Taichung, Taiwan  Phone: +886-926-272-572; fax: +886-423-321-157 This project is supported by Grant No. Asia University 98-NSC-14  competition and voltile market situation. Satisfaction as a main driver of excellent customer ralationship allows the strategy formulation and execution of satisfaction management to become the top priority 10 What makes this study distinct from others is the approach where both the relationship between personality and customer satisfaction/loyalty and which traits greatly influence this association are investigated. The remianing parts of this paper are organized as follows. The next section presents the literaturer review outcome of customer-loyalty links and personality effects just mentioned, also included is the conceptual model proposed in this study. The research design and the method to verify the hypothesises are described in the third section. The fourth section contains the results of hierarchical regression analsis. Finally, we present the discussion on the basis of research findings for managerial implications and draw the conclusion  2. LITERATURE REVIEW  2.1 Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty  Scholar indicated that consumers in fact demand channel to come up with six service outputs: bulking-braking spatial convenience, shorter waiting time, product assortment, customer services, and information provision 1 Among them product quality and service quality account for what entice customers to make contribution to the operational performance of a channel store 12  given the supermarket offers a variety of products and complementary services. Past studies have set perceived product and service quality as predictors of customer satisfaction that has indirect positive effect on loyalty 12  For the service industry where intensive competition is a way of life, firms compete on how they can enhance customersê satisfaction so as to retain them, in anticipation of securing customer loyalty manifested by repeat purchase. Previous researches already indicated 978-1-4244-6487-6/10/$26.00  2010 IEEE 


 the significant relevance of customer satisfaction with loyalty, assuming loyal customers will buy more, be less price sensitive, and are willing to act as enthusiastic advocates for their preferable firms 13 Although empirical evidences of this relationship are mixed 1 it is well recognized that customer satisfaction is positively correlated with loyalty 5 The higher level of satisfaction consumers reach toward a product or service provider the more likelihood customers demonstrate their behavioral loyalty 4 Thus, we assume that  H 1 Product quality has positive influence on customer loyalty H 2 Service quality has positive influence on customer loyalty H 3 Customer satisfaction has positive influence on customer loyalty  2.2 Personality Effects  Personality is a psychographic variable which plays important role in the domain of psychological behavior research. In the fields of marketing and consumer behavior, a large proportion of studies are devoted in the forecasting of product uses or choices taking into account of personality or lifestyle traits 14 Personality refers to certain persistent qualities in human behavior 15 According to the Freudian theory and learning theory the personality traits dominate the individual choice and behavior 14-16 Personality characteristics of an individual will affect their subjective well-being 8 job satisfaction 17 emotion and customer satisfaction 7   In this study, we select the extraversion and neuroticism out of the Big-Five Factor Model for their well-established properties, and analyze their influence on customer satisfaction and loyalty. Extraversion is distinguished by venturesomeness, affiliation, positive affectivity, energy, ascendance and ambition, while neuroticism represents distress, nervous tension depression, guilt, low self-esteem, poor control of impulses and somatic complaints 7 An individuals attitude and behavior are characterized by their personality traits. Extraversion characteristics of an individual will positively influence their brand affect and ecological behavior 16 Extraversion is positively correlated with subjective well-being, whereas neuroticism is negatively correlated with subjective well-being 8 Personality trait of neuroticism effects negative emotions whereas extraversion effects positive emotions 7 Thus, we can infer that extraversion is positively related with positive emotion that engenders customer satisfaction, while neuroticism is negatively related with the two constructs. Hence, based on the associations between customer satisfaction and loyalty we make the hypotheses that  H 4 Extraversion is positively correlated with loyalty H 5 Neuroticism is negatively correlated with loyalty  Investigation in how extraversion and neuroticism as moderators of the relationship between customer satisfaction and loyalty is a less-visited area Nevertheless, extraverts are more likely to desire a relational orientation and positive thinking 19 The relationship orientation, in turn, may be positively related to customer satisfaction and loyalty 20 In addition consumers with greater relationship proneness tend to exhibit a stronger relationship between relationship quality and behavioral loyalty 3 Thus, consumers with extraversion characteristics are apt to develop affinity with certain brand given experiencing satisfaction via acts done by the service provider, whereas consumers with neuroticism characteristics would experience lower levels of attachment when experiencing satisfaction acts done by the service provider 22 Research in job satisfaction also revealed that extraversion will moderate the relationship between perceived procedural fairness social rewards, and employee job attitudes 23 Therefore we will investigate the moderating effect of extraversion and neuroticism in the context of retail environment, and hypothesize that   H 6 The stronger the customerês extraversion personality the stronger influence on the relationship between customer satisfaction and loyalty H 7 The stronger the customerês neuroticism personality the weaker influence on the relationship between customer satisfaction and loyalty  Our proposed conceptual framework is shown as the model in Figure 1. The model predicts positive effect of extroversion and negative effect of neuroticism on loyalty. It is in line with prior research suggesting the main effects of customer satisfaction, perceived product quality and perceived service quality. The interactions between personality traits and customer satisfaction are also shown in the model    Figure 1 Proposed model in this study  3.

 behaviors toward the supermarket store patronized most often is used to test the model. The economics growth in China advances rapidly enough to attract the entry of multinational supermarket retailers such as Carrefour Wal-Mart, and Metro. They compete against domestic supermarket retail chains like Wumart and Jingkelong in the urban regions. Shoppers of Carrefour and Wumart were selected for interview. Data was collected by intercept method in the vicinity of these two stores in Beijing. A marketing research agency was entrusted to conduct the survey. Those who are below 18 years old were not allowed to participate in the survey. The structure of the questionnaire includes the objective of the survey, specific indicators of product quality, service quality, customer satisfaction and loyalty, personality trait and demographics of the respondents. In November 2009, 400 consumers in total have been engaged in the survey, with 200 respondents for each store respectively We did away with 29 pieces of Carrefour and 28 pieces of Wumart response questionnaire due to their incompleteness or inconsistency. Thus, the final effective sample size was 343 with a response rate of 85.8  3.2 Measurement  All constructs were measured by incumbent and tested scales extracted from the literature. The scales of product quality, service quality, customer satisfaction and loyalty were adopted from the scales measuring customer satisfaction in the retail environment 10, 13 Six statements were taken from Costa and McCrae 25  measuring the personality traits of extraversion and neuroticism. All question items were evaluated on a five-point Likert scale rangin g from çstrongly disagree to çstrongly degree   3.3 Demographics  The demographics for each sample are presented in Table 1. On the total sample statistics, female consumers answered most of the survey instruments, accounting for 68.5% of the respondents. The sample was approximately equally distributed across age, and a large portion of the samples were middle class citizens with the income of less than 4,000 RMB/month and without college graduates. About 50% of correspondents in the sample frame bought at these supermarkets 4 to 6 times a month. The sample was nearly consistent across the two supermarkets. However, on the average, shoppers of Wumart stores are senior to and less educated than those of Carrefour stores  3.4 Factor Analysis  Factor analysis was conducted on the two samples combined. Consistent with the underlying theory, the number of factors to be retained was specified to six factors and a varimax method was performed since they are believed to be correlated. Based on the exploratory factor analysis, two items from product quality, two items from service quality, one item from customer satisfaction, and one item from loyalty were dropped due to poor factor loadings or cross loadings. The six factors explained 63.1% of the variance and were exhibited in Table 2, where LO=loyalty, CS=customer satisfaction SQ=service quality, PQ=product quality EX=extraversion, and NE=neuroticism. Value of Cronbachês alpha for each construct was also calculated in Table 2. The value of coefficient for extraversion product quality, and neuroticism did not exceed the general accepted criterion of 0.7. Taking into account that the value of coefficient is affected by the sample size and number of items, we used the means of each construct in the following analysis to test the proposed model  Table 1 Demographic characteristics of the sample Variable Carrefour  Wumart  Total  Gender Male 33.9 29.1 31.5 Female 66.1 70.9 68.5 Age 30 26.3 20.9 23.6 31-40 28.1 17.4 22.7 41- 50 17.5 16.9 17.2 50 28.1 44.8 36.4 Education <=high school 33.9 47.1 40.5 college 32.7 26.2 29.4 university 33.3 26.7 30.0 Monthly Individual Income 2,000 RMB 25.7 32.6 29.2 2,000-4,000 RMB 45.6 43.6 44.6 4,000-6,000 RMB 18.7 14.0 16.3 6,000 RMB 9.9 9.9 9.9 Purchase Frequency 1-3 times a month 19.9 12.8 16.3 4-6 times a month 49.1 43.6 46.4 7-9 times a month 16.4 19.8 18.1 9 times a month 14.6 23.8 19.2  Table 2 Exploratory Factor Analysis   LOY SQ EX PQ CS NE Products quality is consistent    0.73   Products are safe to consume    0.72   Product pricing are reasonable    0.74   Store worker display goo d  attitude 0.70    Store workers are considerate  0.80     Company-wide pervasion 0.80    It is wise of me to shop here      0.79  I am satisfied with this store     0.82  I shop here as the first priority 0.64      I prefer product sold here tha n  any other store 0.64 I enjoy service offered here than any other stores 0.76 I will keep on shopping here 0.76      I am sociable   0.65    Sometimes I am a bit nervous      0.80 I can handle stress an d  pressure very well 0.69 I am communicative   0.80    I am confident   0.62    I am pessimistic and often worry too much 0.81 Variance Explained 12.91 11.65 11.21 9.95 9.17 8.21 Cronbachês Alpha 0.74 0.73 0.66 0.63 0.74 0.57 Factor loadings less than 0.4 not shown 


  3.5. Descriptive Statistics  The mean scores of the constructs were calculated as shown in Table 3. The mean scores on a 5-point scale are about 4 for loyalty, customer satisfaction, product quality and service quality, suggesting moderately positive evaluation of the supermarket patronized most often. The average ratings of personality traits are 4.03 for extraversion and 2.55 for neuroticism, implying the respondents feature distinctive outgoing personality  Table 3 also shows the correlations among the constructs As having been hypothesized, customer satisfaction product quality, service quality, and extraversion are positively correlated with loyalty. The negative relationship between neuroticism and loyalty, however, is not that significant. Customer satisfaction, product quality, and service quality are positively correlated while extraversion and neuroticism are negatively correlated, as previous literat ure so suggested   Table 3 Descriptive statistics of the variables   Mean Std LO CS PQ SQ EX LO 4.12 0.44 CS 4.05 0.39 0.50      PQ 4.05 0.42 0.25  0.28     SQ 3.94 0.53 0.26  0.19  0.35    EX 4.03 0.43 0.25  0.08 0.01 0.08  NE 2.55 0.71 -0.02 0.01 0.01 0.07 -0.21  p<0.01   4. EMPIRICAL RESULTS  Hierarchical regression analysis was used to test the hypothesis. In order to reduce multicollinearity between the main effect variables and their interaction terms, all main effect variables were mean centered prior to the creation of interaction terms 26 The data for the two supermarkets were analyzed combined together. A variable \(STORE\was created to reflect the two supermarkets with Wumart stores as reference group in this study. Three regression models were established. The first one included the direct effects of customer satisfaction, service quality and product quality. The difference of loyalty between Carrefour and Wumart was also illustrated in this model. The second model added the main effects of extraversion and neuroticism to analyze the role of these two variables in the formation of consumer loyalty. Finally, the model explored the interaction effects of personality traits and customer satisfaction. The three models were evaluated as table 4   Model 1 has shown, consistent with previous studies that customer satisfaction and service quality has significant positive impact on loyalty. H 1 and H 3 are supported. The positive effect of product quality however, is not proved in this study. A reasonable and plausible explaination is that products there are mainly low involvement goods for daily use, consumers rather pay more attention to the service in the retail environment, especially for the formation of purchase behavior or repurchase behavior. What is also salient lies in the inference that customer satisfaction may play a mediating role in the relationship between product quality and loyalty, since the correlation between the two variables is significantly positive as shown in Table 3 Hence, the direct effect of product quality on loyalty is not significant in this study, H 3 is not supported  Consumers dispaly a higher level of loyalty for Wumart stores than that for Carefour stores as the variable of STORE has significant negative impact on the dependent variable. A possible reason is that the age distribution of consumers are different between the two supermarkets As previously stated, Wumart are largely sponsored by senior consumers group who have limited information-processing capabilities and tend to stick to a store brand than the yonger group does 4   We added the main effects of extraversion and neuroticism in Model 2, and the R-squared value increased significantly. The coefficients of the two variables demonstrated that the main effect of extraversion is in place as it has significant positive impact on loyalty, Hypothesis 4 is supported. As opposed to hypothesis 5, neuroticism does not significantly affect customer loyalty  Table 4 Hierarchical regression results  Model 1 Model 2 Model 3 Constant 4.17** 4.16** 4.17 CS 0.50** 0.49** 0.50 PQ 0.08 0.08 0.09 SQ 0.13** 0.12** 0.11 STORE a  0.10* -0.09* -0.09 EX  0.20** 0.21 NE  -0.01 0.00 EX CS  0.12 NE CS  0.12 R 2 0.29 0.33 0.34 R 2 Change  0.04 0.01 p<0.01;*p<0.1 a, Wumart as refreence group   The moderating effect of these two personality traits were further analyzed in Model 3. Consistent with Hypothesis 7, the moderating effect of neuroticism is proved, while Hypothesis 6 about moderating effect of extraversion is not supported. Figure 2 and Figure 3 show the effect of interactions graphically. Consumers of high extraversion inclination are readily loyal to the store brand than consumers with low extraversion aptitude The relationship between customer satisfaction and loyalty are weaker for consumers with high neuroticism inclination, and vice versa. The personality trait of neuroticism displays a significant moderating effect on the customer satisfaction-loyalty link. The interaction 


 effect of extraversion, and the main effect of neuroticism on loyalty, however, are not significant in this study   Figure 2 Interactions of customer satisfaction and neuroticism   Figure 3 Interactions of customer satisfaction and extraversion  5. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSIONS  Previous research has largely neglected the issue of moderating effects of implicit factors, e.g. personality traits, on the relationship between customer satisfaction and loyalty. Against this background, the moderating impacts of extraversion and neuroticism traits on the satisfaction-loyalty link are investigated in this study The results reveal that extraversion aptitude has significant positive effect on customer loyalty, whereas neuroticism inclination is detrimental to the association between customer satisfaction and loyalty. The results also shed light on the importance of customer satisfaction and service quality as the literature has already suggested. Re-formulating and executing a refined strategy that improve service quality and enhance customer satisfaction will be the top priority for management in the retail context  The outcome of this research work makes a significant contribution to fill the gap in the literature of customer satisfaction and loyalty. It does so by providing a deep insight at the role of personality traits in the formation of loyalty. The classical CRM strategy to improve loyalty through increasing satisfaction is not always applicable to every customer un-distinguishably; rather it depends on the personality characteristics of consumer. Service marketing practitioners can also benefit from this research in discovering the origin and evolution of customer loyalty to formulate and execute appropriate marketing strategies. This study not only confirms the past findings in the extant body of literature that service quality and customer satisfaction play a crucial role in loyalty, but also discloses the implication of their dependence on consumersê personality characteristic. It is important for companies to discriminate customer groups who rely on satisfaction as the mediating driver to underpin loyalty from groups who are less sensitive to the satisfaction-loyalty conjugation 5 This research outcome indicates that an across-the-board CRM strategies to increase customer satisfaction not necessarily yields higher level of loyalty that is generally believed to be the antecedent of company profitability Consumers with neuroticism trait subject to the tendency of store switching, building a long term intimate relations with them could be a target too far to reach  This research comes with some limitations and subsequent opportunities for further study. First, the main effect of neuroticism and the moderating effect of extraversion didnêt manifest themselves in this study The purchase decision in a grocery supermarket context involves complicated factors besides product and service quality. Other considerations such as pricing, promotion discounting, food safety, country of origin, the use of private brand, and etc. inevitably interfere with the decision making process of customers in terms of repeat purchase. Applying the model to other contexts like specific product category or pure service industry can be the alternative to see the role of personality traits in the customer satisfaction-loyalty link. Second, we have focused on the relationship between customer satisfaction and loyalty. It would be desirable to analyze the role of personality traits in the formation process of customer satisfaction, and loyalty-profitability associations, in that way, we can from a broader perspective to gain a deeper insight into the impact of personality characteristics on consumption behavior Finally, reliability and validity of some constructs are not so satisfactory owing to the exploratory nature of this study. Further investigations are needed in the future to explore the functions of personality in consumer choice and behavior

6 Conclusions This work proposed a novel genetic feature selection framework for CBIRs It employs a wrapper strategy that searches for the best reduced feature set while optimizing 050or preserving\051 the quality of the solution From a ranking evaluation function three new 002tness functions namely F cA  F cB and F c have been proposed and evaluated in three experiments The proposed genetic feature selection approach which encompasses F cA  F cB and F c  has been compared with 050a\051 traditional methods found in the literature 050b\051 the StARMiner feature selector and 050c\051 the whole feature vector and signi\002cantly outperformed them The proposed approach has been able to optimize the accuracy of similarity queries while selecting a signi\002catively reduced number of features Additionally the proposal of combining the quality of the query results with the criterion of minimizing the number of selected features F cA and F cB  led to high accurate query answers while reducing the number of features more than the 002tness function F c  Therefore the 002nal processing cost of the queries is also reduced References  P  M d Aze v edo-Marques N A Rosa A J

     Figure 9. Argumentation Tree For Open GL  A1 The current system in flash does not have the functionality of dynamic allocation of particles like mine or clutter. It places them randomly  A1.1 That is not of much importance because it still gives a new position to mine and clutter particles A2 Current system in flash has faster response time as compared to system in Adobe Director A3 The current system doesnêt satisfy many of the features required for the new system like database A4 Adobe Flash cannot communicate with database A4.1 Flash doesnêt support database but database support is very important and critical A4.1.1 The system should be able to generate evaluation reports for trainee based on pr evious records stored in the database A5 Flash doesnêt create sound clips  A5.1 We donêt need sound creating features as the sys tem has to generate sound. We can play externally recorded sound files using Adobe Flash A6 Flash can provide good visual effects as compared to Adobe Director A7 The developer has good knowledge in development using Flash so the system can be developed quickly B1 We could reuse the system already developed for sound generation, as it is developed using Adobe Audition for analysis which is somehow related to Adobe Director B1.1 The current system is better synthesized in terms of sound production and the sound produced is also instantaneous rather than discrete B1.2 That current system has certain performance issues like slow response time B1.3 The current system in Adobe Director has the feature of producing dynamic coloring scheme on approaching a mine. This kind of scheme is highly preferable and is not present in Adobe Flash system B2 Adobe Director can provide more functionality as compared to the current flash system. E.g. Multiple sounds while detecting mines   B2.1 Adobe Director can provide better visual effects as compared to flash e.g. in case of GUIês   B2.2 A modified version of the current system in flash can also provide the same functionality B2.2.1 We cannot integrate code developed in other platforms with Flash, but Flash can be integrated in Adobe Director B3 The interface provided by flash is not professional enough. It is too simple and straight forward for doing more things in future   B4 Easily available plug-ins can help integrate the tracking system developed in C# with Adobe Director  B4.1 Code developed in Open GL/AL can also be integrated using Adobe Director using suitable stubs   B5 A new sound recognition algorithm is being developed in Adobe Audition which can be integrated with Adobe Director but not with Open GL or Flash Evidence supported B6 If the current system is reused; the project deadline can be met easily B7 The developer has very little experience in development using Adobe Director   B7.1 The developer can take help from the already developed system in Adobe Director C1 The tracking software already developed is coded in C#/NX5. We could reuse that and develop our system in Open GL/AL C1.1 Open GL has C# libraries which can be used to develop the system C2 Because the platform used is for high end application development, it can provide good GUI and database support C2.1 Open GL/AL can help us generate dynamic surfaces for mine detection and training which the original system in flash does not have C4 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C3 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C4 The time taken for developing the project using open GL will be comparatively more as the whole system would have to be developed from scratch C4.1 If Open GL has support for C# libraries, and then the system could be develope d faster as developer is quite familiar with programming languages like C 151 


   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
