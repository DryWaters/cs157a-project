Design and Analysis for RFID Authentication Protocol   Zhen Zhang 1 Shijie Zhou 1   1 SCSE, the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China zhangzhenjua@163.com,sjzhou@uestc.edu.cn Zongwei Luo 2 2 ETI, the University of Hong Kong zwluo@eti.hku.hk   Abstract  Radio frequency identification \(RFID\ technology has been widely used in ubiquitous infrastructures. On the other hand, the low-cost RFID system has potential risks such as privacy and security problems, which would be a big barrier for the application. First of all we analyze the current security protocols for the RFID system. To protect user privacy and remove security vulnerabilities we propose a robust and privacy preserving mutual authentication protocol that is suitable for the low-cost RFID environment. Finally the correctness of the proposed authentication protocol is proved by the BAN logic  1. Introduction  As an important technology, the secure problems of the RFID system attract a lot of attention. The low cost demanded for RFID tags forces them to be very resource limited. Thus the current Cryptographic algorithm can’t be directly used on them. A robust authentication protocol plays a key role in the RFID system. Unfortunately, most of the existing proposed protocols have some problems. Therefore, we put forward a robust RFID protocol and give a comprehensive analysis of it  The paper is organized as following: in section 2 the related protocols are introduced. Our approach is proposed in section 3. In section 4, we analyze our protocol in several aspects. Finally, we make the conclusion in section 5   2. Related Work  In the HB  th e T I D is in creas ed i n  each successful authentication session which can resist replay attack. The protocol also resolves the location problem by making a tag’s ID randomized in each interrogation. Unfortunately, this protocol can not resist man-in-the-middle attack.

 t h i s prot ocol i s  pron e t o be u n d er t w o k i n d s of  active attacks: De-synchronization Attack and Full Disclosure Attack  3. Robust Protocol Design  3.1. Main Idea  Our protocol is based on the challenge - response mechanism. The contents of tags can be searched out by the server through index-pseudonym \(IDS\. The mutual authentication between tags and the server is fulfilled by sharing a secret key. In each round, the back-end server and the tag update the secret key which ensures that the tag’s response is random. In our protocol, all important messages are encrypted with the hash algorithm  3.2. System Assumptions and Initialization  We assume that each tag shares a random secret key with the back-end server in the initiation. The secret keys are stored in the back-end database and can be indexed by the IDS. Tags only need to have a one-way hash function and the XOR ability. The reader and the server share a secret key K and can carry out the keyed hash operation with the K The records including the IDS, the key and the application-related information are managed by the back-end server Besides, the reader is not regarded as the trusted third party \(TTP\ So it must be authenticated by the server    3.3. Detailed Description       DB      Reader     Tag   Figure 1 Our protocol   The process of our proposed protocol is shown as figure 1 1\hallenge: Firstly the reader generates a random number r and calculates S = H K  r     2\espond: While receiving the challenge, the tag responds IDS, m=H\(key S C\ to the reader. The Chip unique serial number, C, is embedded in each tag  3\The reader forwards the certification information to the back-end server, including r, S, IDS and m  4\hile receiving the authentication information from the reader, the back-end server firstly certifies the reader through judging whether the received S is equal to H K  r so, the server considers the reader is valid and retrieves the corresponding information of the tag such as the secret key, IDS, C and so on, through the received IDS. Then the server calculates H key S C d compares it to the received m. If they are equal a random number R is generated by the back-end server, which is used for XORing with the old key to generate the new secret key key   key R and the new index IDS  H key  Here we have two problems must be solved, the uniqueness of the IDS and the anti-synchronization between the back-end server and the tags. A reasonable mechanism is designed to solve the first problem. We make the server testing the uniqueness of the H key  If the new index is not unique, the server renews R until H key es unique. For the second problem an anti-synchronous resistant mechanism is needed since the attacker may probably disturb the synchronization of the update between the server and the tag. If the attacker is successful, the valid tag can never be legally certified. We use the existing anti-synchronous resistant mechanism such as the mechanism described in t o  s o l v e t h i s  probl e m        5\While receiving the information from the reader the tag retrieves the stored key and calculates H key R the output is equal to the received H key R e tag considers that the reader is valid and carries out the update accordingly

4. Analysis of Our Protocol  4.1. Logic Analysis  In this section, we will validate the correctness of the proposed protocol based on the BAN logi BAN logic is the most important tool to formalize the authentication protocols. The basis for the logic is the belief of a party in the truth of a formula. Although there are other validation logics, we have chosen BAN because its formal process is simple and robust Since the main entities of this authentication process are the back-end server and the tag, we idealize the entities in the protocol as B and T 1\eneric type of protocol Message 1: B T S Message 2: T B: H key H\(key S C Message 3: B T R, H key R  2\ized protocol Message2: T B H H C Message 3: B T H R 3\itial assumptions Firstly, we can see the tag and the back-end server both believe their shared secret key and it’s rational because this is the basic purpose of the protocol’s design. Because the tag updates the secret key in each round, the key can be regarded as fresh  The assumption for the effectiveness of the key  A1  B   A2    The assumption for the fresh of the random number   A3   R  A4  B   S\ \(A5   key 4\The goal of the protocol  B   T      B   5\ication From the message 2, we can educe that  B H C From the assumption A1,we can see B    According to the Interpretation Rule    We can deduce B   T H  C Because B can search out the key and the chip serial number C of the tag, we can educe that  B C  B S, B    Applying the hash rule     We can deduce that   B   T  C  Applying the recognizability rule    We can deduce that  B   T    And from the assumption A4: B   S Applying freshness rule    We can deduce that: B    C  Applying and B   T   The first goal has been proved, now we will prove the second goal From the message 3, we can see: T H\(key, R  From the assumption A2: T    According to the interpretation Rule    We can deduce that: T   B H  Because the tag can see R: T R, T   Applying hash rule we can deduce that  T   B  R  From the assumption A5: T   key Applying the freshness rule     We can deduce that: T   R  According to and T   B   R Applying the recognizability rule   We can finally deduce that: T   B    So the second goal has been proved  4.2. Theoretical evaluation  We evaluate the protocol by judging whether the protocol satisfies the security requirement  1\nfidentiality and Integrity: The important information is hidden by the hash function In addition, we link C to the authentication information so as to ensure the data integrity 2\ility: We use the IDS as an index to help the server to search out a tag’s information, so the searching is efficient

3\vailability Man-in-the-middle Attack Prevention Our protocol is based on a mutual authentication, in which two random numbers R and r, refresh in each round of the protocol, are used. Moreover, we make the server validate the reader through the S=H K r\hus the adversary who wants to impersonate the valid reader can be detected Forgery Resistance The chip serial number C is embedded into the tag and refers to the authentication information. Thereby the simple forgery of tag can’t make any sense. In addition, the secrete information stored in each tag is pertinent to itself Replay Attack Prevention: Since the reader challenges the tag with the random information, the replay attack in step 2 can be prevented. Since the key and the m refresh in each round, the replay attack in step 3 and step 5 can be detected De-synchronization Resistance: we use the existing anti-synchronous resistant mechanism such as the mechanism in [5  m eet th i s  req u ire m en t 4\ocation Privacy: If the responses from the tag are constant, the location of the tag can be tracked. In our protocol, the response of the tag will be random in each protocol run. Hence the location privacy is guaranteed 5\orward Security Since the key updating is fulfilled whenever the authentication is successful, a future security compromise on an RFID tag will not reveal the data previously transmitted   5. Conclusion  As we discuss, the proposed protocol is correct and suits for the low-cost environment. It can also ensure the privacy of the tag, meet most of the security requirements and re sist the typical attacks Several mechanisms are used to make the protocol more robust, such as the dynamic refresh mechanism, the anti-collision mechanism and challenge-response mechanism The further work is to design a more robust anti-synchronous resistant mechanism to enhance our protocol  References  1 T  L i G   W a ng Se c u rity  A n a l y s is o f Tw o  Ultra-Lightweight RFID Authentication Protocols.

have analyzed and characterized the stochastic distribution of frame sizes of various NASA Shuttle and International Space Station video scenarios which have been taken from the public domain archives The rest of the section is organized as follows Below we present some of the features of MPEG 4 encoding techniques and we provide some statistical information of the frame sizes for video transmissions of generic video streams Subsequently in this section we analyze and characterize the statistical distribution of the MPEG 4 frame types for various NASA mission scenarios Results on MPEG Encoded Video Traffic In this section we provide some existing literature results on MPEG encoded video traffic We will expand the use of some of these results in the next section when we analyze the traffic pattern of mission specific videos MPEG Overview Due to the high bandwidth needs of uncompressed video streams several coding methods for compressing these streams have been developed One of the most widely used such methods has been MPEG coding There are three main schemes of MPEG encoding particularly MPEG-I MPEG-II and MPEG-IV3 MPEG-I schemes are a subset of the MPEG-II schemes The main difference between the two methods is that MPEG-II also provides support of interlaced video the format used by analog broadcast TV systems Another characteristic of MPEG-II video is that it is not optimized for low bit-rates less than 1 Mbit/s but outperforms MPEG-I at 3 Mbit/s and above All standards-conforming MPEG-II video decoders are fully capable of playing back MPEG-I video streams MPEG-IV is an expansion to MPEG-I to support video/audio objects 3D content low bitrate encoding and support for Digital Rights Management MPEG-IV also includes some higher efficiency video standards which may be an alternative to MPEG-II video MPEG Video Coding An HDTV camera generates a raw video stream of more than one billion bits per second This stream must be compressed if digital TV is to fit in the bandwidth of available on broadcast channels or be stored on digital media Fortunately video compression is practical since the data in pictures is often redundant in space and time For example the sky can be blue across the top of a picture and that blue sky can persist for frame after frame Also because of the way the eye works it is possible to delete some data from video pictures with almost no noticeable degradation in image quality TV cameras used in broadcasting usually generate 50 pictures a second in Europe or 59.94 pictures a second in North America Digital television requires that these 6 was abandoned Originally this standard was designed for HDTV but later was discovered that MPEG-II with extensions was sufficient for Note that MPEG-III standard HDTV pictures to be digitized so that they can be processed by computer hardware A common trick to reduce the amount of data that must be processed per second is to separate the picture into two fields the top field which is the odd numbered rows and the bottom field which is the even numbered rows The two fields are displayed alternately This is called interlaced video Two successive fields are called a frame The typical frame rate is then 25 or 29.97 frames a second If the video is not interlaced then it is called progressive video and each picture is a frame MPEG-2 supports both options MPEG-2 specifies that the raw frames be compressed into three kinds of frames I\(ntra-coded P\(redictivecoded and B\(idirectionally predictive-coded frames An I-frame is a compressed version of a single uncompressed raw frame It takes advantage of spatial redundancy and of the inability of the eye to detect certain changes in the image Unlike P-frames and B-frames Iframes do not depend on data in the preceding or the following frames P-frames provide more compression than I-frames because they take advantage of the data in the previous I-frame or Pframe P-frames use similar coding algorithms to I-frames but with the addition of the motion compensation with respect to the previous Ior P-frame I-frames and P-frames are called reference frames The processing of B-frames is similar to that of P-frames except that B-frames use the picture in the following reference frame as well as the picture in the preceding reference frame As a result B-frames usually provide more compression than P-frames B-frames are never reference frames After coding the frames are arranged in a deterministic periodic sequence called a GOP Group of Pictures Each GOP starts with an I-Frame and has a typical length of 15 frames e.g IBBPBBPBBPBBPBB however the standard is flexible about this MPEG video frame distribution In an attempt to characterize the traffic of real time MPEG video encoded streams various video scenarios such as movies TV shows sporting events have been analyzed in the literature 8 For these type of scenarios it has been determined that the frame size distributions for all I P and B frames can be approximated well by gamma distributions Unfortunately the shape of these distributions is highly susceptible to the content of the video being encoded In the literature the following observations have been made on the distribution of the frame sizes based on the video content  For typical TV sequences like sports news and music clips result in high peak bit rates and high 6 


peak-to-mean ratio when compared to movie sequences The reason for this is that rapid movement of a lot of small objects increase the amount of data necessary to encode a sequence The background in the video scenes plays a significant role in shaping the size of the video frames For this reason videos of similar content type e.g movies cartoons sporting events will have highly different statistical distributions of the frame sizes The size of the I-frames P-frames and B-frames highly depend on the amount of movement which exists in the video sequence e.g panning zooming background movement etc While I-frames encode each frame independently their sizes tend to be larger but they are less susceptible to movement than Pand B-frames Pand Bframes since they use the information from other frames in order to encode data tend to be more susceptible to movement Particularly for video sequences where there are a lot of small moving objects Pand B-frames may be of the same size as I-frames MPEG video encoding for NASA specific mission streams In this section we provide an analysis of some NASA mission specific video streams which have been obtained from the public domain archives Using this analysis we provide a tool which synthesizes video traffic that can be imported into a network simulator such as the SCaN simulator Video analysis In developing a good video traffic synthesization tool we need to determine what is the dynamic pattern of video traffic which we are interested in modeling From the literature on dynamic of video traffic 8 we have identified that frame size distributions can generally be modeled well by a gamma distribution For this analysis we have gathered a large set of different NASA specific videos We are presenting 7 particular videos which we have analyzed The set of videos are as follows Table 1 Video clips analyzed Video Video Content number 1 Space Walk I dark background 2 Space Walk II dark background 3 Astronaut working in the dark 4 Astronaut moving inside ISS and looking out the window 5 Astronaut working in a lab I 6 Astronaut working in a lab II 7 Astronaut giving a teleconference The above videos have been encoded into MPEG version 4 format The encoding has the following characteristics  The coding has been done in the CIF format at 352x288 resolution  The quantizer q value we have chosen is 1 80  The video is encoded at 25 frames a second  The encoding is performed with a fixed GOP IBBPBBPBBPBB The videos have been encoded using the ffmpeg video ripping tool   We have used the MP4Box to put mpeg4 codec frames into mp4 multiplexed stream We have input the multiplexed streams into mp4trace program in order to transmit the stream to the network and collect the traffic trace The output of the traffic trace was received in the following form 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 H B B p B B p B B p B B H 13898 2145 2299 3866 2027 2301 4001 1988 2079 3956 2178 1943 13842 14 3 3 4 2 3 4 2 3 4 3 2 14 0 522 0 522 0 522 0 642 0 642 0 642 0.761 0.761 0.761 0.881 0.881 0.881 1.001 The first column of the data set represents the frame number The second column represents the frame type where H  I Frame P  P frame and B  B frame The third column represents the size of the frame in bytes The fourth column represents the q value of the compression The fifth column represents the time stem For analyzing the statistical distributions of the frame sizes using these data sets we have developed three different Matlab scripts called Quick Frame Distribution Analyzer Gaussian Filtration Frame Analyzer and Frame Distribution Fitting Tool We will present the features of each one of the tools separately Quick Frame Distribution Analyzer The quick distribution analyzer uses the trace of the data sets in order to provide a quick sketch of the distribution for each one of the frame types The program works as follows First it separates all the data based on the type of frames For each one of the frame types it then determines the range of the frame sizes i.e what is the smallest and largest frame size of that type After this step the program divides the frame range in a set of equal subintervals and it determines the number of 7 


frames that fall in each one of the subintervals Finally the program uses the number of frames in each subinterval to plot an approximation of the pdf We note that the number of intervals in range of frame types will correspond to the number of points of the pdf approximation This means that if the number of intervals is small then the plot of the approximate pdf will have a small number of points generating some difficulty in trying to determine an approximate pdf for that frame type On the other hand if the number of frames is too large then there is a very good chance that most of the intervals will have a very small number of frames that fall inside of them resulting in a very choppy plot for the pdf approximation Determining a good number of intervals for each type of frames depends in the number of the frames of that type being analyzed Another problem with such an approach is that by changing the number of intervals for the frame type being analyzed in the case in which the number of frames of that type is small the pdf plot generated can change significantly This is due to the fact that a large number of frames may fall on one side of the boundary of such an interval In the case in which one changes the number of intervals these frames will now fall inside a different interval There are some benefits however for using this Quick Frame Distribution Analyzer First of all it provides a very quick plot which is a rough approximation of the frame size distribution Although the approximations generated by the Gaussian Filtration Frame Analyzer are better the Quick Frame Distribution Analyzer generates plots order of magnitude faster Also the Quick Frame Distribution Analyzer provides statistics to the user for each type of frames such as mean and variance of frame sizes minimum and maximum frame size Gaussian Filtration Frame Analyzer In the previous subsection we presented a program which generates a quick and rough approximation of the frame size distribution given the input data from the video traces The problem with that analyzer was that the distribution generated by the program is highly dependent on the quantization level of the ranges of the frame sizes and is generally not a smooth function due to the limited number of frames in the data sets scenario each one of the frames analyzed should be assumed not to have a size which is deterministic but rather comes from a distribution which is centered on that frame size One such distribution generally used for this type of filtration is a Gaussian normal distribution The benefits of using such a filtration are as follows  The distribution generation will not need to use a quantization technique so the program will not suffer from the quantization issue  The frame size distribution generated using such a filtration method will smooth out some of the noise due to the limited number of data points  We have seen that gamma distributions tend to be a good approximation for frame size distribution of each type Since gamma distribution is a smooth function by filtering some of the statistical noise using a filtration it will enable us to better determine the parameters for the gamma distribution which best approximate video for specific mission scenarios Frame Distribution Fitting Tool This tool is used in conjunction with the Gaussian Filtration Frame Analyzer in order to approximate by a gamma distribution the pdf of the frame sizes for all three types of frames Using this tool the user is able to adjust the two parameters describing the gamma distributions particularly the mean and the K-value which directly influences the variance of the distribution In particular a larger scale will make the distribution taller and narrower For all the data sets the mean of the gamma approximation was taken to be equal to the mean of the true data The K-value was adjusted accordingly in order to best fit the approximation to the true data Analyzed data In this section we present statistical data for the various scenarios proposed This data was gathered using the tools described in the previous sections In Table 2 we provide for each scenario analyzed the mean and the variance of the frame sizes of the I P and B frames We also provide the K-value for the gamma distribution which is centered and the data mean and best approximates the statistical data We plot the approximate gamma distributions for the various types of frames for each one of this scenarios in Figure 3 In this section we present a program which does not suffer from the quantization issue of the Quick Frame Distribution Analyzer Also this program filters out some of the statistical noise which is due to the limited data sets We motivate the intuition for this filtration as follows While making a video of a certain mission scenario a small change in the footage i.e the introduction of a small object in the picture may cause a small change in the encoded frame sizes For this reason while trying to derive a generic distribution to characterize a particular type of video 8

Figure 5 Statistically multiplexed traffic We note that in this case we would be able to utilize some of the free channel space for other types of transmissions which may be more delay tolerant see Figure 6 For example in this figure the bottom blue transmission can be thought to be a file which is packetized and needs to be transmitted down from the spacecraft We consider this file to be delay tolerant i.e the data is not needed right away down on the ground and it has a lower priority then the other traffics needed to be transmitted The delay tolerant packets will be transmitted only when the channel is not being fully utilized as to fill in the gaps available in the channel bandwidth This technique will delay the arrival of the delay tolerant traffic but will enable us to more fully utilize our channel bandwidth m T]T m Figure 6 Telemetry traffic along with delay tolerant traffic being sent via a channel We note in above scenario that although the delay tolerant traffic was transmitted at time 0 none of it was able to be transmitted until time 1 Also we note that the final delay tolerant traffic packet was transmitted 9 time instances later then it was received For this reason a buffering scheme must be devised such that all the delay tolerant traffic may be buffered until enough bandwidth for transmission exists Since no specific data was available on the dynamics of the various telemetry type traffics we developed a generic telemetry model which is formed by two types of traffic one constant bit rate which represents the sensory information which is constantly being transmitted down to the ground and an intermittent transmission similar to the on/off type of traffic used to model the voice activity in the audio/voice transmission section which represents file download and periodic data updates We assume that there will be a maximum bandwidth which may be allocated to telemetry constant bit rate  peak of intermittent transmission We will also assume that the intermittent transmission file transfer will transmit at the maximal possible rate when new files are ready to be transferred Using the above model we created a Matlab based tool for synthesizing traffic for simulation purposes The traffic generated by this tool is output to a file in a format which can be used by network simulation tools such as the SCaN simulator 5 COMMAND TRAFFIC MODEL The model for the command will be similar in spirit to the model which we have proposed for telemetry We see the data transmitted for command to be formed by two different types of transmission One constant bit rate which represents calls to various preloaded spacecraft subroutines and an intermittent transmission similar to the on/off type of traffic used to model the voice activity in the audio/voice transmission section which represents subroutine uploads to the spacecraft We assume that there will be a maximum bandwidth which may be allocated to command and we also assume that the intermittent transmission subroutine upload will transmit at the maximal possible rate when new subroutines are ready to be transferred Using this model we have developed a Matlab based traffic synthesizing tool The traffic provided by this tool can be used by network simulation tools such as the SCaN simulator 6 CONCLUSIONS This work has resulted in the development of a suite of traffic models that captures the fundamental types that will be in the space communications environment and in particular These models provide the capability to investigate the new IP-based communications functions and resulting performance that are required by the human exploration missions of NASA's Constellation Program and the Space Communications and Navigation SCaN network's ability to support them Four prototypical traffic models have been developed from which any number of streams may be generated 1 audio/voice 2 real-time motion imager live video 3 telemetry including both regular periodic data as well as intermittent file downloads and 4 command including periodic data as well as intermittent subroutine uploads The voice traffic model stochastically parameterizes calls talk times and talk spurts Multiple audio analysis tools were developed to assist in the derivation of parameters from data samples taken from relevant space missions Using these tools parameters of probability distributions were fit to data taken from Shuttle/ISS archives 12     n 


The characterization of motion imagery video traffic involved the stochastic characterization of I P B-frames of MPEG-4 sequences Several Matlab tools were developed to support video analyses wherein ISS and Shuttle specific mission video sequences were used to derive parameters for the associated model A general stochastic model was derived for data telemetry enabling broad parametric applicability ranging among constant bit stream periodic or bursty patterns This same general model through proper selection of parameters may also be used to model command data flow traffic Matlab programs were developed to enable each of the traffic types above to be synthesized and saved into a file for use by SCaN simulation for performance analyses Example flows were generated for a LEO case and an Ascent case and results illustrated using the SCaN Simulator These analyses show the need for such traffic models to determine packet loss including speech intelligibility and latency arising from both statistical multiplexing and potential use of DiffServ prioritization techniques when peak offered loads may undergo transient overload conditions 7 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The research described in this paper was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration REFERENCES 1 Esther Jennings and David Heckman Architecture Modeling and Performance Characterization of Space Communications and Navigation SCaN Network using MACHETE submitted to 2008 IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings March 1-8 2008 2 Michael Hammer and James Champy Reengineering the Corporation New York Harper Business 1993 3 G Edward Bryan Not All Programmers Are Created Equal 1994 IEEE Aerospace Applications Conference Proceedings February 5-12 1994 4 Voice Activity Detection Using Generalized Gamma Distribution in Advances in Artificial Intelligence part of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science Volume 3955 2006 5 Athina Markopoulou Fouad Tobagi and Mansour Karam Assessment of VoIP quality over Internet backbones In Proceedings of INFOCOM 2002 6 John Daigle and Joseph Langford Models for Analysis of Packet Voice Communications Systems IEEE JSAC SAC-4 6 1986 7 Harold Stem and Kim-Kwok Wong Modeling the on-off patterns in conversational speech including short silence gaps and the effects of interaction between speaking parties Vehicular Technology Conference 1994 8 0 Rose Statistical Properties of MPEG video traffic and their impact on traffic modeling in ATM systems Institute of Computer Science Report 101 University of Wurzburg 1995 BIOGRAPHY Tudor Stoenescu received a BS in Electrical Engineering  and an MS in Mathematics from North Dakota State University in 1999 and a MSE and PhD in  Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from University of Michigan in 2001 and 2004 respectively After receiving his PhD Dr Stoenescu accepted a Postdoctoral Scholar position in Information Science and Technology at California Institute of Technology In 2006 Dr Stoenescu joined the Telecommunications Architecture Group at Jet Propulsion Laboratory Dr Stoenescu's current research interests lie 13

 15  The architecture permits random access to any EDAC word within the recorder. Simultaneous writing and reading is supported.  Memory is divisible into blocks with an unlimited number of blocks forming a Sector.   Each sector contains information that permits reconstruction of the File Structure independent of the CDH Sector Definition As unique Data Units are identified by the CDH host, the SSR commences placement of information in the first available memory location The information placed therein contains information identifying the Sector and relevant information with respect to data unit identification  Figure 22 - Sector & Data Unit Structure Each sector of information has contained within identification as to the next sector tag as well as the tag of the previous sector.  In this way, should the file structure need to be rebuilt, a scan of memory anywhere will reveal not only the type and source of information encountered but also the logical placement of a ll relevant information before and after this data block Consumables For Flash memory technology, the data is stored, and erased, by the imposition of high voltages onto the substrate and controlling gates.  Therefore, this technology is stressful to the device and is rated to 100,000 write or erase cycles NROM technology uses a different charge storage mechanism and is therefore not subject to write/erase degradation Stability Testing has shown commercial NROM devices to retain data up to 300 krads, a simple refreshment following exposure permits a likewise gain in radiation tolerance That is 300krads, refresh, 600 krads, etc [1   Flash devices are prone to damaging charge-trapping and therefore do not benefit by the refreshment scheme outlined above.  The users of Flash must take the surrounding radiation environment into consideration when declaring the number of write cycles a certain design can accommodate Chassis Dimensions and mass for the HC-SSR assume the chassis is manufactured in 100 mils aluminum,  One possible design is shown in Figure 23  Figure 23 \226 Packaging Concept \226 HC-SSR Power Worst case power estimation for the Flash unit is 6W and 30W for an NROM-based design 9 The power estimation includes both SpaceWire interfaces enabled and simultaneous read and write of information occurring Unused non-volatile memory devices are unpowered and the non-addressed memory contro ller ASICs are in a Deep Sleep mode 8  C ONCLUSION  A review of data storage technologies was presented and evidence presented to affirm the assertion known as 223Moore\222s Law\224 that storage capacity of a single element will increase every \(a pprox.\0 months A prognostication of data recorder capacity requirements for future JPL mission and programs has been made.  Based upon a past history spanning over thirty years, it is clearly evident that required capacity will progress at an exponential rate, effectively mimicking the rate provided in Moore\222s Law.  A new Axiom is coined:  A reasonable accurate prediction of data recorder volume and power can be made when based upon today\222s technology and today\222s data storage requirements   9 Power margin \(uncer tainty\cluded in these figures Header/Sector ID Next Previous Data Unit Header Data Data Sector   Data Data Unit End Flag Next Previous

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
