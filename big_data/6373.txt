 1  I NTRODUCTION   The traditional Teaching Quality Evaluation System uses the Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation \(FCE\method to calculate the scores of the indicators. The FCE method can summary the teaching effectiveness comprehensively and give an evaluation value, that is a common method to assess the overall situation. After assessment, the flood of scoring data 
  Key words-Association rules; 0-1 Matrix; Teaching evaluation 
will be deleted, and the indicators were left as the next assessment indicators. In fact, the Score Data, which has or will be deleted, still have lots of valuable information that is not nutritious mining and use. The indicators, which were left are not reasonable and comprehensive at all. Using association rule techniques of data mining, the data, which to be deleted can be extracted and analyzed the indicators which are redundant and which can be replaced for. If the data which we ignored and discarded can be re-use, not only the design of indicators can become more reasonable, but also the assessment of teaching quality can be designed  more specific and more useful. This can be used as a guide of the teaching evaluation system to improve the teaching quality 
2  O VERVIEW OF A SSOCIATION R ULE M INING  Data Mining is a non-trivial process, which obtain valid novel, porentially useful and ultimately understandable patterns from a large number of data. Agrawal 1 first proposed the mining of association rules between entries in the database of customer transaction, and then many of the researchers do research on the Association Rule Mining 2.1  The process of association rule mining Association rule mining process mainly consists of two 
stages to find all the frequent itemsets associated rules 2.1.1  Find all the frequent itemsets High-frequency refers to the frequency of a item group relative to the frequency of all the records, must reach a certain level. The frequency of occurrence for a item group called the Support. Take 2-itemset, which contains two projects A and B, for example, we can obtained the project team support, by the formula \(1\ which contains {A, B}. If the support is greater than equal to the set minimum support threshold, {A, B} is called frequent itemsets. Meet the minimum support of a k-itemset, named as the Frequent kitemset, algorithm generate high-frequency k +1 from the 
Frequent k-itemset group, until can not found longer high frequent itemset A 
225 B\N A->B N\327100%            \(1 Confidence\(AB\\(A|B\=N A->B N A 327100%       \(2 2.1.2  Generate association rules To generate association rules from the frequent itemset, is the use of frequent k-itemset in the previous step to generate the rules. In the condition of the minimum reliability threshold, if a reliability obtained from a rule meet the minimum reliability, the rule is a association rule. For example, the rule of AB generated through the frequent kitemset{A, B}, its reliability can be obtained by the formula 
2\ if the reliability is greater than equal to the minimum reliability, AB is the association rule 2.2  Apriori Algorithm Apriori algorithm is one of the most influential mining Boolean association rules algorithm for frequent itemsets. The core is based on a two-stage recursive algorithm for Frequent Set thinking. Algorithm is as follows L1=find_frequent_1-itemsets\(D for\(k=2;Lk-1 k  Ck= apriori_gen\(Lk-1,min_sup for each transaction t 
201 D scan D for counts Ct= subset\(Ck,t\et the subsets of t that are candidates for each candidate c 201 Ct

201 Ck|c.count min_sup  return L 201 k Lk In the Apriori algorithm, candidates set is produced layer by layer, while to genarate the frequent set of second layer must scan the entire database, then gather frequent sets to generate the next level of candidate items, until the frequent item sets can not combine to produce the candidate set Therefore, the algorithm has two weak points: the existence of 


  a large number of redundant rules mining; performance slow which caused by too much computing implementation 3  I MPROVED A PRIORI A LGORITHM  3.1 Convert the transaction database to 0-1 matrix Definition: Let the transaction database D, have n transactions T i i = 1,2, ... n\, m items I j j = 1,2, ... m\. First order to generate a n × m matrix A \(D\matrix as follows 1   I j T i  a ij  0    I j T i  Matrix A \(D\e 0-1 matrix 2 corresponding to transaction database D Among them, the support count of single set I j in the transaction database D, is the number of 1 in column j of A D\ while the support count of general item set is the nuber of all 1 row in the corresponding sub-matrix 3.2 Improved Algorithm Calculate the sum of each row in the the 0-1 matrix A ,and the number of items included in all transactions Select the largest number of items k \(may contain more\ alternative sets for the frequent item sets Calculate every support of the alternative sets, if support is less than the minimum support \( minsup\move the set directly from the alternative sets; if the final selected alternative sets is empty, the k minus 1 to until find the frequent item sets Among them calculate the support of itemsets does not use the traditional links, pruning and other steps, but use of matrix calculations directly. Mainly through the new matrix which constituted by the itemsets, until scan the matrix and calculate the number of rows to all 1, that is the support. This methord do not repeat the database scaning, reducing the I / 0 load 4  I MPROVED A PRIORI ALGORITHM IN TEACHING EVALUATION  August 2004 the Ministry of Education promulgated the Undergraduate Teaching Assessment Program \(Trial Assessment Program\, provides for the evaluation of three hierarchical levels, including 7 Overall targets, 19 Secondary indicators and 44 Observation points, as shown in Table 3-1 Table 4-1 Overall targets, Secondary indicators and Observation points Overall targets Secondary indicators Observation points Quantity Percentage  Quantity Percentage  weight distribution Guiding ideology 2 10.5 3 6.8 1.0  0.5  0.5 Faculty 2 10.5 3 13.6 0.3  0.4  0.3 0.3  0.3  0.4 Conditions and the using 2 10.5 7 16.0 0.2  0.2  0.2 0.2  0.2  0.6 0.4 Construction and reform 3 15.8 10 22.7 0.5  0.5  0.3 0.3  0.3  0.1 0.4  0.3  0.2 0.1 Teaching management 2 10.5 5 11.4 0.6  0.4  0.3 0.3  0.4 Style 2 10.5 4 9.1 1.0  0.3  0.3 0.4 Teaching effectiveness 6 31.7 9 20.5 0.7  0.3  0.5 0.5  1.0  1.0 0.6  0.4  1.0 Total 19 100.0 44 100   The Overall targets,Secondary indicators and Observation points teaching evaluation index involved in the "assessment program" to be extracted, according to the own teachers requirements of most university, as indicators of the teaching evaluation system,and valued with the output of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method Teaching evaluation system of teachers evaluation index established by various colleges and universities, is not identical. But the evaluation method is similar, that is no assign scores to the level of assessment from the evaluation of teachers which is done by students, such as excellent, good, in and poor. After the calculation of the scores, the results of quality assessment of teachers can be got. This traditional Teaching Quality Evaluation System can summary the teaching effectiveness comprehensively and give an evaluation value, that is a common method to assess the overall situation. However, this assessment is calculated by a large number of index scores. Althouge the overall rating of teaching quality can be valued, the strengths and weaknesses of the teacher can not be informed clearly, and thus can not be made for teachers to improve teaching quality. After assessment, the flood of scoring data will be deleted, and the indicators were left as the next assessment indicators. In fact the Score Data, which has or will be deleted, still have lots of valuable information that is not nutritious mining and use. The indicators, which were left, are not reasonable and comprehensive at all Using of association rule mining technology, the student evaluation of teachers of high frequency indicators can be extracted.

And three association rules No Late: excellent, Correcting Homework: excellent   Teaching Attitudes: excellent} , { Supplementary Program Good  Note Students Practice: Good}, {Note Students Practice: Good  Supplementary Program: Good Evaluation of this indicator can screen out the highest frequency index evaluation value, that is more scientific and effective, enabling more targeted teacher evaluation. In the above example, there are at least six students in ten in the assessment selected following evaluation: excellent in Teaching Attitude bar, excellent in No Late bar, and excellent in Correcting Homework bar. At least six students in ten in the assessment of teachers also selected following evaluation good in Supplementary Program bar, good in Note Students Practice bar. So the teacher seriously done well in the three indicators,these were Teaching Attitudes, No Late, Correcting Homework. And should pay attention to two indicators , that are Supplementary Program and Note Students Practice. From the association rule Mining, we can found that all the sets that excellent in No Late bar and excellent in Correcting Homework bar, do score excellent in Teaching Attitudes bar This shows the Teaching Attitudes of the evaluation is repetitive and can be removed or changed to other evaluation index Through the analysis of instance evaluation results indicate that the use of association rules in data mining technology on teaching quality assessment in-depth analysis of the data is feasible, and can clearly inform the strengths and weaknesses in teaching, and make recommendations to improve the quality of teaching. Not only dig deep using value of data, but also improve the teaching quality of teachers, and provides an important reference for teaching quality assessment R EFERENCES  1  Agrawal R, Srikant R Fast Algorithm for Mining Association rules  Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on VLDB, Santiago Chile, 1994, pp: 487 ~ 499 2  Jaiwei Han, Michcline Kamber Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques  Beijing: China Machinery Industry Press, 2007, 146 183 3  Zhang Herui,Hao Bingxin Higher Algebra 3 rd ed, Beijing: Higher Education Press, 1993, 112~140 4  Pei Guying, "Algorithm for Association Rule Mining Based on Boolean Matrix Automation and Instrumentation No. 5, 2009 16~18

From the results it is inferred that automatic membership function generation provides consistent rule hiding even in the absence of expertise VI C ONCLUSION In this paper, we proposed a learning method to derive membership functions automatically for numeric data and presented a method for preventing extraction of useful association rules from quantitative data by decreasing the support of the RHS of the rule. Unlike previous approaches which mainly deals with association rules in binary database, our approach deals with hiding the association rules in quantitative database. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is more efficient as it facilitates better rule hiding and  minimizes the number of lost rules and ghost rules. Also, this approach makes minimum modification of data. To further minimize the side effect and modification to database genetic algorithm can be used REFERENCES 1 T Be rbe rog lu a n d M Ka y a  H iding F u z z y  A s soc ia tion R u le s in Quantitative Data  The 3rd InternationalConference on Grid and Pervasive Computing Workshops, May 2008, pp. 387392 2 M a noj G upta a nd R  C  J o s h i  P r i v a cy P r e s e r v i ng Fuz zy  Association Rules in in Quantitative Data, International Journal of Computer Theory and Engineering, Vol. 1, No. 4 October, 2009, 382-388 3 V a ssilios S V e ry k i os, A  K.

In order to notice the differences, all grayed cells are pruned thanks to the RSA education wage [6;7] [8;9] [10;13] [14;18 2.85; 4.70] 3 4 15 -22 4.75; 7.14] 1 3 8 -12 7.30; 12.67] -2 -3 1 5 13.00; 26.29] -1 -4 -25 30 TABLE VII ENHANCED CONTINGENCY TABLE OF VARIATIONS FOR THE ASSOCIATION \(EDUCATION-WAGE This table is the starting point of the consolidation process described below 39 


V. CONSOLIDATION PROCESS The first step to build the largest zones is to scan the enhanced contingency table of variations looking for the cell with the highest absolute value This cell constitutes the first rectangle noted R1 with the coordinates of upper left point pl and lower right point pr The second scan compares all the values in the immediate neighborhood of R1. The expansion is performed in descending fashion, i.e. starting from the largest value with similar behavior of the constituted rectangle expanded to the new coordinates The expansion of the formed rectangle continues by performing the summation of its vicinity cells values. We start by including cells whose values sum is the largest. The expansion stops once meeting null cells and the consolidation process ends when all maximal rectangles are formed. These results allow restricting the number of records to be processed by only keeping those retained after the consolidation phase When applying this process to the enhanced contingency table of variations resulting from the education-wage only would be considered the records included in the clusters "education=[10;13]" or "education=[14;18]" associated to "wage=[2.85;4.70]" or wage=[13;26.29 Notice, in the case of the association education ? wage process enables to focus on 172 records instead of 526 \(32 VI. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we describe our discretization approach focusing on the potential interactions between a databases variables. This approach makes it possible to carry out a contextual discretization maximizing the informativeness and highlighting the variables dependencies The use of a tabular representation is particularly interesting in the case of numeric variables
