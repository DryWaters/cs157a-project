ing individualized behavior models for the b users We investigate the use of maximum entropy and Markov mixture models for generating probabilistic behavior models We 336rst build a global behavior model for the entire population and then personalize this global model for the isting users by assigning each user individual component weights for the mixture model We then use these individual weights to group the users into behavior model clusters We show that the clusters generated in this manner are interpretable and able to represent dominant behavior patterns We conduct of\337ine experiments on around two months 
worth of data from CiteSeer n online digital library for computer science research papers currently storing more than 470,000 documents We show that both maximum entropy and Markov based personal user behavior models are strong predictive models We also show that maximum entropy based mixture model outperforms Markov mixture models in recognizing complex user behavior patterns 1 Introduction and Related Work Whether the underlying reason is to detect fraud or malicious visitors to improve the organization of a Web site to better serve customers or to identify hidden patterns and 
new trends in consumer behavior for improving pro\336t massive amounts of Web data are being collected and stored everyday Understanding user behavior and discovering the valuable information within such huge databases involves several phases data cleaning and preprocessing  where typically noise is removed log 336les are broken into sessions and users are identi\336ed data transformation  where useful features are selected to represent the data and/or dimension reduction techniques are used to reduce the size of the data  001 
Work done at NEC Laboratories America applying data mining techniques to identify interesting patterns statistical or predictive models or correlations among parts of data interpretation of the results  which includes visualization of the discovered knowledge and transforming them into user friendly formats The focus of this paper is the data mining and interpretation phases of this process We investigate the use of maximum entropy mixture models and mixture of Markov models for inferring individualized behavior models of Web 
users where a behavior model is a probabilistic model describing which actions the user will perform in the future Mixture models also provide a means to cluster the data The interpretation of clusters obtained in our experiments allows us to conclude that maximum entropy and Markov mixture models have both descriptive and predictive power A variety of data mining techniques have been used for the purpose of Web data analysis Association rule extraction collaborative 336ltering clustering classi\336cation dependency modeling and sequential pattern analysis are the most common and noticeable of these methods Association rule extraction has been used to identify sets of items 
that are accessed together Collaborati v e 336ltering algorithms 21 ha v e been used to 336rst 336nd similar users based on the overlap between their requested items and then recommend the n user items accessed by the likeminded users Clustering in the context of Web data can either be used to group together similar items or users with similar usage patterns Probabilistic graphical models are used to r and represent dependencies among different variables such as for instance the effect of gender on the shopping behavior Dependency and Bayesian networks are e xamples of such techniques Sequential pattern analysis algorithms use time-ordered sessions

probabilistic model P  A next  H  U   where A next is the next action taken by the user U  H  U  is the action history for the user U in the present session and P can be any probabilistic function In our previous work on sequence modeling and recommender systems 6 we e x plored mixture of maximum entropy maxent and Markov models in the context of sequential analysis problems Here we use mixture models to capture the diversity in individual behaviors Each component of a mixture model represents a dominant pattern in the data and each sequence user sessions in our case is modeled as a weighted combination of these components By grouping each session into the highest weighted component we are also able to cluster the user sessions Personalization is d by optimizing the weights for each individual user as suggested by Cadez et al W e are able to eliminate one of the biggest problems of personalization the lack of suf\336cient information about each individual by starting with a global model and optimizing the weights for each individual with respect to the amount of data we have about him/her We use web-server logs of CiteSeer a.k.a ResearchIndex 1  an online digital library

and preprocessing steps in Section 5 Experimental results and comparisons are n in Section 6 In Section 7 e present our conclusions and ponder future work 2 General Notation and Problem De\336nition We assume that we are given a data set consisting of ordered sequences in some alphabet and that each sequence is labeled with a user id U  For the purposes of this paper we refer to individual items in the alphabet as actions and each sequence represents a user session r each action in a user session the history H  U  is de\336ned as the so-far observed ordered sequence of actions Our behavior model for individual U is a model e.g maxent or Markov that predicts the next action A next n the history H  U   Therefore the problem is to infer this model P  A next  H  U  Data   for each individual given the training data A serious drawback of personalization algorithms for the Web domain is the insuf\336cient data problem r many transaction data sets most user ids are seen only in one or two sessions which makes it impossible to learn reliable predictive pro\336les for those users If the Web site does not require registration and the user ids are set with temporary cookies the situation gets even worse Log 336les will have lots of users with only a few sessions most of which won\325t be seen in the future transactions at all and most of the users seen in run-time will be new users unknown to the system This is the primary reason why a straightforward approach to personalization that consists of learning the model for each user only from that user\325s past transactions fails for the personalization task with the Web data Specifically n after being learned on a wealth of training data for a user the system could suffer from r-\336tting and 322cold-start\323 problem for new visitors the Web site The approach that we advocate is to use a global mixture model to capture speci\336c patterns of general behavior of the users and once the global model is learned we optimize the weight of each component for each known user individually hence combining the global patterns with individual irregularities Proceedings of the Third IEEE

3 Mixture of Maxent and Markov Models In this section we describe the global and individualized maxent and Markov mixture models 3.1 Global Mixture Models The use of mixture models to represent the behavior of an individual can be viewed as assuming that the ordered sequence of actions of a visitor U at the Web site is assigned to cluster k with a probability 001 k  k 1 N c  and each cluster assigns a probability to the sequence via a distribution speci\336c to that cluster The formal de\336nition of a N c component mixture model is as follows P  A next  H  U  Data  N c 001 k 1 001 k P  A next  H  U   Data k  where 002 N c k 1 001 k 1  001 k is the prior probability of cluster k and P  A next  H  U  Data,k  is the distribution for the k th component r the global model 001 k 325s take the same values across all the users Based on the results of our previous research 17 we decided to use 336rst order Mark o v model and maxent to model cluster-speci\336c distributions Both models are explained in the following sections 3.1.1 Markov Model In the 336rst order Markov model the current action depends on the history H  U  only through the last observed action A prev  The de\336nition of a Markov model for the distribution of the k th cluster is therefore P  A next  H  U   Data k  001 002 0 k  H  U   003 h 1 002 h 002  h 1 k where 002 0 k is the probability of observing H  U  0 as the 336rst action in the history and 002  h 001 h 1 k is the probability of observing a transition from action number h to action number h 1 in the history For h   H  U    action with index h 1 is A next  The number of parameters is quadratic in the number of actions Note that the regular Markov model only depends on the so-called bigrams or 336rst order Markov terms i.e the frequencies of pairs of consecutive actions 3.1.2 Maximum Entropy Model It\325s also possible to model the component distribution P  A next  H  U  Data,k  as a maximum entropy model Maximum entropy provides a framework to combine information from different knowledge sources Each knowledge source imposes a set of constraints on the combined model The intersection of all the constraints contains a set of probability functions satisfying all the conditions Maximum entropy principle chooses among these functions the one with the highest information entropy i.e the most 337at function We are motivated to use maximum entropy approach in order to combine 336rst order Markov model features with other properties of the data More speci\336cally e believe that the most recent action A prev  has the most in\337uence on the current action taken by the user ever e also believe that actions other than A prev seen in the history H  U  are also  Higher order Markov models may seem to be solving this problem t it is not feasible to build them for high-dimensional data due to the curse of dimensionality Furthermore higher order Markov models use a strict order of the action sequence Maxent on the other hand can be set up with much milder restrictions We selected two 337avors of low-order statistics or features as they are typically referred to in the maximum entropy literature for estimation Bigrams or 336rst order Markov terms were one type In order to introduce long term dependence of A next on the actions that occurred in the history of the user session we include triggers positionspeci\336c or non-position-speci\336c in addition to bigrams A non position-speci\336c trigger is de\336ned as a pair of actions  a b  in a iven cluster such that P  A next  b  a 001 H  U  is substantially different from P  A next  b   If we restrict the action pairs to be exactly  H  U   actions apart from each other the resulting trigger would be positionspeci\336c We use both types of triggers in our experiments To measure the quality of triggers and in order to rank them we computed mutual information between events E 1   A next  b  and E 2   a 001 H  U    We then discarded low scoring triggers but retained all bigrams Note that the quantity and quality of selected triggers depend on the length of H  U   Since the majority of the user sessions is shorter than 5 actions we chose 5 to be the maximum length of the history The set of features bigrams and triggers in our case together with maximum entropy as an objective function can be shown to lead to the following form of the conditional maximum entropy model P  A next  H  U  Data  1  Z 001  H  U  exp  002 S s 1 003 s F s  A next H  U  where Z  H  U  is a normalization constant ensuring that the distribution sums to 1 and F s are the features The set of parameters  003  needs to be found from the following set of equations that restrict the distribution P  A next  H  U  Data  to have the same expected value for each feature as seen in the training data 001 H 001 A P  A  H Data  F s  A H  002 H  U  F s  A  H  U  H  U  s 1 S where the left hand side represents the expectation up to a normalization factor of the feature F s  A

to the distribution P  A  H Data  and the right hand side is the expected value up to the same normalization factor of this feature in the training data There exist ef\336cient algorithms for 336nding the parameters  003  e.g generalized impro v e d 20 and sequential conditional iterati v e scaling algorithms that are kno wn to rge if the constraints imposed on P are consistent The pseudocode of the algorithm and a detailed discussion on the ways of speeding it up can be found for example in 13 9 Under fairly general assumptions maximum entropy model can also be shown to be a maximum likelihood model Emplo ying a Gaussian prior with a z ero mean on parameters 003 yields a maximum aposteriori solution that has been shown to be more accurate than the related maximum likelihood solution and other smoothing techniques for maximum entropy models W e use Gaussian smoothing in our experiments for a maxent model 3.2 Personalized Mixture Model We personalize the mixture model by using individual cluster probabilities 001 U,k 325s for each user The resulting model is therefore speci\336c to each user U  P U  A next  H  U  Data  N c 001 k 1 001 U,k P  A next  H  U  k  where 002 N c k 1 001 U,k 1  The component distribution P  A next  H  U  Data,k   is the same as in global mixture model either maximum entropy r Markov model which is 336xed across all users The N c component distributions can also be viewed as N c dimensions of the whole population\325s behavior space 001 U,k 325s specify where the user U stands in this population This formulation allows the use of the whole population\325s experience for each individual\325s own use thus avoiding the r-\336tting problem Unknown user problem is resolved naturally as well by using the global 001 k 325s for new users 3.3 Parameter Estimation We assume that the action sequences are drawn independently from a d distribution Thus the likelihood of the data can be formulated as the product of the individual likelihoods P  Data  001  N u 003 k 1 P  Data U  001 where 001 stands for the full set of parameters of the model and N u is the number of users By the chain rule P  Data U  001  N s 003 s 1 N s a 003 j 1 P  A j  H  U   001 where N s is the number of sesions user U has and N s a is the number of actions taken by user U in session s  Unknown parameters for the global model include 001 k 325s and 003 k 325s of the maxent or 002 k 325s of the Markov model Parameters can be learned by using the Expectation-Maximization EM algorithm as described in 3 r learning the personalized model two different approaches can be taken Our goal is to learn individual 001 U,k 325s therefore we can 336x the component distribution model\325s parameters i.e 003 k 325s of the maxent model or 002 k 325s of the Markov model to the values of the global model and perform the optimization on the 001 U,k 325s only r e can vary the component distribution\325s parameters as well r both cases the optimization is carried out for each user individually i.e personal models are trained on each user\325s data set separately If the 336rst approach is taken and the component distribution model parameters are 336xed EM algorithm is run on each individual\325s own data set to 336nd 001 U,k 325s which are initialized with the global 001 k values If the second approach is chosen instead EM algorithm is used to learn both 001 U,k 325s and component distribution model parameters which are again initialized with the values learned for the global model Steps of the parameter estimation process can be summarized as follows 200 Run EM on the whole data set to learn global 001 k 325s and component distribution model parameters 200 Group the sessions by individuals 200 Do either 320 Fix component distribution parameters to the global values and initialize 001 U,k 325s with global 001 k values 320 Run EM on the individual data sets to learn 001 U,k 325s Or 320 Initialize 001 U,k 325s and component distribution parameters with global values 320 Run EM on the individual data sets to learn all the parameters According to this framework for the new users in the test set user speci\336c 001 values will be the initialization values which are the global 001 k 325s since there will be no user data to change it Notice that even if the component distribution parameters are optimized for the personal model these values won\325t e user speci\336c values Cadez et al mention that the 336nal values of the parameters of the multinomial model are close to the initial estimates r we found that for maxent and Markov models this is not true Optimizing the 003 k 325s of the maxent model or 002 k 325s of the Markov model for the second time causes the model to over-\336t the known users\325 behavior We recomend using the initial global model Proceedings of the Third IEEE Internati onal Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM\22203 0-7695-1978-4/03 $ 17.00 \251 2003 IEEE 


for the unknown users if this approach is taken for parameter estimation Since the difference between the recommended method and 336xed component distribution parameter method is negligible and optimizing the 003 k 325s for maxent is too time consuming we chose 336xing these parameters to conduct our experiments 4 Visualization and Interpretation As mentioned earlier each component of a mixture model can be viewed as a cluster representing a certain pattern present in the data The resulting model represents each session as a weighted combination of these clusters n the observed session S U of user U  the probability distribution r the cluster variable k can be computed by the Bayesian rule P  k  S U Data  001 k P U  S U  Data k   002 N c k 001 1 001 k 001 P U  S U  Data k 003  where P U  S U  Data k   S U  003 j 1 P U  A j  H  U   Data k  Once P  k  S U Data  325s which are aldo referred to as membership probabilities are computed we assign session S U to the cluster with highest probability Instead of this hard assignment strategy we could also do sof t clustering and assign the session to a set of clusters Interpreting the key behaviors exhibited by the users in each cluster is important for a number of tasks such s managing the site targeted advertising identifying malicious visitors It also helps understanding the navigation patterns of different user groups and therefore helps in organizing the site to better suit the users Visualizing the users\325 behavior also makes it possible to identify and provide customized services like customized help and recommendations 5 Data Description and Preprocessing Our data set consists f CiteSeer log 336les covering a period of approximately two months The log 336les are a series of transaction in the

preprocessing the data is aggregating the transactions by user id and breaking them into sessions We use time oriented heuristics to recognize new sessions r a d user id we de\336ne a session as a sequence of actions with no two consecutive actions more than 300 seconds apart If a user is inactive for more than 300 seconds his/her next action is considered as the start of a ew session Next we identify robots and discard sessions belonging to them We examine the histogram of number of accesses in one session to recognize robots Users who access the archive more than some threshold in one session are labeled as robots After removing the robot sessions we collapse the same consecutive actions into a single instance of that action and discard sessions which contain only one action We chronologically partitioned the data into 1,720,512 training sessions and 430,128 test sessions The total number of actions in the training data is 12,200,965 and in test data this number is 3,853,108 The average number of sessions per user is 7 in the training data and 9 in the test data The preprocessed data is represented as a collection of ordered sequences of user actions where each sequence is labeled with a user id Test data includes 54,429 users out of which only 8139 of the users were seen in the training data also Since the model proposed in this paper uses the global model for the

won\325t e seen clearly in the results for all the users We therefore report the results on the revisiting users and give the results for the whole data if there are any major differences between the two cases 6 Experimental Results and Comparisons We evaluated the user behavior models based on the accuracy f their predictions and visualized the user behavior clusters to demonstrate the descriptive ability of the models Prediction accuracy is evaluated by scanning the user sessions and for each action in the session predicting the identity of the following action In our experiments we compare mixtures of position speci\336c PS maximum entropy models mixtures of non position speci\336c non-PS maximum entropy models and mixtures of Markov models r maximum entropy models the length of the history s set to 5 Our main criteria for prediction evaluation is the hit ratio  which is the ratio of the correct predictions to the total number of predictions made The predictions made by the mixture models are actually lists of ranked actions where the ranking is done by ordering the actions by their probability values If the system were to predict only one action the 336rst action on the ranked list would be chosen r the quality of the remaining predictions is also an indication of the success of the model Therefore we take the 336rst N predictions on the list and evaluate the performance of the models based on the success of these N predictions for N 1   5  10 In this case a hit occurs if the true action is predicted in any f these N guesses We also report the likelihoods of the models on the test data since it\325s our optimization criteria and is another indication of how well the model represents the data Table  Hit ratio results on known users for 3 component

and non-PS speci\336c maxent models\325 hit ratios are very close to each other but non-PS model performed better than the PS in the 10-component mixture model and for N 002 2 in 3-component mixture model An interesting point about the non-PS maxent model is the altitude of the ffect of personalization on it Although the PS model is better in all test cases for the global models personalization s the non-PS model more such that it\325s able to beat the PS model As follows from the tables personalized Markov mixture model has the highest hit ratio for the known users r non-PS maxent s able to perform better for N 002 2 in the 3-component model This result may seem surprising considering the fact that 336rst order Markov models are making use of only bigrams whereas maxent models are using triggers in addition to bigrams t it\325s not The goal of maximum entropy is to choose the most general model within the set of functions satisfying the constraints Markov models on the other hand do not have this property and thus may 336t the training data better The advantage of maxent models can be seen more clearly when looked at the results for all users Table 4 and Table 5 present the hit ratios of the personal models for 3-component and 10component mixture models respectively Non-PS maxent outperforms Markov model for all prediction list lengths t 4 in 3-component mixture model and it performs worse only for N 3  4  5 in the 10-component mixture model In Table 6 we report the likelihood of the personalized models for the test data Best likelihood is d by Markov mixture model and non-PS maxent mixture follows it PS maxent mixture performs even worse when the number of components is increased As discussed in Section 4 e are also interested in the interpretation of the user

dictive model for representing user behaviors and a useful mechanism for identifying and interpreting user behavior patterns for the Web data 7 Conclusions and Future Work We described a mixture model based approach to generating and visualizing individual behavior models for CiteSeer users We represented the Web data as a collection of ordered action sequences for each user We introduced a maximum entropy based approach for modeling the user behavior motivated by its ability to model long term dependencies in data sequences In addition to maxent model we also investigated the use of 336rst order Markov mixture models We demonstrated that both methods are able to generate strong predictive models with different strengths and weaknesses Markov model performed better for predicting the behavior of the known users whereas maximum entropy model was better at modeling the global behavior model and therefore the unknown users also We used a simple method to achieve personalization yet managed to avoid the insuf\336cient data problem of traditional personalization techniques By using mixture model based clustering we were able to identify and visualize speci\336c behavior patterns of CiteSeer users where it s demonstrated that maximum entropy model\325s computational cost pays off t recognizing complex dominant patterns of user behavior We plan to expand our work on identifying speci\336c user behavior patterns and provide customized services for instance customized recommendations for each of the behavior model groups We are also interested in naming these groups of users We intend to perform real-time experiments on CiteSeer with our maximum entropy based predictive model We are also planning to apply our personalization algorithm to mixtures of hidden Markov models and compare it with the maxent model proposed in this paper 8 Acknowledgements This work has been partially supported by a grant from Lockheed Martin We would like to thank Steve Lawrence for making

wording as follows more knowledgeable in operation and hazards associated with electric power generation transmission and/or distribution equipment Recommends that OSHA add a definition for the word practicable and replace the word feasible with practicable wherever it appears in the proposed regulations and that practicable be further defined as capable of being accomplished by reasonably available and economic means OTHER ISSUES Clothing OSHA requested comments on the advisability of adopting requirements regarding the clothing worn by electric utility industry employees EEI has presented comments which indicates research is underway prior to establishing a standard for clothing to be worn by electric utility employees However EEI's position is that this standard has not developed to the extent that it could be included in the OSHA Rules Both APPA and EEI state that they would support a requirement that employers train employees regarding the proper type of clothing to wear to minimize hazards when working in the vicinity of exposed energized facilities Grandfathering Due to the anticipated cost impact on the utility industry of the proposed Rules requiring that existing installations be brought to the requirements of the proposed Rules both APPA and EEI propose that the final Rules include an omnibus grandfather provision This provision would exempt those selected types of facilities from modification to meet the new rules EEI states that if the grandfathering concept is incorporated that electric utility employees will not be deprived of proper protection They propose that employers be required to provide employees with a level of protection equivalent to that which the standard would require in those instances in which the utility does not choose to modify existing facilities to comply with the final standard Rubber Sleeves OSHA requests comments from the industry on whether it would be advisable to require rubber insulating sleeves when gloves are used on lines or equipment energized at more than a given voltage EEI states its position that utilities should continue to have the option of choosing rubber gloves or gloves and sleeves to protect employees when it is necessary to work closer to energized lines than the distances specified in the clearance tables Preemuting State Laws EEI requests that the final Rules be clear in their preempting state rules applicable to the operation and maintenance work rules for electric power systems. This is especially critical since some states now have existing laws which are more stringent than the proposed OSHA Rules Examples are 1 in California and Pennsylvania where electric utility linemen are prohibited from using rubber gloves to work on lines and equipment energized at more than certain voltages and 2 in California and Connecticut where the live line bare hand method of working on high voltage transmission systems is prohibited One utility Pacific Gas  Electric has obtained a variance from the California OSHA to perform live line bare-hand transmission maintenance work on an experimental basis Coiiflicts Between the Rilles and Part 1926 Subpart V Since many of the work procedures in construction work and operation and maintenance work are similar and difficult to distinguish between EEI requests that the final order be clear in establishing which rule has jurisdiction over such similar work areas A2-19 v 


IMPACTS ON COSTS AND ASSOCIATED BENEFITS In its introduction to the proposed rules OSHA has provided an estimate of the annual cost impact on the electric utility industry for the proposed des of approximately 20.7 million OSHA estimates that compliance with this proposed standard would annually prevent between 24 and 28 fatalities and 2,175 injuries per year The utilities which have responded to this proposed standard through their respective associations have questioned the claims both of the magnitude of the cost involved and the benefit to the industry in preventing fatalities and lost-time injuries Both EEI and APPA feel that the annual cost which OSHA estimates are significantly lower than would be realized in practice Factors which APPA and EEI feel were not properly addressed include the following OSHA has not accurately accounted for cost of potential retroactive impacts including retrofitting and modifying existing installations and equipment OSHA has not consistently implemented performance based provisions in proposed rules  many portions require specific approaches which would require utilities to replace procedures already in place with new procedures Estimates were based on an average size investor-owned utility of 2,800 employees and an average rural cooperative of 56 employees, which are not applicable to many smaller systems such as municipal systems OSHA has not adequately addressed the retraining which would be necessary with modifying long-established industry practices to be in accordance with the OSHA rules EEI claims that OSHA's proposed clearance requirements would not allow the use of established maintenance techniques for maintaining high voltage transmission systems and thus would require new techniques For an example of the cost which is estimated to be experienced as a result of the new Rules one of the EEI member companies has estimated that approximately 20,000 transmission towers would need to be modified to accommodate the required step bolts in the Rules at an estimated cost of 6,200,000 Additionally this same company estimates that the annual cost of retesting live line tools for its estimated 1,000 tools would be 265,000 Additionally, both EEI and APPA question the additional benefits which OSHA claims would result from implementation of the new Rules APPA questions the estimates of preventing an additional 24 to 28 fatalities annually and 2,175 injuries per year in that it fails to account for the fact that the industry has already implemented in large part safety measures which are incorporated in the Rules EEI and APPA also point out that many preventable injuries cannot be eliminated despite work rules enforcement and safety awareness campaigns since many such accidents which result in fatalities are due to employee being trained but not following the employer's training and policies PRESENT STATUS OF RULES According to information received from the OSHA office in February 1993 the final Rules are to be published no later than July 1993 and possibly as soon as March 1993 OSHA closed their receipt of comments in March 1991 and no further changes in the rules are thought possible A2-20 


CONCLUSION The OSHA 1910.269 which proposes to cover electric utility operation and maintenance work rules affects a multitude of working procedures as are summarized in this paper It is not possible at the present time to assess the final structure of the Rules as may be proposed in 1993 or subsequent years Since the comments from the utility associations APPA and EEI were made following the initial release of the proposed OSHA Rules in 1989 a significant amount of time has elapsed where other events have occurred which may affect the form of the final Rules The 1993 NESC went into effect in August 1992 and includes some of the requirements to which the commenters objected For example a significant requirement in the Part 4 of the 1993 NESC requires that rubber gloves be utilized on exposed energized parts of facilities operating at 50 to 300 volts This requirement is in conflict with EEl\222s proposed change to the OSHA Rules which would still allow working such secondary facilities without the use of rubber gloves Electric utilities are advised to review the January 31 1989 proposed operation and maintenance Rules as summarized in this paper and to review their procedures which would be affected by application of the Rules Many of the procedures proposed in the Rules provide valuable guidance in electric utilities\222 operation and maintenance activities Where the cost impact is not significant, it is recommended that utilities consider implementing such procedures in expectation of the Rules being published in the next few months Also it would be appropriate for electric utilities to review the 1993 edition of the NESC since there are portions of the Rules which have resulted in changes in the NESC These changes mainly occur in Part 4 Rules for the Operation of Electric Supply and Communications Lines and Equipment The concerns which the commenters have addressed regarding the cost impact and the resulting benefits experienced as a result of the promulgation of the Rules are real ones and must be addressed in the final Rules As a result this paper cannot present a conclusion regarding the full impact of the Rules The development of such Rules continue to be an ongoing matter and will undoubtedly require later analysis when the final rules are published A2-21
