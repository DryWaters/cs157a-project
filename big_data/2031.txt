tracking and analysis of patient data. This study demonstrates how disease data tracking can help in understanding underlying patterns in chronic disease progression. Latent Growth Modeling \(LGM\ is used as a tool to analyze the long term chronic data related to the progression of Multiple Sclerosis \(MS The survey data has been collected on a bi-annual basis by the North Amer ican Research Committee on Multiple Sclerosis \(NARCOMS\, a project of the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers for the purpose of clinical trial recruitment and epidemiological research. This data set allows for 
study of MS progression, by measuring three base models: Patient Determined Disease Steps \(PDDS Overall Health and Emotional Health. MS patient data are grouped as early, middle and late disease status. This study analyzes three temporal data points spanning three years and identifies patient traits that are both patient and physician controlled. Empirical evidence confirms many practitioner observations  1  Introduction Health Care and the medical profession have historically focused its attention and efforts toward the patient s current conditions and what can 
immediately be accomplished to correct those conditions. The collection of data and information across a wider spectrum has prompted a shift to a greater emphasis on preventive measures that improve individual chances to forestall or even eliminate the emergence of adverse conditions Chronic disease management can especially benefit from long term tracking and analysis of patient conditions. In this context, the application of analytic methods capable of assessing the long term nature of chronic disease progression is still an emerging area 
of research. While representation and measurement of change over time is a fundamental concern to practically all scientific disciplines ron i c  disease tracking and analysis presents some unique challenges and requirements for analysis. Analysis of disease progression requires the incorporation of individual differences in conditions, disease history treatment options and lifestyle choices.  These conditions incorporate individual change over time and allow the identification of factors that make individuals perceive their health status as 
better or worse The analysis time frame should be able to include time frames ranging from weeks to years between assessments The primary objective of this research is to demonstrate the application of Latent Growth Modeling \(LGM\s a viable technique to analyze chronic disease data spanning multiple years. LGM is a technique used in longitudinal experiments when assessing a specific condition and factors that change 
those conditions. The specific condition is modeled as a linear function specifying the slope and intercept of the line \(with other representations possible\he factors are considered covariates that modify the slope or intercept of the line. LGM has the benefit of incorporating individual differences in the analysis of a variety of conditions that historically could only be analyzed as a group. We use LGM as a valuable Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 1 978-0-7695-3450-3/09 $25.00 © 2009 IEEE 
 


technique to investigate a large dataset of multiple sclerosis \(MS\atients. MS fits well within this type of analysis due to the life-long nature of the disease Our goal was to empirically analyze the impact of patient activity, treatments and other demographic variables such as age, race and gender, and associated life style choices on patient self reported health condition. Patient success at choosing certain life style and treatment programs through understanding the long term effects of MS can motivate patients with other diseases to search for guidance from similar studies of their own diseases The context of the multiple sclerosis study is first discussed in terms of the dataset and the patient participants. The basic application of LGM to multiple sclerosis is then discussed followed by the results of the LGM models. Finally, the implications of LGM use are addressed in the broader health care context along with the conclusions 2  Multiple Sclerosis Context Multiple sclerosis \(MS\s a neurological disease that can be diagnosed in early childhood or infancy The rate of disease progression for patients extends for many years and does not generally shorten an individual s lifespan. While MS is not the cause of death, the quality of life for patients in terms of mobility is affected. Mobility is severely affected in the late stages of the disease and patients progress more rapidly to the final disease stages once reaching a certain stage of mobility The North American Research Committee on Multiple Sclerosis \(NARCOMS\as tracked longterm disease progression over several years through a patient provided data set. The survey conducted by NARCOMS is administered every six months with a respondent population ranging from 8,000 to over 10,000 MS patients for the three year study period The NARCOMS database includes patients as young as age 12 with 25% of the MS population below the age of 32. One of the key data points of the survey is a 9 point scale indicating the Patient Determined Disease Steps \(PDDS\oxy for progression of disease \(Table 1\. A significant sign of MS progression is the mobility of the patient and the PDDS scale measures decreased mobility through increasing scale item values The extended temporal nature of MS progression requires techniques that can incorporate patient selfreported disease status longitudinally. Latent Growth Modeling \(LGM\ides the benefits of representing the disease progression in multiple time frames and the impact of life style, treatment and fixed effects in the model. The advantages to LGM include greater flexibility in specification explicitness of all aspects of the model and the use of latent variable score estimates  Our goal is to present LGM as a valuable technique to the investigation of MS and other long term illnesses. Three base models will be presented in which the basic disease progression marker, PDDS, is used for the 1 st model. PDDS will be part of a latent variable termed Overall Health in the 2 nd model. The final base model will evaluate another latent variable that represents the Emotional Health of patients. Each of these three base models can identify patient differences in fixed effects \(age, sex, and race\fe style \(employment, income level\d treatment \(on drug therapy 3  Application of LGM for MS Latent Growth Modeling is a technique used in longitudinal experiments when assessing a specific condition and factors that change those conditions The use of LGM requires a dataset that has been collected consistently over the course of multiple assessments. These assessment periods can be over the course of a few months to multi-year assessments that span decades. Some examples of LGM application include a change in alcohol use that was assessed every six months for participants that were randomly assigned to three separate treatment Table 1 - PDDS Question Value Meaning 0 Normal mild symptoms, mostly sensory 1 Mild  Disability some symptoms, minor lifestyle effect 2 Moderate  Disability No walking limitation, some daily activity limit 3 Gait  Disability Walking and activity interference, athletic activities are demanding 4 Early  Cane Cane, Crutch or other support used, can walk 25  5 Late  Cane Must have support to walk 25  6 Bilateral  Support 2 canes/crutches or walker to walk 25  7 Wheelchair/Scooter Main form of mobility 8 Bedridden Unable to sit in wheelchair for 1 hour This Scale focuses mainly on how well you walk Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 2

The measurement points are represented by Time 1 through Time 3. Data collection must include respondents from each time period. The linear equation is assumed to have the same intercept for all time periods and is represented in the model by the 1 s going from the intercept to each time period. Linear Growth, or Slope, in the case of MS is interpreted as disease progression. The initial assumption is that the disease progresses in a linear fashion, as opposed to a quadratic fashion. This assumption is represented by the path coefficients of 0, 1 and 2 leading from the Slope to each of the time periods 1, 2 and 3. The base models would have no Covariate included. When the Covariates are added to the model, the path coefficients leading from the Covariate would represent either positive or negative directional changes to the Intercept and Slope. Model fit statistics provide a measure of how good the assumptions are represented by the LGM The dataset provided by NARCOMS included 3,774 patient respondents across six survey time periods that included: 1\all 2004 \(F04\2\pring 2005 \(S05\all 2005 \(F05\pring 2006 \(S06 5\all 2006 \(F06\, and 6\pring 2007 \(S07\. The population demographics are presented in Table 2 On average, the patient respondents have been living with MS for 15 years since diagnosis and 23 years since the onset of symptoms. Females in the population outnumber males three to one. MS seems to be racially discriminant with 93.6% of the study participants reporting their race as white The timeline for disease progression is known to be different for early vs. later stages of MS i n c e  one of the goals of this study is to investigate these different disease progressi on stages, Table 2 also provides a division of the population that may be in either an early, middle or late stage of MS. The early stage is defined as anyone on the PDDS scale of 0, 1 or 2. The middle stage is defined as answers of 3, 4 or 5 and the late stage consists of answers of 6, 7 or 8. This division was based on the respondent answers to the PDDS question for the survey administered in Fall of 2005. The resulting three groups represent different sample sizes of the original 3,774 respondents. The three PDDS partitioned groups total 3,753 respondents. There were 21 respondents that had missing data for part of the LGMs tested. The data for these respondents was removed Approximately 35% of the respondents are on some form of drug therapy. In addition, 35% of the population is employed with 98% of the population having some form of Health Insurance. The ~ symbol indicates that these percentages are approximated across the six survey timelines since the PDDS answers, as well as drug therapy, employment and health insurance, can change from survey to survey The latent variables, Overall Health and Emotional Health, each include four scale items. In addition to the 9 item PDDS scale, the remaining three scale items included were labeled mobility Mobility\moderate activity \(Mod Act\d climbing stairs \(Climb Strs\bility is a 7 point Table 2 - MS Patient Respondent Demographics N Female White Employed 3774 74.9% 93.6% ~ 35  Age Diag Onset Health Ins 53.21 38.74 30.64 ~ 98  Early PDDS Mid PDDS Late PDDS Drug Therapy 31 40 29 35  Intercept Time 1 Time 3 Slope Time 2 0 1 2 1 1 1 Covariate Figure 1 - Latent Growth Model Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 3

The Emotional Health latent variable included: Accomplished Emotional \(Acc Emot Careful Emotional \(C Emot\alm \(Calm\ and Depression \(Depress\All of the Emotional Health items are on a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 indicating All of the time and 5 indicating None of the time Acc Emot asks if the patient accomplished less than they would have liked and C Emot asked if the patient Didn t do work as carefully as usual The Calm scale item asked if the patient felt calm and peaceful while the Depress item asked Have you felt downhearted and depressed PDDS, Mobility and Calm are all reverse coded with higher numbered responses indicating disease progression or negative effects To validate the increasing progression between the three groups, three LGMs were used to assess these changes. For the first LGM, only the scale item PDDS was used from the surveys of S05, S06 and S07.  The same surveys were used to run the LGM for Overall Health and Emotional Health. The PDDS and OH base models both indicate a more rapid increase in disease progression in group 3 when compared to group 1. The Emotional Health base model provides a more stable picture of the patients Figure 2 - LGM Base Models\he presentation of the fit statistics for the base models can be found in Table 3.

 OH Base OH S   OH I Figure 3 Covariate Modifications 4  Results - Covariate Modifications to Disease Progression Examples of the covariates for this study include age, employment status and income.  The inclusion of independent variables, and their effect on the dependent variable, is only assessed after the relationship between the covariates and dependent variables are remove C o v a riates are u s ed i n  LGM to determine modifications to either intercept or slope Figure 3 Covariate Modifications demonstrates the anticipated modifications to the linear progression of MS based on a single covariate The Overall Health Base model discussed previously is represented by the decreasing line labeled OH base  All modifications are premised from this base line. A covariate that adjusts the base model line may have the effect statistically of modifying the slope or disease development of Overall Health either positively or negatively. The covariate may also be associated with a change in intercept, or starting point, either positively or negatively. Note that these associations do not necessarily imply causation. The hypothesized representational changes in Figure 3  Covariate Modifications indicate that, from the base linear disease progression line \(OH Base a negative intercept change, line OH I represents a lower Overall Health starting point with no slope change or rate of disease progression. A positive slope change or reduced rate of disease progression, is represented by the line OH S  When assessing the effects of covariates on MS disease progression, a consistent modification of either the disease starting level or disease progression advancement is searched for across the three groups of MS assessment respondents.  Tables have been constructed to assist in the identification of the consistency of covariate associated adjustments to the base model characteristics. Tables 4 and 5 are constructed to present the results of covariates on the Emotional Health and Overall Health of each group The consistency of the results is determined when a single covariate has the same effect across all three groups for either Overall or Emotional Health. These effects may be either a significant positive/negative slope change or a significant positive/negative intercept change Age Effects of MS The expectations of disease progression may vary based on several views of a patient s age. Since MS is not a curable disease, part of the goal is to provide MS patients with a life style that is as close to normal as possible. Three views of the patient s age are used as covariates: Age, Age @ Diagnosis and Age @ Onset. For these LGMs, Age is simply defined as the patient s birth age. The Age Diagnosis is the age at which a medical professional has confirmed that the patient does in fact have MS Once this confirmation has occurred, life prior to the Age @ Diagnosis is reviewed. This review allows the patient to determine at which point in their life they can recognize the onset of symptoms of MS. This will then determine the covariate referred to as the Age @ Onset. Each of these covariates is used to assess their adjustment on the base LGM models 1  An analysis of these covariates for all three groups is summarized in Table 4. The initial covariate \(Age\ndicates that, as an individual increases with Age, their Overall Health decreases as depicted by a positive increase in their Intercept. This covariate is the only one that indicates a consistent directional adjustment across all three groups. A graphical representation of this modification is provided in Figure 4 - Age Intercept Modification The change over time or slope shows a positive increase only for Groups 1 and 2 which would be considered the healthiest MS patients. Disease progression is more rapid for older patients than for younger patients For the Age @ Diagnosis, the individuals for Group 1 and 2 that were diagnosed later in life exhibit a more advanced disease starting point. The starting point for Overall Health of these older    1  Only the fit statistics for the base model have been provided due to space constraints.

patients does not indicate any change in the rate of their disease progression. The only significant covariate for Age @ Onset was with Group 1 which indicated a reduction in the disease progression rate for the most capably active Group 1 patients. This specifies that the older patients are before getting  the disease symptoms, the slower the disease progresses through the rest of their life With the Emotional Health assessment, positive increases in slope and intercept would indicate an improvement in the Emotional Health of the patient None of the Age associated covariates exhibited consistent results across all three of the study groups Group 1 had the most significant results indicating that: 1\ the starting point of Emotional Health for the patient decreased with age; 2\crease in Age Onset indicated both a positive increase of the starting point and positive slope improvement for Emotional Health. The group three Age model did not converge \(DNC\, patients in Group 3 showed a deteriorated Emotional Health in relation to Age @ diagnosis Life Style and MS The early stages of MS are noted for how a patient is willing to continue to be active and productive in their lives. The activity and productivity of MS patients in these LGMs are indicated through their Income level where increasing selections of this categorical variable indicates higher levels of income. Employment Status is operationalized as a dichotomous variable of either Yes \(0\ \(1 2     2  The fit statistics for the models of these Life Style effects can be requested from the authors The Employment Status intercept was the only covariate to exhibit consistency across all three groups \(Table 5\This consistent relationship indicated that those who were employed had better Overall Health. However, the early stages of disease progression represented by Group 1 and 2 showed consistent patterns across both Employment status and Income level for Overall Health. Improved starting points in Overall Health are associated with those MS patients who are able to continue to work This effect was further supported as the income level of the MS patients increased. The higher the MS patient income levels were, the more improved the Overall Health starting point became. For Group 1 and 2, these life style covariates exhibited no change in the rate of disease progression. Group 3 exhibited significant modifications only for their Employment Status. These modifications were both positive in their starting point for Overall Health and a decreased rate of disease progression. For Group 3, continued employment is associated with slower disease progression  Table 4 - Age Covariate Effects  Type Group Age Age  @ Onset Age @ Diagnosis Intercept Adjust Slope Adjust Intercept Adjust Slope Adjust Intercept Adjust Slope Adjust Overall Health 1 Positive  Positive  No Effect  Negative Positive No Effect 2 Positive Positive No Effect No Effect Positive No Effect 3 Positive No Effect No Effect No Effect No Effect No Effect  Emotional Health 1 Positive No Effect Positive Negative No Effect No Effect 2 No Effect No Effect No Effect No Effect No Effect No Effect 3 DNC DNC No Effect No Effect No Effect No Effect  Overall Health is reduced for those who are older OH Base  OH I Figure 4 - Age Intercept Modification  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 
 


For Emotional Health, the starting point for MS was significantly related by both Employment status and Income for all three groups and in the same directions for all three groups. MS Patients who were employed had improved Emotional Health and were associated with additional Emotional Health benefits as their income increased \(Figure 5 - Emotional Health Income/Employed Covariate\The rate of Emotional health change was significant only for Group 2 with the Income covariate. For this group, as their income increased their Emotional Health exhibited a reduction compared with those of lower Income levels Drug Therapy Effectiveness Whether a patient enters into a drug treatment therapy is a decision made under the consultation of a physician. There are multiple categories of drug therapies available. The data available for this investigation was a dichotomous variable indicating only whether the patient was participating in a drug treatment therapy or not. Generally, when a MS patient begins a drug treatment therapy, they continue for extended periods of time. Switching drugs during this time period is common. However, the drugs available during this analysis time period are equivalent in efficacy and therefore appropriate to compare patient status of either on or off drug therapy. The patient data used for these LGMs were checked to insure that patients included as on Drug Therapy for the target survey of spring 2006 were also on drug therapy for Spring 2005 and Spring 2007 The significance of this covariate \(Table 5\was inconsistent across the groups for Overall Health However, for those significant relationships, the consistent message was that being on drug therapy was not associated with an improvement in the patient s condition when compared to the base model. Group 2 and 3 both showed an association with improved Overall Health \(intercept\when compared to those patients not on drug therapies Group 1 showed an improved disease progression slope\or those not on drug therapies. Emotional Health was consistent for all three groups in that being on Drug Therapy did not affect their Emotional Health stability. However, mixed results for each group resulted in their starting points of Emotional Health. For Group 1 and 3, being on drug therapy was positively related with improved Emotional Health. Group 2, in contrast, showed a negative relationship in Emotional Health when they were on drug therapy Table 5 - Employment/Income & Drug Therapy Covariates Type Group Employment Status Income Drug Therapy Intercept Adjust Slope Adjust Intercept Adjust Slope Adjust Intercept Adjust Slope Adjust Overall Health 1 Pos No Effect Neg No Effect No Effect Neg 2 Pos No Effect Neg No Effect Neg No Effect 3 Pos Neg No Effect No Effect Neg No Effect Emotional Health 1 Neg No Effect Pos No Effect Pos No Effect 2 Neg No Effect Pos Neg Neg No Effect 3 Neg No Effect Pos No Effect Pos No Effect  Emotional Health was better for those who were employed EH Base  EH I  Figure 5 - Emotional Health Income/Employed Covariate  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 
 


5  Implications of LGM to Health Care Context The application of LGM to the NARCOMS dataset brings out the importance of this technique not only for MS, but for multiple health care contexts. This initial analysis of MS growth factors highlight individual patient differences that are controllable \(job status and drug therapy\ and are not controllable \(age\ of the covariates explained individual differences within the three groups of patients analyzed. Specific improvements in Overall Health and Emotional Health could be anticipated with the patient s determination of staying employed or seeking some form of drug therapy. These results were reached with an investigation using three data points across a three year time span of assessment and making a basic assumption of linearity in the dataset. The possible insights to be gained of the NARCOMS dataset, and other health care datasets can be extended through the use of more complex specifically targeted LGM models The assumption of linearity for any disease context should always be questioned. There are often triggers that occur in a patients disease progression that hastens the advancement of the disease. LGM allows the ability of the slope function to be determined by the dataset under investigation. A simple model determining the slope would allow the calculation of the third time periods slope function Any result indicating a non-linear function would then more accurately be termed a shape function The determination of the true shape of the curve may require more data points for this unspecified growth function. Guidance on the number of data points required is available from Tisak and Meredith d  Burchinal and Applebaum h e s h ape of g r o w t h  over time can therefore be specified as either quadratic, cubic or left unspecified The change over time or shape of the curve, of any disease may vary between two multiple assessment periods. A Piece-wise LGM may be applied to determine a linear growth that exists in the first assessment period \(three data points\ while a quadratic growth may exist in the second assessment period \(three data points  T h es e periods m a y be separated by age, treatment or some other distinguishable variable. LGM also allows and Accelerated Design model in which cohorts can be sequentially modeled in order to form a common developmental trajectory of growth. This cohortsequential design t h e cas e o f M S an d t h e  NARCOMS dataset, can allow the three groups early, middle and late disease progression sequentially modeled to provide a clearer interpretation of the rapid advance of the late stages of the disease. This design is referred to as accelerated since the data from the different cohorts was collected during a shortened or identical time period The inclusion of additional covariates and application of models with greater complexity can provide even greater insights into the shape of MS progression and how predictors can modify that shape. The importance of treatment and life style interventions that improve the overall and emotional health of MS patients, as identified through the various LGM techniques, can allow patients to enact and their physicians to recommend positive life style changes 6  Conclusions The analysis of the NARCOMS dataset for MS patients included three cohorts at different disease stages and four covariates in the investigation of the linear progression of MS. Each covariate provided an indication of some linear modification of either overall or emotional health of the patient. The extended nature of the disease, an individual s lifetime, would indicate that a three year assessment period is small compared to the length of time individuals live with the disease. However, even in the abbreviated time period of this study, LGM has demonstrated that controllable influences in an individual s life can restrain progression of the disease. Though a control group of the normal population was not analyzed, it is safe to say that the health declines as individuals advance in age Extending this study to assess the differences between MS patients and a normal population could bring greater understanding of the potential intervention effects for MS patients In a broader context, LGM can make use of existing datasets that allow the modeling of patients with long term diseases such as cancer, diabetes heart disease and many more. LGM can model patients grouped as long term survivors of heart disease to analyze their life styles and treatments to inform new patients of the most effective steps to take to insure their continued life style. An accelerated LGM design, including a cohort of heart design survivors and a cohort of individuals at risk can initially begin to investigate predictive covariates that further reduces the risk of heart disease for those individuals at risk Diabetes research could be enhanced by an LGM investigation that analyzes the trigger events that place Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 
 


individuals on insulin. Covariates that enhance the life and life styles can provide better medical care and reduce long term expenses for both the health care sector and the private consumers Achieving these goals does require a long term view for the collection of data. NARCOMS has a dataset much larger than was currently available for study. Recent efforts are underway to consolidate all of the NARCOMS data in a central repository in order to mine their data for up to a ten year period Improvements in the ability to assess additional covariates would require the inclusion of specific treatments. These treatments could be physical therapy, drug therapy or social interventions. Data cleansing techniques should be used when scales have been adjusted for survey questions. Finally, care must be taken to insure the privacy of all participants Yet, for LGM to be useful to health care research each assessment must continue to capture and link the patient s data in order to shape the progression of any long term disease in order to assess beneficial predictive variables 7  References 1.

Figure 15  ISM Data Flow serializer highlighted in yellow the design to ensure the clock-to-outputs of the individual serial signals were all matched indicating that at least on chip the design had no skew Finally we used a test bed layout with HyperLynx to prove that our part to part latencies were within acceptable ranges given the high design speed FPGA Design Rate The FPGA design used to verify the design speed was a relatively simple 8-bit latch and shift register shown in Figure 14 Figure 14 shows that the base clock is twice as fast as the output clock which is meant to simulate a recovered clock This is not necessarily a design requirement but would be necessary if the telemetry clock were an input to the design as was the case on the WISE mission This implies that the maximum frequency given by the timing tool for the design is twice the output clock Figure 14 shows only an 8-bit shift register but naturally depending on how the memory was organized more might be required The more bits used in the shift register the more internal clock skew slows the design If a wider bus were required it would be better to increase the depth of the input registers to maintain a high-speed design as opposed to increasing the number of output shift registers The results of this test were a maximum device clock speed of 336.7 MHz double data rate and a maximum output clock speed of 168.35 MHz in the Actel RTAX2000S as given by Actel Timing Designer This meets our requirement of 150 MHz on the clock signal with a margin of 12 FPGA Design Skew Using this same prototype design and mapping the outputs to physical pins we ensured the pin-to-pin skew was matched This skew is the amount of time it takes the edge to propagate from the internal logic to the physical pin on the part The results were as follows Path 1 gse clk:CLK to GSE CLK P Clock to Out ns 7.014 Path 2 gse clk:CLK to GSE CLK N Clock to Out ns 7.014 Path 3 gse data:CLK to GSE DATA P Clock to Out ns 7.014 Path 4 gse data:CLK to GSE DATA N Clock to Out ns 7.014 The clock-to-output skews are all matched indicating the clock and data signals leave the part simultaneously and no delay is caused by mismatched skew Board Latency Simulation After a preliminary board layout was completed board simulations were performed on the signals from the FPGA to the LVDS repeater and ultimately to the front panel as shown in Figure 16 All of these simulations were performed in HyperLynx Boardsim 8.0 with manufacturer-provided IBIS models for the Integrated Circuits ICs The waveform given in Figure 17 is captured at the FPGA Figure 16  ISM Data Flow buffer highlighted in yellow Figure 17  FPGA LVDS output waveform simulations green/red  single-ended clock at FPGA blue  differential clock at destination The HyperLynx simulation was performed using a signal switching speed of 180 MHz to ensure adequate margin for the desired signal frequencies The rise times given in Table 9 are roughly one-tenth the simulated signal period 5.5 ns at 180 Mhz indicating they will not impede the switching frequency by slowing the time to the threshold voltage at the receiver The simulated scope shots for these signals indicate crisp edges and transitions The receiving part is an LVDS bus repeater meant to protect the radiation-hardened FPGA from any front-panel transients that might inadvertently occur during testing At the input to the repeater the simulated signal waveform is given in Figure 18 The transition regions for LVDS are shown as blue lines in Figure 18 While there is a considerable amount of overshoot 11 


Figure 18  LVDS signals at buffer input difference shown and re\003ections on the signal line from the repeater the transition region of the signal is very clean even simulated at 180 MHz This will easily meet our 150 MHz frequency requirement Signal characteristics are tabulated in Table 9 Signal Rise Time ps Fall Time ps Undershoot mV Overshoot mV Margin mV CLK 729.0 698.4 212 250 288 CLK903.1 685.4 256 150 244 DATA 738.9 702.8 216 250 284 DATA876.4 717.8 256 150 244 Table 9  FPGA LVDS output signal characteristics In addition to signal characteristics and waveforms the signal-to-signal skew was measured at the buffer input Obviously these values should be as small as possible to prevent modifying the board Like most differential signaling modes LVDS requires matched impedance signal pairs to function optimally HyperLynx was used to 002ne tune the termination on each differential pair and to match all of the trace impedances to this termination The skew was minimal Table 10 First LVDS Signal Second LVDS Signal Receiving Rise Skew ps Receiving Fall Skew ps CLK DATA 58.32 50.54 Table 10  LVDS rising and falling skew measured at receiver The Receiving Rise and Fall skews are the values for skew between the two signals as each signal passes the LVDS threshold voltage measured at the FPGA The time difference between these two crossings is the number shown in Table 10 Rise skew is measured on the rising edge and fall skew is measured on the falling edge as illustrated in Figure 19 Figure 19  LVDS receiver slew measurement Given that these skews were measured at 180 MHz skew between signals at 150 MHz will not inhibit data transfer by allowing the clock and data lines to get out of sync 6 C ONCLUSIONS It is clear that there are many places where timing is of great concern in the ISM data 003ow The initial data input is driven by the instrument interface timing the bandwidth of the FPGA FIFO buffers the speed of the formatter FPGA and the bandwidth of write accesses to the 003ash-memory The transmitter side of the data 003ow is dependent on the bandwidth of the read accesses to the 003ash-memory the FPGA FIFO buffer bandwidth the FPGA serializer frequency and the physical signal characteristics of the FPGA to the frontpanel interface A table summarizing all of these bandwidths in the order they occur in the data 003ow is presented in Table 11 Data Flow Block Bandwidth Units INSTRUMENT INPUT FPGA FIFO Buffer Rd BW 1080 Mbps Formatter FPGA Bandwidth 328 Mbps Flash-memory Write Bandwidth 104 Mbps TRANSMITTER OUTPUT Flash-memory Read Bandwidth 866 Mbps FPGA FIFO Buffer Rd BW 1080 Mbps FPGA Serializer Bandwidth 168 Mbps Table 11  Bandwidth summary In order to support our study signal integrity analysis was performed on the portions of the data 003ow affected by physical delays including into and out of the 003ash-memory and from the FPGA to the front panel These physical interfaces are robust enough to support high data throughput rates The ISM is capable of interfacing to an instrument with up to 104 Mbps of continuous data throughput and is capable of 12 


sourcing data to a transmitter at a bandwidth up to 168 Mbps This allows data to be stored to the ISM during the orbital encounter period and downlinked periodically as communications are available R EFERENCES  223R T AX-S/SL RadT olerant FPGAs 224 Actel Corporation Mountain View CA 2008 A v ailable http://www.actel.com/products/milaero/rtaxs/docs.aspx  223Prototyping R T AX-S Using Axcelerator Devices,\224 2003 A v ailable http://www.actel.com/techdocs/appnotes/rtaxs.aspx  223K9XXG08XXM Datasheet 2G x 8 Bit  4G x 8 Bit  8G x 8 Bit NAND Flash Memory,\224 Samsung Electronics 2007  223UT54A CS164245S/SE Schmitt CMOS 16-bit Bidirectional MultiPurpose Transceiver Datasheet,\224 Aero\003ex Corporation Colorado Springs CO 2009 Available http://aero\003ex.com/ams/pagesproduct/prodshirel-16bitlogic.cfm B IOGRAPHY  John Dickinson is a Research Engineer at Southwest Research Institute Having studied Electrical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University with a focus on control systems and signals he began work at SwRI in the Avionics Systems Group of the Space Science and Engineering Division He was the lead Ground Support Equipment GSE Test Engineer for the WISE and Kepler Mission Unique Boards MUB for which he compiled and integrated the GSE hardware developed the test scripts and wrote and veri\002ed the GSE code He is the Lead Engineer for the JUNO JADE Instrument Processor Board a lowpower RAD-HARD 3U Compact PCI single-board computer that utilizes the Atmel LEON2 SPARC v8 processor and provides direct instrument and spacecraft serial interfaces He has supported integration systems engineering and promotional efforts on a variety of programs and is currently pursuing a Master's Degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology Charlie Howard  a Principal Engineer in the Department of Space Systems at Southwest Research Institute excels as system architect and digital designer with particular expertise in FPGA and ASIC design Mr Howard has 002lled an active role in the hardware/software architecture for the MMS Mass Memory Module MMM and is the designer of the Mass Memory Controller FPGA Mr Howard is the architect and designer of WISE Mission Unique Board MUB the Kepler Command and Telemetry Board CTB and the Orbital Express CTB and provided multiple FPGA designs for OE Kepler WISE and MMS As Kepler CTB lead he incorporated new simulation capabilities allowing the customer to verify advanced features of the Kepler CTB prior to delivery As an ASIC and FPGA designer Mr Howard 002lled roles in RTL design functional and gate level veri\002cation for high reliability systems including space telecom and defense applications His other interests are worst-case timing and signal integrity analyses Steven Torno is an Electrical Engineer at Southwest Research Institute He studied Electrical Engineering at the Rose-Hulman Institute for Technology with a focus on digital signal processing and he began work at SwRI in the Avionics Systems Group of the Space Science and Engineering Division in 2009 He was the Ground Support Equipment GSE Test Engineer for a Control and Telemetry Board CTB demo in partnership with ATK Space Systems where he integrated existing GSE hardware with custom test software he wrote and veri\002ed He is currently an Electrical Engineer for the Robotic Lander Test Bed project working on the Low Voltage Power Supply LVPS board He is currently pursuing a Master's Degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Texas at San Antonio 13

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
