INTRODUCTION  This paper presents Improved Decision support System IDSS Mobile, Tactical and Fixed IP network environments IDSS enables convergence of the Sensors &amp; the Sensor Web Enablement \(SWE deployed IP networks. IDSS enables automated detection and response for scenarios involving Connectivity &amp Communications, Physical-Security, Surveillance, Sensorbased monitoring and Perimeter-Security etc. IDSS is designed to be a low-footprint, embedded-systems solution that does not require large servers. IDSS can also serve as an information-aggregator or a proxy to the SWE infrastructure \(deployed at regional and global facilities monitoring several remote sites. IDSS provides the ability to glue together the disparate sensors, devices and systems in a portable and emergency-grade, first responder IP network solutions. IDSS, at a remote \(or mobile serves as an automated closed-loop control system for

IDSS bridges SONA and SOA  Service Oriented Network Architecture \(SONA  defined by Cisco Systems is an open framework to integrate network-based services with business applications. SONA suggests a three-layer framework by sandwiching the concept of an interactive services layer between web-applications and the networked infrastructure. IDSS serves as the glue  services layer   connecting networked sensors, actuators and local systems command and control applications with the Services Oriented Architecture \(SOA upstream applications such as SWE components. Open Geospatial Consortium  s \(OGC SOA and support web-services based integration. These SOA services are reusable software components that exploit semantic web with well-defined and standardscompliant interfaces  76978-1-4244-4586-8/09/$25.00  2009 IEEE IDSS facilitates the integration of legacy \(or IP enabled sensors with SOA enabled applications. Typical mobile network systems only serve as a communication and connectivity enabler for the First-responders, and remote military and civilian installation etc. IDSS \(deployed on an embedded system enables  integrated network-kits  tailored for use in Telemedicine, Emergency-grade networks, Mining, DODintelligence communities, automated remote locations and similar applications. The main focus of IDSS is to enable local detection and response capabilities in a selfcontained environment. IDSS integration with the OGC  s SWE architecture can allow visibility of local sensors and control through regional or global SWE components  IDSS serves as a bridge between the locally connected sensors and the systems that require sensor data. For example, IDSS implements sensor drivers to connect the chemical sensors at a remote facility and continuously monitor the chemical levels \(such as CO, O2, H2S, VOC LEL notification to local operations center and raises the alarm on the alarm-panels. It also sends the information to the plume-modeling system that predicts the impacted zones IDSS can then fetch that information and generate OASIS 2] Common Alerting Protocol \(CAP the mass notification systems over IP network to provide necessary information to the first-responders and evacuation notices. The ability to integrate the sensors and the modeling system in this example allows rapid nearreal time response and provides actionable information to the decision makers. IDSS allows the administrators to define the workflow consisting of conditions and actions using predefined set of sensors and systems. Based on the integrated devices as a part of deployment, the IDSS understands the capabilities of the connected sensors and systems. The layered architecture of IDSS allows the abstraction of the different states that a sensor or a system could follow. The administrators can build conditions and actions by assigning thresholds to the sensors to define the conditions that trigger an action \(or a response function of IDSS as an improved decision support system results from its ability to automate the standard operating procedures  IDSS is useful in emergency situation as well as day-today operations. For example, a remote location that needs 


day operations. For example, a remote location that needs environment monitoring, building management or automated controls can used IDSS to enable a closed-loop control system. For example, IDSS implements Modbus TCP protocol [3] for controlling the Analog &amp; Digital I/O Relays etc. Several legacy sensors provide data as analog values. This capability can be used to remotely monitor &amp control Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning HVAC relays that are often deployed with sensors to remotely monitor their power status. Similarly the actuators can be triggered using predefined analog or digital I/O. IDSS allows the controls of these devices based on the predefined conditions defined by the IDSS administrators  The multiple IDSS systems can be setup to integrate and push the aggregated local sensor information into OGS SWE infrastructure  OGC SWE standards-based implementation already supports aggregating information from multiple databases As an  example National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \(NOAA System \(IOOS SWE interoperable access to multiple online databases [4  2. UNDERLYING REMOTE IP NETWORK TOPOLOGY  All Sensors, Actuators, Devices and Systems connect over the IP network. IP network reach-ability and connectivity between the IP enabled nodes depends on the underlying IP network design, architecture and topologies. It  s important to highlight some basics information about a remote network, before reviewing the advantages of connecting the remote sensors to the centrally deployed SWE components, through an intermediate IDSS system  Typical IP network system design has two sides - Local Area Network \(WAN WAN The LAN and WAN sides are connected through a router As per the RFC1918 - address allocation for private internets [5], IP nodes on the LAN typically only require intra-enterprise communications and often do not need direct access from internet and therefore allocated private address. The scarcity of public IP addresses forced bestpractices that promoted the use of private IP addresses on the LAN side  Table 1. Address Allocation for Private Internets    These private addresses are reserved for private LAN and therefore not routed over the internet. This implies that computers on public internet can not directly reach the sensors on assigned private IP address on LAN 77 WANside needs public IP address to connect over the internet using Virtual Private Networks \(VPN  s harder for organizations to acquire additional address in public IP space due to growth of the Internet and its increasing globalization. RFC1466 Error! Reference source not found. provides guidelines for management of public IP Address Space. In the IDSS solutions the WAN side is allocated a public IP address by the respective serviceprovider. Thus only a single Public IP address can be sufficient for the entire IDSS solution. IP routers that are used in the IDSS solutions, also provide several features to secure and route IP packets between the LAN and the 


to secure and route IP packets between the LAN and the WAN sides  One of the most frequently used features on routers is IP Network Address Translation \(NAT  provides details on IP Network Address Translator \(NAT Terminology and Considerations. In summary, NAT allows the nodes on the private LAN to connect to the nodes on the Public WAN or the Internet. RFC2993 [8 clearly outlines the architectural implications including the advantages and problems with NAT in an IP network topology. Some of these NAT related problems \(as defined in RFC2993  Table 2. IP NAT related networking issues    Similar to the IP Network Address Translation \(NAT issues, the IP network Firewall is also enabled on the IP routers to block external computers \(on insecure network such as internet Local Area Network  LAN The current SWE architecture does not explicitly consider these IP networking issues while suggesting the large scale integration of sensors for web-enablement Additionally it often presumes that smart sensors as  IP network servers    According to the internet terminology, a web-browser \(on a LAN based  client  that connects to a web-server \(TCP/IP network server pages. The  client  may reside behind an IP NAT router on LAN on the public internet connection to the  client  since the computer running the web-browser has a  private IP address    Similarly the, SWE components running at the regional or global data-centers cannot initiate a new TCP/IP connection to reach the sensors; if these sensors reside on a private IP address based Local Area Network \(LAN the remote networks  3. OGC SWE SERVICES INTERACTION OVER LOCAL AND REMOTE NETWORKS  The OGS-5 Team1451[9], implemented the integration and interoperability between IEEE 1451 smart sensors and OGC-SWE SOS service using Smart Transducer Web Service \(STWS IEEE 1451 and SWE. To understand the impact of the IP network on the protocols that connect the IEEE smart-sensors and the OGC-SWE components, an IP network platform \(basically a router representing a remote site on LAN On the WAN/Internet side  The capability exchange messages between IEEE smartsensors and OGC-SWE-SOS services are defined in the OpenGIS  Discussion Paper; reference number: OGC 06021r1 [10  SWE Sensor Observation Services \(SOS  role in providing access to observations from sensors and sensor systems, in a standard way that is consistent for all sensor systems including remote, in-situ, fixed and mobile sensors. Typically the SOS components at the Data-center use Pull-based methods to fetch the data from the remote sensors. For Pull-based method to work, the IP sensor and 


sensors. For Pull-based method to work, the IP sensor and local network router needs to be configured to allow access from centralized SOS components  SOS specification defines four profiles: Core Transactional, Enhanced, and Entire.  Several SOS commands use pull based. These are used to fetch the 78 sensor information. The Pull-bases services, initiated by the data-center based SOS client, fail to reach the sensors on the private LAN behind the NAT on the remote networks platforms  SOS-T \(Transactional for the remote smart-sensor nodes that cannot maintain a permanent network connection \(when using cellular or GSM based uplinks based commands are not blocked by the NAT routers  Table 3.  SWE SOS Client-Server Commands    The analysis of the scenarios in Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3, for IP connectivity \(No explicitly configured port forwarding  Table 4.  IP Network friendly recommendations    Network Capable Application Processor \(NCAP  compliant with IEEE 1451.x standards enables network centric capabilities for the smart-sensors.  NCAP standards allow for communication via the client/server protocol or publish/subscribe protocol. This flexibility makes it easy for network centric integration of the smart sensors. However most of the current work has used the NCAP for web-enabling the remote sensors as  IP network servers    Figure 1 shows the flow between sensor and the datacenter via the IP Network Platform \(IDSS Network Platform remote sensor nodes are on the private IP LAN across a satellite network, \(protected by firewall and IP NAT configured on the IP router SOS  Client  on the data-center will not be successful in initiating a TCP/IP connection to the SOS on IEEE Smart Sensor  In an ideal design, the TCP/IP socket connection should be initiated by the IEEE Smart Sensor. IEEE Smart Sensors should have the ability to function as  IP Network Clients    An alternative is to use an IDSS-like functionality at the remote-sites to  proxy  the sensor information. This proxy can feed data into the SWE-SOS components on behalf of multiple legacy and smart sensors at the remote site    Figure 1.  Information flow between sensor and the SWE Infrastructure via the remote IP Networks  The Figure 2 illustrates individual nodes inserting their observations into the main database via SOS-T Transactional very useful when node cannot keep a permanent network connection with the data center \(e.g. cellular links 


connection with the data center \(e.g. cellular links T interface certainly allows seamless data transfer from the remote-node across the satellite, cellular or other WAN networks. The NAT will not become a blocking factor for this implementation. One of the drawbacks in allowing centralized SWE components to manage the 79 sensing and response across high-latency WAN networks is the response-delay related issues    Figure 2. Individual nodes inserting their observations into the SWE database via SOS-T   SWE infrastructure at the central sites in this scenario cannot be effectively leveraged for  actuation  at the remote sites \(connected via satellite potential other WAN link-quality issues  Figure 3 shows the SOS capability exchange when a sensor is added to the OGC SWE system in a plug n  play fashion. The nodes on the private IP LAN network are not reachable due to IP NAT and Firewall configured on the IP network router    Figure 3. Capability exchange using SOS commands when a sensor is added in a plug n  play fashion    3.1. IDSS between Sensor and SWE components  IDSS network platforms combine the network-features with the application-features. An intermediate IDSS system between the legacy-sensors &amp; SWE components offers a single point of integration for multiple sensors behind the IDSS network. This also reduces the need for upgrading the legacy-sensors to the next-generation smartsensors at the existing remote sites. IDSS implementation also abstracts the legacy sensor information into SWE compliant web-services  Effective and non-blocking protocols between the sensors and SWE architecture will allow more flexible usage of SWE components in mobile and tactical environment This helps to connect a large volume of currently deployed sensors and system, without the need for IP network re-engineering. This is especially interesting for the net-centric mobile and tactical solutions for adding enhanced real-time sensing capabilities at the networkedge  The growing need for localized detection, identification processing, analysis and integration \(with modeling and inference engines of IDSS at the network edge  The data from the sensors can be simultaneously used at multiple stages. The IDSS based local solution is the local consumer of the Sensor information in order to trigger the local response. However even the local response could involve information-gathering from the regional \(or global  IDSS network platforms do not function as a historian or archival system, whereas the SWE infrastructure can be pushed the real-time information and then queried to fetch trends or patterns related information for better situational 


trends or patterns related information for better situational awareness  In general, any network centric Sensor Web Enablement solutions should be optimized to consider the IP networking best practices including the impact of NAT and Firewall in the tactical, remote, mobile and fixed network topologies. The SWE services in the centralized infrastructure need to function as IP Network  Server   and implement the smart sensors, actuators and systems as IP Network  Clients  Alternatively, the web-services should allow pull-based as well as push-based methods for every SOS components, to allow enough flexibility while designing &amp; implementing the IP networks  The following are some scenarios that can benefit from the IDSS enabled IP network-edge  80 3.2. Connected First-Responders  Firemen operate under extremely hostile environments including toxic smoke and high temperatures. This simplified example about the safety and monitoring of the firefighter operations extends the Local Area Networks LAN PAN devices become satellite nodes to the IDSS Network Platforms  First-Responders and Firemen that handle toxic materials wear a Level-A suite. It becomes important to monitor fatigue using sensors since these suites entirely cover the first responder. A PAN gateway can be used by the Firemen to connect various sensors and devices \(Sensor Pack Table 5 below  Table 5.  Example of a Sensor-Pack on Firemen    In the event of a massive event, the firefighters from neighboring counties may also join the firefighting mission, and bring their own sensor-packs. The IP addresses assigned to the sensor-packs deployed during the firefighting mission cannot be pre-assigned. Also given the urgency of the mission, the networking devices such as routers and firewalls can not be manually configured on site  The Common Operating Picture \(COP needs to periodically get data from the sensor-packs and also send commands as needed. The working solution is required to be dynamic and always connected to the local and central situational awareness tools  In an emergency solution the local applications attached to the IDSS network platforms can effectively monitor the sensors attached to the firemen while IDSS can also forward the information to the SWE components for global visibility into the emerging events  Complying with the IP network best-practices while designing the mobile and fixed solutions, will certainly result in network agnostic plug-n-play capability for sensor and systems integration. In addition to resolving the connectivity issues, IPv6 support is also becoming necessary for many solutions  Table 6.  Recommendations &amp; Best-Practices for IP Network Centric Collaboration 


Network Centric Collaboration    An analogy would be the hotel scenario where multiple hotel-guests bring their own laptops and connect over the hotel network. The hotel IP network-router assigns each of the laptops a unique private IP address using DHCP protocol, and all the guests are able to browse the internet Similarly the firemen from different counties should be able to come together and connect to their sensor packs to the centralized systems for real-time monitoring &amp response capabilities  4. IDSS SOLUTION DETAILS  IDSS is a small form-factor embedded-software solution It can be deployed for Infrastructure protection to facilitate local Sensing, Detection, Alerting and Notification services. A military base installation protection example shows the relevance of a local IDSS network platform to automate Standard Operating Procedures \(SOP Conditions \(FPCON   81 The five Force Protection Conditions are NORMAL ALPHA, BRAVO, CHARLIE, DELTA. IDSS can be tailored and configured to automate the qualification of the FPCON based on the real-time sensor conditions Following the FPCON identification, pre-defined actions can be triggers through the available and connected systems \(such as alerting, notification, reporting deploying-policies etc    Figure 4. Infrastructure protection scenario using IDSS Network platform  IDSS can be configured to continuously monitor the local sensors around the installation. Figure4 shows the network topology including the branch-router integrated with IDSS software for infrastructure protection. If the conditions such as Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear or Explosive \(CBRNE thresholds, it may cause FPCON upgrade. In parallel to monitoring the local sensors, IDSS can push the sensor information to approved SWE infrastructure. Global Common Operating Picture \(COP systems can be integrated through the SWE infrastructure IDSS can also control the local access-control systems activate local gates and barriers to block access to protect the infrastructure and safeguard the occupants  FPCON DELTA may trigger increased IP security including IP network policies that disconnect the network connecting the facility to the outside-networks \(extranets IDSS can be tailored to monitor network services to implement access-lists to block network access as required  Under certain events such as a large installation fire emergency, the firemen and ambulances from neighboring counties may need to be notified through OASIS CAP 1.1 or other standards based methods. Firemen need to coordinate the emergency response activities with the local response teams at the military installation. IDSS network platforms can serve as tactical &amp; mobile platforms to enable inter-agency interoperability  Some of the installations are not large and may not have local IT experts to maintain the data-center based 


local IT experts to maintain the data-center based solutions. In such scenarios a small form-factor IDSS can be a good fit for local sensor monitoring and response capability  5. IDSS FEATURES  IDSS is networked locally, leveraging the existing network infrastructure. Sensors are integrated into IDSS by implementing respective software drivers. Similarly the Systems and upstream integration using web-services are also integrated using the XML based services. Some of the features enabled by IDSS include  Table 6.  A Summary of IDSS Features    The strength of IDSS solution comes from its ability to package sensors and systems by enhancing an existing network infrastructure.  IDSS solutions are focused around enabling smart branch or remote IP network infrastructure. IDSS implementations are agnostic to the Command Center COP or other upstream applications  The examples of packaged IDSS kits include Carry-on Commanders-kit\(CK RRK Deployable Communication kit\(DCK First responders, Smart Branch Network Kits enabling energy-efficient smart buildings, Biometrics sensors integration kit, CBRNE Sensor Integration Kit, Medical 82 Response &amp; Telemedicine kit, Border Security \(RADAR Video Surveillance, Perimeter Security etc   Protection kit \(Chemical sensors, plume Modeling systems and COP industrial maintenance  6. SWE ARCHITECTURE COUPLING WITH IDSS  OGC SWE initiative is focused on developing standards to enable the discovery, exchange, and processing of sensor observations, as well as the tasking of sensor systems  SWE services can play an important role in enabling global situational awareness and inter-agency collaboration for effective response to a large and small scale events. The growth of SWE infrastructure would over-time enable significant data archival of current and past events and therefore aid the  data-mining  and  modeling  services to granularly predict the trends and correlation of global events. It has become increasingly important to have the ability to model, predict and respond to natural and man-made events, and SWE services could positively influence the decision making at central and global levels. The IDSS can be deployed to send and receive information from SWE components to feed the real-time data, information, and notification into the SWE architecture, while autonomously managing the local sensor interoperability. IDSS can serve as a proxy for the attached sensors and devices representing them as SWE Nodes for the centralized SWE architecture  Several COTS products and legacy sensors often do not comply with IEEE 1451.x [14] or the SWE standards Also majority of the COTS sensor products do not support IPv6 capabilities. Several of these sensors support RS232 based serial communications

However the users \(the consumers of sensor information analysis and modeling on multiple raw sensor inputs to derive actionable information such as trends, patterns growth of events, automated triggers, real-time response etc. A lot of the sensor information workflow can be locally performed without repeatedly representing all the raw-sensor information as web-services. Optimized solutions such as IDSS use derivers and low-level software solutions for enhanced performance and speed of local response  Databases and web-services can get stressed by real-time interaction with sensors.  Some next-generation Industrial sensors can read up to about 300-400 times per second Extensive use of web-services &amp; databases for highfrequency data exchange with a large number of fastsensors may require more CPU horse-power. Additionally the transactional delays of traditional database \(for example due to database indexing issues potentially slow down the end-to-end workflow  The more efficient hybrid approach is recommended where IDSS integrates the sensors using low-level software stacks. It then aggregates and translates the relevant information towards SWE architecture \(using web-services Figure6 below shows the high-level software stack that allows policy based integration with sensors, actuators and upstream SWE components through SWE services. The details of the specific implementation of each of the IDSS software modules are outside the scope of this paper    Figure 6. IDSS aggregates sensor information and integrates with the SWE Infrastructure  IDSS efficiently integrates legacy sensors and allows IPv6 network based systems to connect through the IP or traditional universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter 83 UART proprietary information into SWE standards compliant formats. IDSS can register the legacy sensors into SWE infrastructure. Regional and global OGC SWE components can also send commands to IDSS for sensor information requests  REFERENCES  1] Cisco White Paper on Service Oriented Network Architecture \(SONA http://www.cisco.com/en/US/solutions/collateral/ns340/ns629/s onaTOGAFwp072308.pdf  2] OASIS Emergency Management Standards Available: http://www.oasis-open.org  3] Modbus Protocol Available: http://www.modbus.org  4] NOAA leveraging OGC SWE Architecture implementation announcement

healthcare information systems, of which EMRs are a part, should provide researchers with new and diverse phenomena to be investigated.  We believe that this paper makes three contributions to EMR research First, we hope to improve understanding of EMR implementation by integrating findings from the ERP literature into EMR research. Second, we hope that by providing some theoretical background and propositions we can help EMR research move forward.  Third, we hope that collecting qualitative data provides some general support in the identification of success factors and a basis for developing more detailed empirical data collection  9.
