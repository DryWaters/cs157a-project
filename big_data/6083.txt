volume from heterogeneous sources is one true example of a Big Data An inher ent pr operty of any spatio-temporal dataset is uncertainty due to various sources of imprecision This tutorial provides a comprehensive overview of the different challenges involved in managing uncertain spatial and spatio-temporal data and presents state-of-the-art techniques for addressing them I I NTRODUCTION Current technology trends such as smart phones general mobile devices stationary sensors and satellites coupled with a new user mentality of utilizing this technology to vol 
untarily share information generate a huge volume of geospatial and geo-spatio-temporal data This data 003ood provides a tremendous potential of discovering new and possibly useful knowledge In addition to the fact that measurements are imprecise the physical limitation of devices also requires some form of interpolation in-between discrete time instants From a complementary perspective to reduce the communication and bandwidth utilization along with the storage requirements often the data is subjected to a reduction thereby eliminating some of the known/recorded values When it comes to Wireless Sensor Networks WSN in addition to the sheer 
imprecision of determining locations at a given time-instant uncertainty is also a consequence of 1 insuf\002cient coverage and 2 the quest for energy-savings All of these issues introduce the notion of uncertainty in the context of spatiotemporal data management an aspect raising an imminent need for its scalable and 003exible management The main objective of this tutorial is to present to the audience effective and ef\002cient solutions to various problems related to management of uncertain spatial and spatio-temporal data which have been published in the recent years In a plethora of research 002elds and industrial applications these 
techniques can substantially improve the quality of decision making minimize risk and unearth valuable insights that would otherwise remain hidden The challenge of effectiveness in uncertain data is to correctly determine the set of possible results each associated with the correct probability of being Fig 1 The Paradigm of Equivalent Worlds a result in order to give a user a con\002dence about the returned results The complementary challenge of ef\002ciency is to enable fast computations for these results and corresponding probabilities allowing for reasonable querying times even for 
large uncertain databases The general problem of querying uncertain spatial data using the common Possible-Worlds model is P-hard in the number of database objects Yet it has been observed that special query types and data mining tasks may still have a polynomial-time solution This tutorial identi\002es formalizes and applies a general paradigm to facilitate the challenge of 002nding such solutions As shown in Figure 1 in general it may be required to determine a PSPACE set of equivalent classes of possible worlds such that members of the same class can be considered equivalent for a given query predicate 
Many existing works on managing uncertain spatial data apply this paradigm for the most prominent classes of probabilistic spatial and spatio-temporal queries on uncertain data including range queries k-nearest neighbor queries ranking queries and reverse k-nearest neighbor queries Based on this concept novel spatial and probabilistic pruning approaches that have been developed recently will be discussed In the second part 978-1-4799-2555-1/14/$31.00 002 2014 IEEE ICDE Conference 2014 1302

technologies While the aforementioned techniques work well for single points of time the prediction of query results over time remains a challenge The main objectives of this tutorial are 017 Provide a comprehensive overview of different research issues and solutions addressing various aspects of uncertainty in spatial and spatio-temporal data This overview is aimed both at students with no prior experience in the 002eld as well as at attendants with some background 017 Present a comprehensive overview of models algorithms solutions and techniques in the 002eld of managing uncertain spatial data catering to a broad audience Here the aim is to teach the background necessary for attending sessions in the 002eld of uncertain data management increasing the attendance rate of such sessions at conferences such as ICDE 017 Teach common paradigms used to manage uncertainty including techniques for sampling and Monte-Carlo based approaches as well as a general paradigm for exact query processing using possible world semantics We are aware that several tutorials have been presented in the recent past 4 5 6 touching some of the topic s of this tutorial some of them by the proposers However what separates this proposed tutorial are a number of novelties 017 Many new topics are presented to the audience including a tutorial on managing uncertain spatio-temporal data 017 Its unique presentation style 226 each expert will get a chance to inform the audience not only about the topics he deems relevant but also in a manner that he perceives the main bene\002ts of those topics and how he used them in his own research 017 It will balance the breadth and the depth between bodies of works which in many dimensions are inter-related but have not been presented in a 224uni\002ed\224 tutorial II T UTORIAL O UTLINE We now outline the main themes addressed in the tutorial Motivation Application Settings Living in a world of data-driven science we will begin the tutorial by introducing spatial and spatio-temporal data as well as modern sources of such data such as GeoWeb 2.0 and GeoSocial data Dr Trajcevski will begin the tutorial by motivating the importance of managing and analyzing such data giving spatial applications such as sensor monitoring locationbased services as well as spatio-temporal applications including RFID tracking GPS tracking 10 The importance of analyzing data that arises in such applications is set into the context of the vision of analyzing big data Fig 2 Components of a Probabilistic Spatial Query Spatial and Spatiotemporal Data Dr Trajcevski will formally introduce spatial and spatiotemporal data and give an overview over existing work that has been done on managing such data ignoring uncertainty Given that techniques for spatial data are rather well-known by the community we present these brie\003y and will focus on representation management and query processing of spatiotemporal data 12 13 14 Models for Uncertain Spatial Data A formal categorization of models for uncertain spatial data will be provided by Dr Emrich He we will introduce discrete 16 and continuous 18 19 models attrib ute 20 21 22  24 and e xistential 25 uncertainty probabilistic query predicates such as probabilistic threshold queries 26  return all objects ha ving a result probability greater some threshold and probabilistic topk queries return the kset of objects having the highest result probability as well as approximate queries He will also introduce the notion of probabilistic query answer semantics including object based semantics 26 30 that return objects assoc iated with probabilities to be part of the result of a query as well as result-based semantics that return result sets associated with probabilities to be the result of a query The whole spectrum of components of a probabilistic query is shown in Figure 2 Furthermore indexing techniques 27 33  34 for uncertain spatial data will be presented Possible World Semantics Dr Z 250 u\003e will introduce the concept of possible world semantics giving a mathematically sound and intuitive interpretation of uncertain spatial databases that is commonly used To tame the exponentially large number of possible worlds  35 36 37 spanning an uncertain spatial database two main approaches will be described in detail These are Monte-Carlo approaches and the P aradigm of Equi v alent Worlds Dr Z 250 u\003e will describe the later yet unpublished paradigm depicted in Figure 1 This solution is implicitly used by all approaches answering queries in polynomial time using possible world semantics e.g to f acilitate the search for ef\002cient algorithms 1303 Spatial\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002 Query\002Predicate Probabilistic\002 Spatial\002Query 


Spatial Query Processing on Uncertain Spatial Data Dr Z 250 u\003e will show how both approaches Monte-Carlo sampling and the Paradigm of Possible Worlds are used to answer a wide range of queries on uncertain spatial data having discrete uncertainty models Speci\002cally he will show solutions for kNN queries 27 39 Here we will present a selection of elegant techniques that have recently been published including the Poisson-Binomial recurrence technique and the generating functions technique Furthermore stateof-the-art techniques used to manage probabilistic streams  41 28 42 i.e uncertain spatial objects that change their distribution frequently will be discussed Dr Z 250 u\003e will proceed to present solutions for the case of objects having continuous models He will show advanced solutions for the problem of reverse k-nearest neighbor search 44 26 For this purpose he will present techniques to approximate continuous density functions using polynomial splines and using a hierarchical partitioning scheme Based on this approximations Dr Z 250 u\003e will show how to approximate the kNN probability of an object Here special emphasis will be given to stochastic distance correlation i.e that even if three objects A  B and C are mutually independent the distances dist  A C  and dist  B C  may be correlated as both these random variables depend on the common random variable C  Using the technique of uncertain generating functions 45 a correct ef fecti v e and ef 002cient solution to approximate kNNs will be presented Traditional Approaches for Uncertain Spatio-Temporal Data With the integration of temporal aspects the problem of handling uncertainty becomes even more challenging Dr Trajcevski will review traditional models to cope with these new challenges by bounding the possible locations of objects over time by spatio-temporal cylinders 47 48 diamonds  or beads 50 51 On top of these models se v eral query types have been proposed such as range queries  48 and kNN queries 46 53 Additionally  Goce will emphasise the problem of location dependency in older works on this topic 46 49 54 55 in order to moti v ate the use of more advanced models State-of-the-art approaches for querying traf\002c network data will also be discussed Advanced Approaches for Uncertain Spatio-Temporal Data Dr Emrich will present recently developed models for uncertain spatio-temporal data where objects are described stochastic processes As a characteristic type of a stochastic process the Markov model is introduced and its application to UST data is shown in Furthermore he will sho w ho w window queries similarity queries 56 and kNN queries  can be solv ed using both proposed solution approaches equivalent worlds vs monte-carlo sampling Finally index structures for this model will be presented The tutorial concludes with an overview of open research challenges and future work III P RESENTER B IOS Tobias Emrich received a diploma in Computer

Here in this paper we have repeated our experiment five times but the results came similar after three iteration .Also we will observe the change in the results because as discussed in our proposed architecture, after every anomaly identified by the anomaly detection engine and not found in both databases i.e Known anomaly and Signiture database, then it will add a new rule to Signiture database and next time it will be directly detected as intrusion. We will show the enhancement as under TABLE VI: DETECTION RATE  iteration 2 One-stop Series1 Type Percentage of False Alarm

In this paper, we have proposed a new hybrid model which combines both the modules i.e anomaly and signature based also we have added few more modules which will check for false alarm and will add new rules to the signature database automatically thus we can say, it is a model which will detects novel intrusion made on the system and is reducing the number of false alarm. In future, we will try to implement the model for intrusion preventions also. We will also try to build the model using machine learning also

Size of Largeincrease The reasons are twofold Firstly when increases according to the node selection scheme to construct decrease There are two reasons Firstly when the memory size increases the stop condition for graph contraction is easier to be satis\336ed since more nodes can 336t in memory Secondly when the memory size increases the costs of the external sorts in both graph contraction and graph expansion phases decrease  Average Degree Number of Largeincreases the time and I/O consumptions for both increases the number of iterations in graph contraction increases This is because when number of edges increases the cost to sort and scan edges in each iteration increases thus more time and I/Os are consumed in each iteration                                     2 4 1 u E  V v E    u v

are 336xed This also explains why the results in the three datasets Massiveis a primitive operation in directed graph exploration which has been studied for both internal memory model and external memory model In the internal memory model strongly connected components of a directed graph can be computed in s for a directed graph with the assumption that the nodes of the graph cannot reside entirely in memory We overcome the de\336ciencies of the existing external    sort sort computation algorithms and propose a new two-phase algorithm with graph contraction followed by graph expansion We analyze the I/O cost of our approach and show that our algorithm can signi\336cantly reduce the number of random I/Os We propose techniques to further reduce the I/O cost of our algorithm and con\336rm the I/O ef\336ciency of our approaches using extensive experiments on both real and synthetic web scale graphs The work was supported by grant of the Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong
