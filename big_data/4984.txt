Introduction to Association Mining Introduction to Association Mining Association rule mining is a data mining application to extract patterns Reveals interesting relationships called associations in a potentially large database Example Supermarket checkout information about customer purchases used to measure customer purchasing behavior customer purchasing behavior  Evaluation of this information can help retailers devise more efficient and personalized marketing strategies Association Rule Example Milk Beer  Diapers Find all the rules X Y with minimum support and confidence Support  s probability that a transaction contains X and Y Confidence  c conditional probability that a transaction Associative IDS for NextGen Frameworks Dr S Dua LA Tech 16 Image Source budlight.com pampers.com 


Associations as Higher Order Associations as Higher Order Features Hypothesis Associative relationships among features have more discriminatory power than individual/raw features Goal Use these associative relationships for supervised learning classification  Specific Aims Represent associative relationships as features  higher order features Challenges Challenges Not as straightforward as regular classification Rules to higher order feature transformation Rules to higher order feature transformation Associative IDS for NextGen Frameworks Dr S Dua LA Tech 17
