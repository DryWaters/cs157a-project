ljpang@mail.xidian.edu.cn Liwei He Qingqi Pei Yumin Wang State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks Xidian University Xi'an 710071 China Abstract 227As low-cost tags based on the EPC C-1 G-2 standard are much limited in storage capacity and computation power most of the existing authentication protocols are too complicated to be suitable for these tags and the design of authentication protocols conforming to the EPC C-1 G-2 standard is a big challenge Recently a mutual authentication protocol for RFID conforming to the EPC C-1 G-2 standard was proposed by Yeh et al and it is claimed that this protocol has solved all security vulnerabilities in the existing RFID protocols However in fact it is proven that this scheme is vulnerable to the tag tracing attack and suffers from the information leakage issue and the complexity of the successful attack is only 2 16  To address these issues ef\002ciently a novel secure RFID authentication protocol conforming to the EPC C-1 G-2 standard is proposed In the new scheme the attack complexity is raised to 2 32 without changing the length of any protocol data Analysis shows that our protocol can not only ef\002ciently resist the tag information leakage and the tag tracing attack but also have a signi\002cant advantage in performance over Yeh et al s protocol Keywords 227 RFID EPC C-1 G-2 standard privacy security I I NTRODUCTION Nowadays with the development of logistics and ecommerce the Radio Frequency Identi\002cation 050RFID\051 technology has been employed in many applications such as public transportation pass supply chain management e-passport access control system and etc The RFID technology is a passive automatic identi\002cation technology that uses radio signals to automatically identify the target and obtain its relevant data without human intervention and can work in all kinds of harsh environments In an RFID system the reader communicates wirelessly with a RFID tag via radio frequency signals which makes the RFID system vulnerable to the tag impersonation attack the tracing attack the replay attack the DoS 050denial of service\051 attack the eavesdropping attack and so on So the security problem has become an obstacle to using the RFID technology widely To heal these security weaknesses existing in the RFID system many researchers have paid more attention to the RFID authentication protocols based on cryptographic mechanisms in the early research of the RFID security mechanism Nevertheless due to the storage and computation limitation of the low-cost tags it is not realistic to design a protocol based on complicated cryptographic algorithms At present it is commonly accepted to use the Hash function whose computation overhead is relatively small to authenticate tags and the reader in low-cost RFID security authentication schemes 2 Ho we v er  the EPC Class-1 Generation-2 050short as EPC C-1 G-2\051 standard which is suitable for low-cost RFID tags and proposed by EPC 050Electronic Product Code\051 global organization de\002nes a much stricter frame w ork including the tags functions and operations In the EPC C1 G-2 standard the allowable operations of tags are restricted to some simple operations such as CRC 050Cycle Redundancy checksum Code\051 PRNG 050Pseudo Random Number Generator\051 and bitwise XOR and even the Hash operation is not available under this de\002nition 5 In this case those RFID authentication protocols based on the Hash function are too complicated for EPC C-1 G-2 tags Therefore the design of RFID authentication protocols conforming to the EPC C-1 G-2 standard becomes one of hot topics of the RFID security protocol Most of the existing RFID authentication protocols conforming to the EPC C-1 G-2 standard have undergone some dif\002culties to provide the security It usually introduces new problems when trying to solve some potential ones Juels proposed an anti-cloning and anti-counterfeiting RFID authentication protocol conforming to the EPC C-1 G-2 standard in 2005 However Duc et al  pointed out that there are some weaknesses related to privacy and information leakage in Juels scheme And at the same time Duc et al  proposed a new scheme which only used CRC XOR and PRNG to guarantee the interactive information security and declared it can achieve mutual authentication between the tag and the reader as well as the synchronous updating of secret key But later researchers found that Duc et al s protocol is prone to the de-synchronization attack and it cannot ensure the forward security Chien and Chen 8 proposed an impro v ed RFID authentication protocol 050referred as CC\051 in 2007 But soon after that Lopez et al  pointed out that the CC scheme cannot resist the tag and reader impersonation tracing and de-synchronization attacks Han and Kwon also sho wed clearly in another way that the above attacks of the CC scheme results mainly from the linear attributes of CRC In 2010 Yeh et al  proposed a secure RFID mutual authentication protocol 050referred as SRP\051 The SRP scheme uses the tag index number to search the target tag from the database and it improves the ef\002ciency of the database to identify tags However Habbie et al  17 found its dra wbacks

may leak the secret key and an adversary can easily get the shared secret key via a simple passive attack In addition the SRP protocol does not accord with the common assumptions of the RFID authentication protocol and the authentication operations between the reader and the backend server are not necessary because they are usually wired connected and the communication between them is assumed to be secure 5 8 12 13 Motivated by these concerns a new RFID authentication protocol conforming to the EPC C-1 G-2 standard is proposed The rest of the paper is organized as follows In Section 2 the authentication process of the SRP protocol is introduced and some analyses are made on them Then our RFID authentication protocol conforming to the EPC C-1 G-2 standard is proposed in Section 3 In Section 4 the security and privacy of our protocol is analyzed with given security models Finally we put forward the related conclusions in Section 5 II V ULNERABILITIES OF THE SRP PROTOCOL A Review of the SRP protocol The notations used in the SRP protocol are introduced in Table I and the process of the SRP protocol is simply described as follows 1\051 Initialization For each tag the database is preloaded with the entry  K old  P old  C old  K new  P new  C new EPC s RID D i  The v alues K 0  P 0 and C 0 are generated randomly by the manufacturer And initially we set K old  K new  K 0  P old  P new  P 0  C old  C new  C 0  Each tag records the entry  K i  K 0  P i  P 0  C i  C 0  EPC s  which ha v e the same v alues as those recorded in database 2\051 T he 050 i  1\051 th authentication round First the reader queried the tag T with a random number N R  Then the tag T responds to the reader's query by computing M 1  PRNG\050EPC s 010 N R 051 010 K i D  N T 010 K i E  N T 010 PRNG 050 C i 010 K i 051 and sending M 1  D  E and C to the reader Then the reader transmits M 1  D  E and C to the server The server computes M 2 PRNG\050EPC s 010 N T 051 010 P X 050where X new or old\051 and Info D i 010 RID and sends them to the reader after successfully authenticating the tag and at the same time updates K i  P i and C i as follows If X new it updates the stored values as follows K old  K new  K new  PRNG 050 K new 051 P old  P new  P new  PRNG 050 P new 051 C old  C new  C new  PRNG 050 N T 010 N R 051 If X old it only updates C i as C new  PRNG\050 N T 010 N R 051 At last the reader transmits M 2 to the tag After authenticating the server successfully the tag updates K i  P i and C i as follows K i 1  PRNG 050 K i 051 P i 1  PRNG 050 P i 051 C i 1  PRNG 050 N T 010 N R 051 B Vulnerabilities of the SRP protocol Habibi et al  sho ws that the SRP protocol does not provide the forward security 050or called the backward untraceability\051 and the untraceability Aside from the tracing attacks it is presented that an adversary can obtain the most important secret information value called EPC s by impersonating the reader to perform two consecutive sessions with the target tag Upon having got the correct EPC s  the adversary can 002gure out the shared secret value of K i and successfully impersonate the tag for ever In addition the reveal of EPC s can lead to the DoS attack and the Server Forgery attack 050see 16  for details\051 In addition to the above attacks proposed by Habibi et al  we present a simple passive attack which also can break the SRP protocol and this attack makes it possible for an adversary to get the K i  Here we will present this attack In the SRP protocol it is mentioned that the value EPC s is a 16-bit string which is constructed from XORing six 16-bit blocks of the EPC code Since N R and N T are XORed with EPC s  it is concluded that the bit lengths of N R and N T are the same as the bit length of EPC s which is 16 Since K i  P i and C i are updated by PRNG the bit lengths of them must be equal to the output length of PRNG which is 16 The process of the simple attack is shown as follows 1\051 The adversary intercepts the responding message 050 C i  M 1  D E 051 of the tag in the i th session and the structure of the messages D and E are as follows D  N T 010 K i

E  N T 010 PRNG 050 C i 010 K i 051 2\051 The adversary omits N T by XORing D and E  D 010 E  N T 010 K i 010 N T 010 PRNG 050 C i 010 K i 051  K i 010 PRNG 050 C i 010 K i 051  014 where 014 is a 16-bit string equal to D 010 E in value 3\051 Let L  f l 1  l 2   l 16 g be the set of all bit strings with length 16 Since K i is a bit string with length 16 we have K i 2 L  With 014 and C i  the adversary continues the below algorithm a 051 Choose l i 2 L  for 1 024 i 024 2 16  b 051 Compute 013  l i 010 PRNG\050 C i 010 l i 051 c 051 If 013  014  then return l i as K i  After at most 2 16 executions of the algorithm the adversary can 002nd the correct K i  As a result it is easy to see that the SRP protocol cannot resist the tag information leakage and the tracing attack In addition we can see the attack complexity of our method is equal to that of Habibi et al s i.e 2 16  III T HE PROPOSED PROTOCOL The SRP protocol is not suitable for practical applications because it does not accord with the common assumptions of the RFID authentication protocol Thus here the common assumptions of RFID authentication protocol are introduced 002rst and then the RFID privacy model is given in this section And at last the proposed protocol is described in details A Common Assumptions Our protocol works under the following assumptions  8 12 13 1\051 Each tag has a unique initiator 050for example the manufacturer\051 which creates and maintains security parameters for the tag 2\051 Each tag and the reader have a PRNG function The tag can generate random numbers and perform the CRC operation and their memories are assumed to be secure 3\051 The channel between the server and the reader is secure This assumption is reasonable because unlike the tag the reader's performance is unlimited and thus it can set up a secure channel with the server by using those known security protocols which have been proved secure 050or directly using wired connection\051 So the algorithm used by them is not restricted to the equipments performance and the use of the complicated and secure cryptographic algorithms can raise the system security largely as a result After all the simple algorithm and the protocol's security are relative to the cost of the equipments when designing some security protocols related to tags 4\051 The reader and the tag communicate over an insecure channel and the communication between them is subject to eavesdropping or modi\002cation B Privacy Model The privacy model 14 15 17 18 19 is described as follows The protocol parties are composed of tags 050 T 051 and readers 050 R 051 which interact each other in each protocol session In this model an adversary A controls the communication channel between all parties either passively or actively The Adversary A is allowed to run the following queries 1\051 Execute\050 R T i 051 query This query models the passive attacks The adversary A eavesdrops over the communication channel between T and R and gets the read access to the exchanged messages between them in session i of a truthful protocol execution 2\051 Send\050 U V m i 051 query This query models active attacks by allowing the adversary A to impersonate some readers U 2 R 050respectively V 2 T 051 in some session i and send a message m to some tag V 2 T 050respectively reader U 2 R 051 Furthermore the adversary A is allowed to block or alert the message m  3\051 Corrupt\050 T K 0 051 query This query allows the adversary A to learn the stored secret K of the tag T  and which further sets the stored secret to K 0  Corrupt query means that the adversary A has physical access to the tag i.e the adversary can tamper with the tag's permanent memory 4\051 Test\050 i T 0  T 1 051 query This query does not correspond to any of the A s capabilities but it is necessary to de\002ne the untraceable test When this query is invoked for session i  a random number b 2 f 0  1 g is generated and then A is given T b 2 f T 0  T 1 g  Informally A wins if he can guess the bit b correctly Untraceable privacy 050UPriv\051 is de\002ned by using the game g played between an adversary A and a collection of session instances between the reader and the tag The game g is divided into three following phases Phase 1 050Learning\051  A is given T 0 or T 1 randomly and A is able to send any Execute Send and Corrupt queries at will to T 0  T 1 and readers Phase 2 050Challenge\051  1 At some point during g  A chooses two fresh tags T 0 and T 1 to be tested and sends a Test\050 i T 0  T 1 051 query Depending on a randomly chosen bit b 2 f 0  1 g  A is given a tag T b 2 f T 0  T 1 g  2 A continues making any Execute Send and Corrupt queries at will Phase 3 050Guess\051  Eventually A terminates the game g simulations and outputs a bit b 0 2 f 0  1 g  which is the guess value of b  The success of A in winning the game g and thus breaking the notion of UPriv is quanti\002ed in terms of A s advantage in determining what A receives is T 0 or T 1  The advantage is denoted by Adv U priv A 050 k 051  Adv U priv A 050 k 051  j P r 050 b 0  b 051 000 1  2 j  where k is the security parameter De\002nition 1 A protocol is secure if the advantage Adv U priv A 050 k 051 of the adversary is negligible C Description of the proposed protocol The notations used in the proposed protocol are the same as the SRP protocol 050in Table I\051 Based on the common assumptions presented in Section III-A a new RFID authentication protocol conforming to the EPC C-1 G-2 standard is proposed to solve the security problems existing in the SRP protocol

A computes EPC T 0 s 010 N T b 1 i 000 1 010 M T b 1 i 000 1  022 where 022 is a 16-bit string Theorem 1 During the above game g  if A cannot derive the value of 022 from the tag's responding messages i.e A cannot judge what he received is T 0 or T 1  that is A is unable to determine the value of b 0  Thus the A s advantage Adv U P riv A 050 k 051 is negligible Proof By the fact that EPC s is a permanent value in the all rounds of the protocol we have EPC T 0 s;i EPC T 0 s;i 000 1  By performing the 002rst two steps 050Learning and Challenge\051 the adversary A obtains the above messages including the tag's responding message in the round 050 i 051 M T b 1 i 000 1  EPC s 010 N T b 1 i 000 1 010 K T b i 000 1 CN T b 2 i 000 1  N T b 2 i 000 1 010 PRNG 050 K T b i 000 1 051 M T b 2 i 000 1  CRC\050EPC s 010 N T b 2 i 000 1 010 C T b i 000 1 051 010 K T b i 000 1 The adversary A computes EPC T 0 s 010 N T b 1 i 000 1 010 M T b 1 i 000 1  022  From the structure of the tag's responding message above we can see it is infeasible to derive the secret key K T b i 000 1 without the temporary privacy key N T b 2 i 000 1  although we know M T b 1 i 000 1  CN T b 2 i 000 1 and M T b 2 i 000 1  Therefore the adversary A couldn't distinguish T 0 from T 1  i.e A can not determine the value of b 0  So the advantage Adv U P riv A 050 k 051 is negligible i.e our protocol guarantees the forward security 2\051 P rivacy of tags In our protocol to trace the target tag an adversary can perform the following steps Phase 1 050Learning\051  The adversary A sends an Execute 050 R T 0  i  1 051 query in the round 050 i  1 051 and thus obtain 050 C T 0 i  M T 0 1 i  CN T 0 2 i  M T 0 2 i 051 Phase 2 050Challenge\051  The adversary A chooses two fresh tags T 0 and T 1 to be tested and sends a Test 050 i  1  T 0  T 1 051 query Depending on a randomly chosen bit b 2 f 0  1 g  A is given a tag T b 2 f T 0  T 1 g  A makes an Execute 050 R T b  i  1 051 query in the round 050 i  1 051 and as a result A is given messages 050 C T b i  M T b 1 i  CN T b 2 i  M T b 2 i 051 Phase 3 050Guess\051  Finally A terminates the game g and outputs a bit b 0 2 f 0  1 g as its guess of the value of b  Theorem 2 During the above game g  if A cannot make sure whether the obtained messages come from the same tag i.e A cannot distinguish T 0 from T 1  that is A is unable to determine the value of b 0  Then A s advantage Adv U P riv A 050 k 051 is negligible Proof The responding messages obtained by the adversary A in Phase 1 are as follows M T 0 1 i  EPC T 0 s 010 N 1 010 K T 0 i CN T 0 2 i  N T 0 2 i 010 PRNG 050 K T 0 i 051 M T 0 2 i  CRC\050EPC T 0 s 010 N T 0 2 i 010 C T 0 i 051 010 K T 0 i And the received messages in Phase 2 are as follows M T b 1 i  EPC T b s 010 N 1 010 K T b i CN T b 2 i  N T b 2 i 010 PRNG 050 K T b i 051 M T b 2 i  CRC\050EPC T b s 010 N T b 2 i 010 C T b i 051 010 K T b i From the structures of these messages we can see The query message N 1  which will be used in the expression of M 1  is chosen randomly and in addition the message M 1 is relative to the secret key K i  where K i  K i 000 1 010 050 N 2 035 l 2\051  So the message M 1 varies dynamically each session because of N 1 although the shared secret key K i is not updated In addition the random number N 2  which then is used in the expressions of CN 2 and M 2  is chosen randomly by the tag So it is absolutely possible to guarantee that the value of CN 2 is different in each session as well as M 2  Therefore the adversary A couldn't distinguish T 0 from T 1  i.e A doesn't determine the value of b 0  and the advantage Adv U P riv A 050 k 051 is negligible So our protocol achieves the untraceability B Performance Analysis From the structure of the protocol messages we can see that the complexity of deriving EPC s and K i from the message 050 N 1  M 1 051 is 2 32  where M 1  EPC s 010 N 1 010 K i  The complexity of deriving EPC s and K i from the message M 2 is 2 48 where M 2  CRC\050EPC s 010 N 2 010 C i 051 010 K i and N 2 is secure In addition since the M 1 and M 2 are independent of each other the adversary needs at least 2 32 executions of the exhaustive search operations to derive EPC s and K i  Compared with the complexity of the SRP protocol 2 16  our protocol is effective to resist the exhaustive search attack TABLE II S TORAGE REQUIREMENTS   Storage

 7 5  S UMMARY  The purpose of this paper was to introduce a modifi ed VCM system design for near and deep space communication s Software simulation of this design was performed to  determine throughput improvements and verify the feasibility of the whole design  Problems with fra me descriptor identification were resolved by unique l ength VCM modes and inferring the VCM mode though frame marker spacing.  The simulation looked at an exampl e of a varying communications link polar orbiting CubeSat s Simulation showed that the proposed VCM system roug hly doubles throughput and slightly outperforms similar  VCM codes like SCCC and DVBS2  Future work for the proposed VCM system includes eliminating the frame descriptor from transmission developing an optimal  mode selection algorithm, and developing the proposed sy stem in hardware specifically for CubeSat application A CKNOWLEDGMENTS  The research was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology und er a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the University of Alaska Fairban ks College of Engineering and Mines funded in part by  the Alaska Space Grant Program R EFERENCES  1  J   C u t t l e r  a n d  J   M a n n    G l o b a l  G r o u n d  S t a t i o n  Survey 5 th  Annual CubeSat Developers Workshop  August 2008 http://gs.engin.umich.edu/documents/Mann_etal_2008 pd f 2  M   C a f f r e y    E x p l o i t i n g  L i n k  D y n a m i c s  i n  L E O t o Ground Communications 6 th  Annual CubeSat Developers Workshop  San Luis Obispo CA 2009 http://www.cubesat.org/images/cubesat/presentations Dev elopersWorkshop2009/4_Comm/2_CaffreyLink_Dynamics.pdf 3  F l e x i b l e  A d v a n c e d  C o d i n g  a n d  M o d u l a t i o n  S c h e m e  for High Rate Telemetry Applications CCSDS 131.2-B-1 Blue Book Issue 1 March 2012 http://public.ccsds.org/publications/archive/131x2b 1.pdf 4  T M  S y n c h r o n i z a t i o n  a n d  C h a n n e l  C o d i n g    C C S D S  131.0-B-2  Blue Book Issue 2 August 2011 http://public.ccsds.org/publications/archive/131x0b 2ec1.p df 5  J   H a m k i n s    P e r f o r m a n c e  o f  l o w d e n s i t y  p a r i t y check coded modulation Aerospace Conference 2010 IEEE  vol., no., pp.1-14, 6-13 March 2010 6  S   O l i v i e r i    M o d u l a r  F P G A B a s e d  S o f t w a r e  D e f i n ed Radio for CubeSats Worcester Polytechnic Institut e May 2011  7  D i g i t a l  V i d e o  B r o a d c a s t i n g   D V B    S e c o n d  g e n e r ation framing structure, channel coding and modulation sy stems for Broadcasting Interactive Services News Gather ing and other broadband satellite applications ETSI EN  302 307, v1.1.2,2006 B IOGRAPHIES   Thomas A Sielicki  received a B.S degree in electrical engineering from the University of Virginia in 2010.
