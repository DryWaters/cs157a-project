which can seriously limit the data-access performance Collective I/O has been widely used to address this issue However the performance of collective I/O could be dramatically degraded in todayês high-performance computing system due to the increasing shufîe cost caused by highly concurrent data accesses This situation tends to be even worse as many applications become more and more data intensive Previous research has primarily focused on optimizing I/O access cost in collective I/O but largely ignored the shufîe cost involved In this study we propose a new hierarchical I/O scheduling HIO algorithm to address the increasing shufîe cost in collective I/O The fundamental idea is to schedule applications I/O requests 
based on a shufîe cost analysis to achieve the optimal overall performance instead of achieving optimal I/O accesses only The algorithm is currently evaluated with the MPICH2 and PVFS2 Both theoretical analysis and experimental tests show that the proposed hierarchical I/O scheduling has a potential in addressing the degraded performance issue of collective I/O with highly concurrent accesses Keywords collective I/O scheduling high-performance computing big data data intensive computing I I NTRODUCTION The volume of data collected from instruments and simulations for scientiìc discovery and innovations keeps 
increasing rapidly For example the Global Cloud Resolving Model GCRM project part of DOE s Scientiìc Discovery through Advanced Computing SciDAC program is built on a geodesic grid that consists of more than 100 million hexagonal columns with 128 levels per column These 128 levels will cover a layer of 50 kilometers of atmosphere up from the surface of the earth For each of these grid cells scientists need to store analyze and predict parameters like the wind speed temperature pressure etc Most of these global atmospheric models process data in a 100-kilometer scale the distance on the ground however scientists desire higher resolution and ner granularity which can lead to signiìcant larger sizes of datasets The 
data volume processed online by many applications has exceeded TBs or even tens of TBs the off-line data is near PBs of scale During the retrieval and analysis of the large volume of datasets on high-performance computing HPC systems scientiìc applications generate huge amounts of noncontiguous requests 18 e.g accessing the 2-D planes in a 4-D climate dataset Those non-contiguous requests can be considerably optimized by performing a two-phase collective I/O Ho we v er  the performance of the collective I/O could be dramatically degraded when solving big data problems on a highly-concurrent HPC system 7 A critical reason is that the increasing shufîe cost of 
collective requests can dominate the performance This increasing shufîe cost is due to the high concurrency caused by intensive data movement and concurrent applications in todayês HPC system The shufîe phase is the second phase of a two-phase collective I/O A collective I/O will not nish until the shufîe phase is done Previous research has primarily focused on the optimization of the other phase the I/O phase of a collective I/O for data-intensive applications In this study instead of only considering the service time during the I/O phase we argue that a better scheduling algorithm in collective I/O should also consider the requests shufîe costs on compute nodes An aggregator who has the 
longest shufîe time can dominate an applicationês overall performance In this research we propose a new hierarchical I/O HIO scheduling to address this issue The basic idea is by saturating the aggregators acceptable delay the algorithm schedules each applicationês slowest aggregator earlier The proposed algorithm is named as hierarchical I/O scheduling because the predicted shufîe cost is considered at the MPI-IO layer on compute nodes and the server-side le system layer Both layers leverage the shufîe cost analysis to perform an improved scheduling for collective I/O The current analyses and experimental tests have conìrmed 
the improvements over existing approaches The proposed hierarchical I/O scheduling has a potential in addressing the degraded performance issue of collective I/O with highly concurrent accesses The contribution of this research is three-fold First we propose an idea of scheduling collective I/O requests with considering the shufîe cost Second we have derived functions to calculate and predict the shufîe cost Third we have carried out theoretical analyses and experimental tests to verify the efìciency of the proposed hierarchical I/O HIO scheduling The results have conìrmed that the

HIO approach is promising in improving data accesses for high-performance computing The rest of this paper is organized as follows Section II reviews collective I/O and motivates this study by analyzing a typical example of interrupted collective read Section III introduces the HIO scheduling algorithm Section IV presents the theoretical analysis of the HIO scheduling Section V discusses the implementation The experimental results are discussed in Section VI Section VII discusses related work and compares them with this study Section VIII summarizes this study and discusses future work II M OTIVATION Collective I/O plays a critical role in cooperating processes to generate aggregated I/O requests instead of performing non-contiguous small I/Os independently A widely-used implementation of collective I/O is the twophase I/O protocol For collective reads in the rst phase a certain number of processes are assigned as aggregators to access large contiguous data in the second phase those aggregators shufîe the data among all processes to the desired destination There is no synchronization during the shufîe phase which means as long as one aggregator gets its data it will redistribute the data among processes immediately without waiting for other aggregators Aggregated requests p 0  0 1 3 1 3 2 3 1 2 3 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 Aggregators p x  p x  p 0  p x  p x  p 4  p x  p x  t node 0 node 2  node 1  p 2  p 4  0 p 2  Figure 1 Interrupted Collective Read p x is from other applications An observation is that on todayês HPC system with highly concurrent accesses the service order of the aggregators on storage nodes can have an impact on the applicationês overall performance The example in Fig 1 shows a two-phase collective read operation which is interrupted by processes from other concurrent applications due to highly concurrent accesses In Fig 1 ve processes p 0 p 4  on the same compute node for simplicity from one MPI application are accessing the data striped across three storage nodes During the rst phase the I/O aggregators p 0 p 2 and p 4  are assigned with evenly partitioned le domains In this case we can predict that only two aggregators i.e p 0 and p 2  will have to redistribute the data among other processes i.e p 1 and p 3  in the shufîe phase The reason why p 4 does not need to participate in the shufîe phase is that p 4 s requests are only accessed by p 4 itself From Fig 1 we can also nd that the service order of each aggregator is different on the storage nodes which means three aggregators of the same application are not serviced at the same time For example assuming other processes have the same service time then a possible service order for these three I/O aggregators is p 4  p 0 and p 2  Such a service order can have variants and can have an impact We compare two of them in Fig 2 Read Read Shuf Read Shuf 24t a 4 p 0 p 2   18t 12t 6t p 4  p 0  p 2  Read Read Shuf Read Shuf  18t 12t 6t b 0 p 2 p 4  p 0  p 2  p 4  Figure 2 Two Different Service Orders In Fig 2 we analyze the cost for two different service orders We assume that the service time and the shufîe cost is equal for the same amount of data movement and each process has service time 6 t  while the total execution time is calculated as the sum of the read cost and the shufîe cost In Fig 2\(a the aggregator p 4 is serviced rst After 6 t p 0 receives the service and then p 2  During the shufîe phase only p 0 and p 2 need to redistribute the data with other processes Therefore this applicationês total execution time is 3  6 t 6 t 24 t  In Fig 2\(b p 0 is serviced rst We nd that the total execution time is reduced to 18t The performance gain comes from scheduling the slowest aggregator rst The slowest aggregator in this study refers the aggregator who takes the longest time to redistribute the data in the shufîe phase Another observation from Fig 2\(b is that the service order of p 4 will not have impact on the total cost which means even if p 4 comes rst on node2 in some case we can still service it later In other words we can delay p 4 at most 12 t  this delay time is acceptable no performance degradation will be caused This example only shows that scheduling aggregators properly can improve the performance for one application whereas for multiple concurrent applications how to achieve the average lowest total time is a challenge Besides the shufîe cost of different aggregators varies How to predict the shufîe cost and pass it to the server is a challenge too In the following sections we introduce a hierarchical I/O scheduling HIO algorithm to address these issues III H IERARCHICAL I/O S CHEDULING From the previous analysis we can see that by scheduling slower aggregators earlier the total execution time access cost and shufîe cost can be reduced In the case of with concurrent applications however the goal of the optimal 
212 


scheduling should be achieving the lowest average total execution time From the observation in Fig 2\(b we know that applicationês aggregators may have acceptable delay time If such time is well utilized to service other applications we can potentially achieve a win-win situation In the following subsections we rst discuss how to predict the shufîe cost and then formally introduce the concept of acceptable delay Then we present the proposed hierarchical I/O scheduling algorithm A Analysis and Prediction of Shufîe Cost In order to analyze the shufîe cost we need to know how aggregators are assigned and how they will communicate with other desired processes Most previous works assumed that only one aggregator is assigned in one node which is also a default conìguration in MPICH The communication cost thus includes inter-node and intra-node cost as shown in Fig 3 The amount of data redistributed impacts the cost too Therefore the shufîe costs are mainly determined by exchanging data and the number and position of desired processes Aggregator Process node 0  node 2  node 1  Figure 3 Example of Process Assignment in Three Node Multi-core System The arrows show the inter and intra communication in the shufîe phase In Fig 3 we illustrate an example of different communication patterns in the shufîe phase In this example there are totally three compute nodes where each node is assigned with different number of processes with only one process acting as the aggregator During the shufîe phase the aggregator either sends the data to processes on other nodes which results in inter-node communication or redistributes the data within the same node which results in intra-node communication As a consequence each aggregator will have different shufîe cost Based on the above analysis we can derive the following equation to predict the shufîe cost T  max  max  m ai B a  max  m ej B e   002  max  m ai B a  m ej B e  002 1 where T is the total shufîe cost of one aggregator m ai is the i th intra message size MByte and 0 i<A  where A is the total number of intra communication m ej is the j th inter communication message size MByte 0 j<E  where E is the total number of inter-node communication B a is the saturated throughput of intra-node communication MB/sec B e is the saturated throughput of inter-node communication of a given cluster system MB/sec and 002 is the latency In order to distinguish the intra-communication and intercommunication at the runtime we need to know the Hydraês process-core binding strategy Hydra is a process management system compiled into the MPICH2 as a default process manager Without any user-deìned mapping we assume the basic default allocation strategy is used i.e round-robin mechanism using the OS speciìed processor IDs Whether the communication will be intra or inter can be determined with the following equation Comm is 002 intra if a _ id  n _ c  p _ id  n _ c inter else 2 where Comm is short for communication a _ id is the rank of the aggregator p _ id is the rank of non-aggregator processes and n _ c is number of cores per node B Acceptable Delay We introduce the Acceptable Delay AD in this study to support the hierarchical I/O scheduling An aggregatorês AD refers to the maximum acceptable time it can be delayed The AD is deìned as follows AD i  max  T 0 T 1 T 2 T n  T i 3 where AD i is i th aggregatorês acceptable delay and T i is i th aggregatorês shufîe cost Usually I/O requests from the same application are better to be serviced at the same time in order to achieve lower average response time However due to aggregators various ADs it is not necessary to do that which means we can utilize every aggregatorês AD to better schedule I/O requests by saturating one aggregatorês AD and servicing other applications rst We also deìne a Relative Acceptable Delay RAD as the rank in the ascending order of AD C HIO Algorithm The main idea of the hierarchical I/O scheduling algorithm is to utilize the aggregatorês acceptable delay to minimize the shufîe cost Because aggregators from different applications have various ADs we can not directly compare the AD from different applications The algorithm rst generates an initial order and then tunes the order by comparing the aggregatorês AD and read cost If one aggregatorês AD is larger than its successorês read cost then the order of the two requests can be exchanged The algorithm is described in Algorithm 1-HIO scheduling algorithm The outer loop  iton  1  in the algorithm is carried out in parallel because the scheduling is performed on each node separately The actual scheduling starts from the second loop  jtom  2  Each requestês AD is compared with its successorês read cost If agg j ad  agg j 1 read  then

214 


each node and determines each applicationês execution time Therefore we have the average total cost T i  1 m  mt  m  max  s ij   t  max  s ij  6 For the worst case either the rst condition or the second condition is not satisìed If the rst condition is not met it indicates that applications slowest aggregators arrive at the same node Thus the total average cost is T i  1 m  t 2 t 3 t    mt  m  max  s ij   m 1 2 t  max  s ij  7 If the second condition is not met the slowest aggregatorês shufîe cost is close to zero With the HIO scheduling the initial order will be sorted by application id which means that the same application will be serviced at the same time Then we have the average total execution time same with 5 In another word the worst case of the HIO scheduling at least has the same performance as that of the server-io scheduling Comparing equations 4 and 5 the server-io scheduling can achieve an average cost reduction as the following T reduction  mt  max  s ij   t m n m  1 003 x 1 x n  m 1 2 t  max  s ij   m  1 2 t  t m n m  1 003 x 1 x n  m  1 2 t  n 003\004  8 The best case of the HIO scheduling can further reduce the cost of 5 by T b reduction  m 1 2 t  max  s ij   t  max  s ij   m  1 2 t 9 The theoretical analysis and this comparison show that the HIO scheduling achieves better scheduling performance especially when the shufîe cost keeps increasing due to highly concurrent accesses from large-scale HPC systems and/or big data retrieval and analysis problems V I MPLEMENTATION The aggregators shufîe cost and AD are calculated at the MPI-IO layer Our evaluation was carried out on the ROMIO that is included in MPICH2-1.4 It provides a high-performance and portable implementation of MPI-IO including collective I/O The MPICH2-1.4 and ROMIO provide a PVFS2 ADIO device We modiìed this driver to integrate the shufîe cost analysis and pass it to the PVFS server side scheduler as a hint When an application calls the collective read function ADIOI_Read_and_exch in ad_read_coll.c under the src/mpi/romio/adio/common the shufîe cost is calculated after the aggregators are allocated i.e ADIOI_Calc_ìle_domains The message size m is calculated with ADIOI_Calc_my_req and ADIOI_Calc_others_req The calculated shufîe cost is stored into a variable of PVFS-hint type The hint is passed to le servers along with I/O requests On the PVFS server side in the request scheduling function PINT_req_sched_post we implemented the HIO algorithm The original function only enqueues the coming requests into the tail of the queue while the HIO algorithm rst divides the waiting queue into several sequences and performs the scheduling within each sub-queue following the scheduling algorithm discussed in Section III VI E XPERIMENTS AND A NALYSES A Experimental Setup We have conducted tests on a 16-node Linux testbed with a total of 32 processors and 128 cores We conducted experiments with the mpi-io-test parallel I/O benchmark The proposed hierarchical I/O scheduling algorithm was compared with other scheduling strategies through tests We have also evaluated the HIO scheduling algorithm with a real climate science application The HIO scheduling algorithm is evaluated and compared with two other scheduling algorithms server-io scheduling denoted as SIO and a normal collective I/O denoted as NIO B Results and Analyses In the tests we rst run multiple instances of mpi-io-test simultaneously We conducted the experiments by specifying the number of aggregator as 6 and the number of processes as 50 for each application The I/O request size was set as 16 MBs a xed value We run with 6 12 24 and 48 processes simultaneously Six storage nodes were deployed The results are plotted in Figure 4 From the gure we can observe that the HIO scheduling outperformed other scheduling The total execution time was decreased by up to 34.1 compared with NIO and by up to 15.2 compared with SIO Furthermore when the number of concurrent applications increased the performance gain was even better We have conducted experiments with varying the request size too As reported in Figure 5 the I/O request size was set as 64KB 1MB 5MB and 10MB respectively The number of concurrent applications was set as six and the number of aggregators was conìgured as six too During these test we compared the ratio of shufîe cost against the total cost It was found that the ratio increased from 0.7 to 5.6 as the request size increased This fact matches with our 
215 


observation that the shufîe cost considerably increases when applications become more and more data intensive 002\003 004\003 005\002\003 005\004\003 006\002\003 006\004\003 007\002\003 007\004\003 010\003 005\006\003 006\011\003 011\012\003 Average Execution Time \(s Number of Concurrent Applications 013\014\015\003 016\014\015\003 017\014\015\003 Figure 4 Average execution time with concurrent applications 002 003 002\003 020\003 004 003 004\003 020\003 005 003 005\003 020\003 006 003 006\003 020\003 007 003 021 007\010\011 003 004\012\011 003\020 012\011 003 004\002\012\011 003 Average Execution Time \(s Request Size 022 013 023\003 014\013 023\003 015\013 023\003 Figure 5 Average execution time with different request size When the requests size increased the performance gain of using HIO scheduling was increased too from 6.8 to 18.3 in terms of the execution time reduction rate This result also matches with our theoretical analysis discussed in Section IV We have also evaluated the impact of the number of storage nodes and report the results in Figure 6 In these tests the number of aggregators in each application was set the same as the number of storage nodes in order to have each application access all storage nodes The request size was set as 15MBs and the aggregatorês request size is equal The number of storage nodes was varied as 2 4 6 8 and 16 We observe that from the Figure 6 the normal collective I/O did not scale well with the increasing size of the system While both HIO and SIO achieved better scalability we also nd that the HIO performed and scaled better than SIO The advantage of the HIO is due to the reduced shufîe cost As the number of storage nodes increased the inter-communication between aggregators and processes on different nodes also increased which has been conìrmed in a prior study too It can be projected that as the system scale keeps increasing in the big data computing era the shufîe cost in the two-phase collective I/O will become a critical issue The proposed HIO scheduling in this study is essentially for addressing this issue and is likely to be promising at the exascale/extremescale of HPC system 002\003 006\003 002 003 003 003 004 003 005\002\003 005\006\003 005 002 003 005 003 003 005 004 003 006\002\003 013\014\015\003 016\014\015\003 017\014\015\003 Average Execution Time \(s 006\003 002 003 003 003 004 003 005 003 003 Figure 6 Average execution time with different storage nodes We have evaluated the HIO scheduling with a real climate science application and datasets from the Bjerknes Center for Climate Research as well This set of tests was speciìcally for understanding the beneìts of the HIO scheduling for a special access pattern accessing 2D planes in scientiìc datasets In scientiìc computing scientists are interested in understanding the phenomenon behind the data by performing subsets queries Those subsets queries usually happen in the 2D planes e.g parameters along time dimension and level dimension in a climate science data The datasets can range between GBs and TBs Previous studies have shown the poor scalability of collective I/O due to high concurrency and I/O interruption The proposed HIO algorithm addresses this issue by better scheduling concurrent I/Os The total dataset size evaluated in this series of tests is more than 12 GBs We run multiple 2D subsets queries concurrently using the FASM system and performed the HIO scheduling We run 20 queries for each dataset A sample query statement is like select temperature from dataset where 10  temperature  31 These queries were generated randomly and followed a global normal distribution The performance gain with the HIO scheduling compared to the conventional collective I/O is shown in Table I It can be observed that the HIO scheduling improved the average query response time clearly and by up to 59.8 All these tests have well conìrmed that the proposed hierarchical I/O scheduling in this study can improve the performance of collective I/O given highly concurrent and interrupted accesses It holds a promise for big data problems and scientiìc applications on large-scale HPC systems

R ELATED W ORK Parallel I/O scheduling has been widely studied by many researchers at a hope of obtaining the peak sustained I/O performance Few of them however meets the current demand of data-intensive applications and big data analysis yet Disk-directed and serv er directed I/O[21 have been proposed to improve the bandwidth of disks and network servers respectively There are also numerous scheduling algorithms targeting the quality of service QoS 8 9 19 The proposed hierarchical I/O scheduling in this study takes one step further to optimize the scheduling of collective I/O while considering the highly concurrent I/O requests from data-intensive applications In a serv er side I/O coordination method is proposed for parallel le systems Their idea is to coordinate le servers to serve one application at a time in order to reduce the average completion time and in the meantime maintain the server utilization and fairness By re-arranging I/O requests on the le servers the requests are serviced in the same order in terms of applications on all involved nodes However without considering the shufîe cost in the collective I/O it is unlikely to achieve the optimal performance In  the authors proposed a scheme namely IOrchestrator to improve the spatial locality and program reuse distance by calculating the access distances and grouping the requests with small distance together These two works seem similar but differ in the motivation The rst one is based on the observation that the requests with synchronization needs will be optimized if they are scheduled at the same time whereas the latter one is motivated by exploring the programês spatial locality In the authors proposed three scheduling algorithms with considering the number of processes per le stripe and the number of accesses per process to minimize the average response time in collective I/O In servicing one aggregator instead of scheduling one stripe at a time in the increasing le offset order they propose to prioritize the le stripes based on their access degree the number of accessing processes Their work optimized the scheduling of stripes within an aggregator whereas our work focuses on the scheduling of aggregators Besides their work only considers the average I/O response time The reduced I/O response time however does not always lead to the reduced total cost that includes the I/O response time and the shufîe cost In 3 4 13 the authors discussed the increasing shufîe cost in todayês HEC system too Their discussions are for motivating the importance of node re-ordering for reducing the collective I/Oês shufîe cost Their work provides a method to evaluate the shufîe cost and designed algorithms to automatically assign the aggregators at the node level whereas our work focuses on the scheduling of aggregators considering highly concurrent accesses to achieve the optimal collective I/O performance There exist other works that address the scientiìc data retrieval issues by optimizing the data organization 12 These works provide efìcient mechanisms from the data level and t the access pattern of scientiìc applications Our work also improves the applicationês accesses most of which are non-contiguous but through a hierarchical scheduling There are also works utilizing existing database techniques and compression algorithms to boost the big data analysis For example Fastbit implemented bitmap index in the large datasets ISABELA impro v ed the big data query by compressing the datasets Our w ork focuses on collective I/O scheduling which is beneìcial and critical to big data retrieval and analysis too VIII C ONCLUSION Collective I/O has been proven a critical technique in optimizing the non-contiguous access pattern in many scientiìc applications run on high-performance computing systems It can be critical for big data retrieval and analysis too as non-contiguous access pattern also commonly exists in big data problems The performance of collective I/O however could be dramatically degraded due to the increasing shufîe cost caused by highly concurrent accesses and interruptions This problem tends to be more and more critical as many applications become highly data intensive In this study we propose a new hierarchical I/O scheduling for collective I/O to address these issues This approach is the rst considering the increasing shufîe cost involved in collective I/O Through theoretical analyses and experiments it has been conìrmed that the hierarchical I/O scheduling can improve the performance of collective I/O In the future we will apply the similar approach for write operations We will analyze the feasibility of implementing hierarchical I/O scheduling only at the MPI-IO layer as well A CKNOWLEDGMENT
