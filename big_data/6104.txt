Virtual Health Management Joseph M. Woodside Department of Decision and Information Sciences DeLand, USA joseph.m.woodside@gmail.com   Abstract   By 2030, 49% of the US population are projected to have a chronic condition, accounting for 78% of total healthcare costs.  Despite significant investments in healthcare and information technology, healthca re costs continue to rise and errors still persist.  A smarter he alth and well ness focus is required to allow proactive and preventative care through virtual health management conducted by patients and their care team, in a patient-centric and patient empowered information environment, resulting in a proactive and preventative care There are many new healthcare management opportunities and technical challenges as a result of Big Data and outcomes can be further improved when combined with self-management.    A virtual health management solution with the components of Big Data sharing, decision support, virtual management, and care team monitoring is critical to improving quality and reduction of costs  Keywords  Big Data, Healthcare, Virtual Health, SelfManagement, Patient-Centric, Virtual Management, Well-Being Business Intelligence I  I NTRODUCTION  He althcare generates 30 percent of the worldês data according to estimates, with 65 percent of survey respondents indicating their data storage will grow at a rate between 25-50 percent per year [1   d r iv e n p r im arily  by im agin g f iles  electronic health records, personal health records, and scanned documents.  Despite this growth in volume, few healthcare providers have developed a formal strategy for handling the increasing amounts of data [2  Big Data in healthcare reflects the volume, growth, and types of data, as well as the tremendous opportunities available.  In one report Big Data in healthcare was expected to be valued at $300 billion in the next decade, with annual growth between 1.2  2.4 Exabytes per year [3  T h e h e al th  ca re in du st ry is w ell b e hin d  ot h e r  industries in utilizing Big Data effectively.  In healthcare the discussions have surrounded how to develop value for quality care, how to share data, how to utilize business intelligence how to distribute information to multiple stakeholders, and address all interests [4  Healthcare costs continue to exceed inflation rates, with 18 percent of the gross domestic product \(GDP\ spent on healthcare.  By 2020, 19.8 percent of GDP is expected to be consumed by healthcare for a total of $4.6 trillion    T h e chronically ill patient population in the U.S. utilizes 78% of total health care costs, 76% of hospital admissions, 88% of prescriptions, and 72% of physician visits.  In an effort to address chronically ill patients, Disease Management programs seek to better manage the population through education, and empowering patients to self-manage and monitor their illnesses.  Disease Management is a system of coordinated interventions for patient conditions that are significantly self-managed and supports the clinical-patient relationship, and focuses on pr evention using evidence-based guidelines and patient empowerment.  Disease management programs include heart disease, heart failure, diabetes pulmonary disease, and asthma The patient then follows established evidence b ased treatments, and is sent reminders for medication, screenings, and education.  These Disease Management programs consider that knowledgeable patients will receive less emergency vi sits, hospitalizations, errors, and reduce costs [6-9  Extending Disease Management beyond only chronically ill patients, Population Health Management targets programs to patients to improve health outcomes across the entire continuum of low-risk to high-risk patients.  Population Health Management programs are increasing as employers health plans, and other stakeholders seek ways to reduce costs and improve outcomes through patient involvement.  Despite interest in the programs, a limited understanding exists for the programs, and programs are s till in the early stages with research ongoing for the most effective methods for improving the entire population.  In addition, while large employers have implemented programs, there is a lack of programs for many individuals self-employed or with smaller companies    To address these challe nges, and improve health and well being, a patient centric Big Data information environment incorporating the tenants of Disease Management and Population Health Management, through Big Data Sharing Decision Support, Virtual Manage ment, and Monitoring is required  II  V IRTUAL H EALTH M ANAGEMENT A PPLICATION   An evaluation of a solution design for an artifact is explored to improve patient management  P opu lation  Health Management and Disease Management include data capture, decision support identification, virtual management for evidence based guidelin es, collaborative care models

The patient centric model for virtual health management is therefore critical for long-term cost reduction and quality improvements   T h e u tilit y of t h e artif act a n d h i gh u s a g e  rates by patients and providers must also include an incentive component, as many large employers who have implemented population health management and disease management programs find vendors ineffective in changing memberês lifestyle decisions and compliance with preventative care programs.  Incentives must be given to individuals such as cash, gift cards, or merchandise, and was rated as one of the major recommended changes to improve results according to recent surveys.  Provider incentives should also be added with shared savings, care coordination payments, and electronic use    Details are provided via a sample output for a patientcentric health management solution.  For managers, the components of Big Data Sharing, Decision Support, Virtual Management, and Care Team Monitoring are critical to addressing smarter health and well being through the ability for patients to manage their own conditions.  A separate expanded version lists the components as included in Disease Management and Population Health Management programs along with Target Population, Health Costs, and Patient Management considerations  B  Future Directions Future directions include evaluating the Big Data design on an expanded production patient population, and measuring associated outcomes.  Addition al future research includes evaluating the disruptive strate gy of patient self-management in health care, and methods to gain competitive advantages as a healthcare organization, through cost and quality of care improvements and unlocking the full potential value of Big Data in population health management and virtual monitoring   IV  R EFERENCES   1 M.

Using physical redundancies multiple versions are used 0501\051 as alternatives with separate kinds of error detection 0502\051 in pairs to implement detection by replication checks or 0503\051 in larger groups to enable masking by voting In general masking for dynamic correction/hiding of faults is done For application of the introduced techniques several concepts exist The concepts are clustered by detection and correction in a taxonomy of fault tolerance see Fig 2 050adapted from Figure 2  Taxonomy of Fault Tolerance We are particularly interested in a multi-version technique triggered by errors Recovery Blocks  by Randell follo ws the principle of checkpointing  roll-back for backward error recovery It's basic structure is depicted in Fig 3 050adapted from Figure 3  Multi-Version System with Recovery Blocks Following the procedure depicted in Fig 4 050adapted from running versions are continuously checkpointed If an error occurs during execution the determination of an alternate version is triggered by an exception If the execution still fails 050negative results from acceptance test\051 the previous checkpoint is restored and a new iteration of the procedure restarts until a valid alternative version is found 050if any\051 The testing of alternate versions is possible by parallel or sequential execution based on performance needs If no version satis\002es the tests at all the error leads to system halt Alternate versions might provide degraded performance i.e less accuracy is acceptable This corresponds with our meaning of qualitative ratings of con\002gurations The deselection of a version remains temporary i.e a reselection of a formerly discarded version after changes in input or system's state is possible In summary the NASA uses well-established multi-variant techniques for hardware and software fault tolerant techFigure 4  Procedure of Recovery Blocks niques In general performance drawbacks are acceptable it is most important to keep the system running Ef\002cient fault tolerance depends on physical redundancy A major challenge still remains in the selection of appropriate alternate versions At least a recon\002guration still depend on user commands 3 A N A PPROACH FOR S ELF R ECONFIGURATION ON A RCHITECTURAL L EVEL In the domain of embedded systems and component-based system development sets of functional components 050representing software\051 are allocated to subsets of resources of a hardware platform The structure and the redundancy relations between components allocated to resources are speci\002ed by a 050software\051 architecture For our purposes we extend this notion of architectures by information about architectural quality and usage Architectural Extension De\002nition 1 An quality-rated Architecture A is a triple h UM  FM  q i where 017 Usage Model UM describes the 050partial\051 satisfaction of goals 050as usage scenarios\051 by functional components 017 Functional Model FM is a component-based functional structure 017 Quality q 2 0   is an accumulated qualitative rating of the architecture The models UM and FM build up a layered architecture that is deployed to a hardware platform In addition we are concerned with the usage of functional components by means of scenarios in a usage model De\002nition 2 A Usage Model UM is a pair h U S 002 i where 017 US is a 002nite set of usage scenarios and 017 002  U S  0   is a satisfaction rating for a usage scenario An usage scenario describes in what manner a resources is utilized to satisfy a mission goal Scenarios just might be preformed partially depending on the availability of a resource and its redundancy relations This leads us to an additional rating of satisfaction for scenarios In the example 3 


in Fig 5 the usage scenario us 2 is separated into two satisfaction ratings for us 2 a and us 2 b  where 002\050 us 2 a 051  002\050 us 2 b 051  If comp 2 a is used as alternative to comp 2 b  us 2 is still ful\002lled but with less satisfaction We abstract from the hardware platform of a system Our software-oriented concept relies on relations between functional components for communication The allocation of components to hardware resources is described by requirements between hardware and software This implies the propagation of redundancy relations between resources to the level of the functional model De\002nition 3 A Functional Model FM is a 4-tuple h Comp Conn 011  005 i where 017 Comp is a 002nite set of atomic functional components  017 Conn is a 002nite set of connectors  017 011  Comp  T is a typing relation  where T  f sensor control actuator g  and 017 005 022 Comp 002 Conn 002 Comp is a message relation  We differentiate between three types of components Sensor and actuator components represent their corresponding hardware resources at functional level In this way measurements and control commands are made accessible as variables in the software Control components describe the logics 050computations commanding\051 of a subsystem The quality q of an architecture is based on a combination of several quality attributes 050e.g availability costs modi\002ability    051 structured in a quality model QM  De\002nition 4 A Quality Model QM is a pair h M ES i where 017 M is a 002nite set of executable metrics and 017 ES  is a 002nite evaluation structure as quality attributed directed acyclic graph 050QADAG\051 Example\227 An architecture with one unique and two redundant components and a minimized hardware platform is depicted in Fig 5 The hardware resources res 2 a and us 2 a us 1 us 2 b us 3  U M comp 2 a comp 1 comp 2 b comp 4  msg 2 a  msg 2 b F M res 2 a res 1 res 2 b res 4  conn 2 a  conn 2 b  Platform             Figure 5  Architecture with Redundancy and Platform res 2 b are related to each other in a kind of redundancy This relation is propagated to the level of functional components In case of a fault of res 2 a  the system is able to continue 050alternative\051 operation with res 2 b  The fault leads to a change of the parametrization and deployment of the software Here comp 2 b represents a slightly changed variant of comp 2 a  adapted for the execution on resource res 2 b  Messages and communication lines are redirected respectively Structure for Recon\002guration Decisions To enable self-recon\002guration we relate a prede\002ned set of quality-rated architectures In case of a resource fault a decision mechanism determines a best-\002tting alternative architecture from the set of all valid architectures Technically a hardware fault results in a change of the set of functional components based on prede\002ned relations 050requirements\051 between hardware and software Redundancy is either implementable by total replacement with identical resources or by partial replacement with emulating resources In both cases less agility or accuracy in sensing or actuation might be possible As decision structure we propose a timed automaton  like graph with architectures from A as locations to identify alternate versions upon resource faults Architectures are equipped with minimum requirements 050as invariants of a timed automaton\051 constituted in a set of resources We do not explicitly model failures e.g as labels/triggers of transitions De\002nition 5 An Architecture Relation Graph ARG is a 4-tuple h A I  Req i where 017 A 022 A is a set of valid architectures 017 I 022 A is the set of initial architectures 017  022 A 002 A is a distance relation between architectures and 017 Req  A  P 050 R 051 maps architectures to subsets of all resources R 017 If j I j  1  then ARG is called deterministic A con\002guration of an ARG consists of an architecture a 2 A and the current hardware con\002guration hc which represents the set of all currently enabled hardware components The relations between a and hc is described by minimal requirements of Req\050a\051  The set of all hardware components is denoted by HC 022 P 050 R 051  A con\002guration is an element of A 002 HC  Note that not all elements of A 002 HC build a valid con\002gurations A transition from one valid con\002guration into another is triggered by a resource fault Usually if an available hardware component fails the component is no longer available i.e if hc is a hardware con\002guration and r 2 hc fails the new hardware con\002guration is hc 0  hc nf r g  For practical application we integrate our concept with approaches for FDIR and adaptive system design Integration As depicted in Fig 6 our decision structure provides an implementation of a selection switch of Recovery Blocks Instead of versions on code level we consider architectures on a high level of abstraction Inputs provided by sensing represent external measurements from an environment and outputs are control variables required by actuation To specify the dynamics of an ARG  we use the MAPE approach Based on the principle of a control loop we describe the procedure of the reaction on a hardware fault 4

in combination reaction wheels and a magnetic coil system Reaction wheels provide the agility for movements The magnet coil system solely would not be suf\002cient to meet the requirements of agility and accuracy However the reaction wheels would either not work alone because they have to desaturated i.e the angular momentum is reduced by an external torque 050coils in response to the earth's magnetic 002eld\051 Both systems in combination allow different attitude modes with different attitude requirements 017 Uniaxial e.g to the sun 017 Relative inertial 3-axis stabilized e.g for a point in time 017 Absolute inertial 3-axis stabilized e.g to the earth To enable a three-axis stabilization TET-1 needs a reaction wheel in each axis However four wheels are mounted in a hot redundant con\002guration This tetrahedral con\002guration allows a malfunction of one of the four wheels without a loss of performance The magnet coil system is internally redundant i.e each coil consists of two windings each with an independent electrical interface The star tracker consists of two cold redundant data processing units 050DPUs\051 each being connected to the two camera head units 050CHUs\051 The magnetic 002eld sensor and the gyrosystem are cold redundant and there are two sun sensor systems in hot redundancy The high degree of the system's availability is implemented by several autonomy mechanisms If something fails the system autonomously switches to the ACS safe mode that guarantees contact to ground stations and power supply FDIR in ACS The ACS software of TET-1 consists of multiple layers the low level layer the high level layer and the interface layer see Fig 9 The FDIR mechanisms at low level inspect the communication structures between components Afterwards formal checks are performed e.g it is checked if data arrives with correct check sums at the right time and with the valid identi\002ers As a result a 002rst status information is derived which is forwarded to the estimator module in the next higher level High level analyses and FDIR occurs in the EPC layer Figure 9  Overview of the ACS of TET-1 Astround Feinwerktechnik Adlershof 050the high layer\051 of the ACS software If a component failed the 002rst level of FDIR checks in the lower layer its status is set to unhealthy for the current control cycle Measurements of the healthy sensors are compared to predicted sensor states and the deviance between measurements and predicted values is compared to tolerance boundaries The used tolerance boundaries are ACS parameters that can be changed by tele command 050TC\051 The result is that sensors and actuators in the corresponding ACS con\002guration vectors are otherwise marked with healthy 050everything is in order\051 or not healthy 050something is not correct\051 These checks are always renewed impartially in each control cycle and independently of their history except when on ground the decision has already been made and commanded Sensors can also have the state powered/not powered which is usually derived from the relay status of the component but can also be set by TC The used/not used 003ag indicates if the components shall be used for attitude determination and control in this control cycle This state can be set by the mode controller 050i.e not using the star tracker during rough sun pointing\051 but can also be set by TC Sensors marked unhealthy are ignored by the high level software and their measurements are predicted however no autonomous hardware switch to the redundant unit is performed An important FDIR mechanism of the ACS is the ACS surveillance monitor It monitors the software threads and logs important events inside the ACS Particular monitoring is performed on the time dependencies necessary for a correct communication between threads For speci\002c timing violations and major deviances between the actual and expected threads the surveillance monitor requests the reboot of the satellite board computer 050SBC\051 and/or the satellite safe mode because the functionality of the ACS is vital for the survival of the satellite The triggering of a satellite safe mode can be deactivated temporarily 050e.g software upload\051 with known restrictions during the operation of the satellite Moreover log entries are kept and telemetry is made available also from the previous control cycle where the failure did not occur yet If the surveillance monitor requests reboot or safe mode the occurred failure could therefore not be solved on the subsystem level but passed to the next level of the satellites FDIR system While fault detection and isolation are part of the subsystem recovery is left to the operational team on ground Thus full recon\002gurations still depend on tele commands Hence we propose a quality-based approach for autonomic recon\002gurations on architectural level For that we introduce an evolution scenario of the ACS subsystem Evolution Scenario We assume that an emulation of the attitude control by reaction wheels 050RW1,2,3,4\051 is possible by an enhanced variant of the magnet coil system 050MCS\051 The evolved system is still imprecise and less agile On the one hand attitude control needs more time to change the position of the satellite on the other hand total energy consumption of the system is low As depicted in Fig 10 we de\002ned three architectures of attitude control for the given evolution scenario Here we focus on recon\002gurations on a functional level and abstract from usage scenarios 050e.g a speci\002c mission goal\051 To apply our approach to the evolved system some preparations for self-recon\002guration has to be done at design time The basic steps are 0501\051 to de\002ne architectures 0502\051 to measure their quality and 0503\051 to arrange the architectures in an ARG including the speci\002cation of hardware requirements for each architecture 050see Fig 11\051 6

fatal resources faults by backwards-traversation from the failsafe mode system con\002gurations In future work we will extend our tool set for modeling of an ARG and the simulation of faults Furthermore we will focus on the modeling of a highly redundant and con\002gurable full-\003edged ACS architecture for comprehensive evaluations This includes the extension of the system by several redundant elements based on typical redundancy scenarios for large space crafts A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors thank the company Astround Feinwerktechnik Adlershof GmbH from Berlin Germany for details

  Paper 2581 Version 2  14   Flight i nformation and processing   Presentation and projection of flight profiles   Real time operational information   Managing both pilot operator and air traffic controller workloads   Procedural processes supported by enhanced automation capabilities   Control sector complexity and management   Separation a ssurance   Airspace d esign and p rocedures   Investment in resolving these constraints  will drive the rate of adoption in civil UAS operations in the NAS One p art of the investment will be driven by the FAA\222s \223F acilities and Equipment\224 F&E Budget over  the next ten years Another part will be driven by defense and federal investment  in R&D  The remaining part will be driven by private investment seeking to develop profitable supplie r s and manufacturing firms of UAS Unfortunately   private investment will not fully launch until there is a clear indication of the public investment into implementing the requisite air traffic management  and air traffic control  ATM/ATC changes into the NAS infrastructure and there i s a common  approach through avionic standards in UA V  equipage   It is expected that avionic standards would lower the end user costs The impact on NAS infrastructure is the outline in the following subsection  Today\222s Air Traffic Control System  Today\222s air traffic control system is built around four basic pillars. These are communications, navigation, surveillance and infrastructure. The mortar holding these pillars together is aviation policy, rules and procedures  The FAA Air Traffic Organizat ion \(ATO\ has identified over 25 FAA procedural orders and notices that will need to be revised to accommodate routine  UAS operations in the NAS. This does not include advisory and informational materials that need to be developed and briefed to air traffi c controllers, pilots and other aviation stakeholders Additionally NAS investments to accommodate UAS efforts and associated costs must extend  beyond training requirements and procedural developments to include modification of infrastructure to permit an d to optimize efficiency and safety of UAS operations in the NAS  The majority of UAS operating in the NAS today are predominantly operated by the DoD. They were not designed with NAS compatibility in mind but rather to meet military mission needs. It is e xpected future commercial UAS will be designed and operated much more along the lines of manned aircraft. For example, current DoD UAS do not have Flight Management Systems and associated NAS aeronautical database and cannot be program m ed to fly approved F AA instrument procedures such as an instrument landing system \(ILS\ approach. Future commercial UAS operating in the NAS will need have integrated avionics systems and NAS capabilities similar to those of manned aircraft. However, unique challenges associa ted with UAS will remain and drive functional changes across many NAS project and programs. Some of these anticipated drivers or changes are listed by FAA program area below  En Route Automation Modernization \(ERAM 227 ERAM will be impacted by the need to be able to accept and process and display lengthy and complex UAS flight plans that include automated flight profile contingencies to the air traffic controller. This includes the ability to display a 20 minute planned route of flight on a controller\222s displa y suite  ERAM needs to be able to display to review to modify and to approve a UAS flight plan request originating in an en route center airspace environment as a 24 hour file and fly replacement to the current constrained  COA  process now is in use  Nati onal Voice System \(NVS  227 Future air traffic control voice switching systems must be able to provide timely and direct pilot to controller voice and data e.g text messaging\ communications via Voice Over Internet Protocol \(V o IP  Terminal Automation Mode rnization and Replacement TAMR  227 TAMR needs to be able to display to review to modify and to approve a UAS flight plan request originating in a terminal airspace environment as a 24 hour file and fly replacement to the current constrained COA  process now is use. TAMR also needs to be able to surveil approved UAS flights within the terminal environment  Terminal Information Display System \(IDS\ and En Route Information Display System \(ERIDS  227 Information support systems need to be able to inges t to and  to rapidly display unique local procedures and associated graphics associated with UAS operations. These include pilot communications and UAV control lost ink procedures  System Wide Information Management \(SWIM  227 SWIM  must be able to rapidly mov e critical UAS information around the NAS to provide the right information to the right controller or pilot at the right time and in the desired  format  Flight Information Exchange Model \(FIXM  227 UAS flight information needs to move to and from other Air Navigation Service Providers \(ANSP\ throughout the world and new data terminology must be created that supports the collection, processing and dissemination of UAS movements through the airspace  Air Traffic Control Optimum Training Solutions \(ATCOTS  227 UAS provides new training challenges for FAA in creating new teaching curricula that contains new procedures and paradigms used to accommodate UAS safely and efficiently in the NAS. This is notable c hallenge given 


  Paper 2581 Version 2  15  the diversity and dynamic of evolving UAS technologies and missions  Future Facilities 227 FAA real estate assets may likely be affected as new UAS related systems are development and deployed. UAS NAS integration may drive additional FAA manpow er needs for positions of operations, coordination and management. This may require additional physical footprints to accommodate new positions of operations personnel and their supporting infrastructure  Next Generation Weather Processor \(NWP\ and Weathe r and Radar Processor \(WARP  227 The removal of a pilot in the cockpit also removes the ability to \223see\224 from a traditional pilot\222s perspective. Not only does this relate to the need for electronic systems for detect and avoid \(i.e., the FAR reference 91.113 for see and avoid\ but also affects many aspects of flight safety associated with detection and avoidance of hazardous weather from visual perspective of the manned cockpit. Determination of flight visibility is one such factor. It should also be noted tha t many of the UAS flying in the NAS today have a very low tolerance to hazardous weather such as turbulence and icing  Detect and Avoid \(DAA  227  Depending upon architecture and functionality, detect and avoid for UAS could have a profound impact on a variety of FAA systems and infrastructure components. DAA can be airborne based, and affect Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast \(ADS B\ In and Out and an associated Cockpit Display of Traffic Information \(CDTI\nd Traffic Alert and Collision Avoida nce System \(TCAS\ functionality, including designs for the new Next Generation Airborne Collision Avoidance Systems \(ACAS X\. GBSAA that leverages ASR 11 Surveillance Radars and Standard Terminal Automation Replacement Systems \(STARS\ or TAMR also demands automation and surveillance system modification to provide this capability. Additional future work on portable primary three dimensional \(3D\ radars integrated in the NAS will also demand close analysis  The previous overview of FAA air traffic control sys tems gives insight in the investment required to be undertaken within the F AA\222s F&E  budget It also s erve s to illustrate the pervasiveness of changes that the UAS will eventually have on air traffic control and its supporting  ATM  infrastructure   It is impo rtant to recognize these ATM/ATC changes need to be planned for, funded and deployed. It must also be recognized that these UAS related investments do not stand alone in that these changes must be done while other planned ATC system improvements are taking  place I nvestments   such as   the Surveillance Broadcast System Program  National Voice Switch, Future Cyber Security Data Communications, and others are planned under the Next Generation Air Transport System  NextGen and others  Obviously   if future UA S forecasts are to be sustained it will entail a major shift in current FAA investment in addition to the  currently planned funding of NextGen  The forecasts outlined in this paper  will require an increase in funding levels of between $500 million and $1 billion dollars per year over and above current FAA requested F&E funding levels   Doing so will greatly facilitate realization of the $30 billion per year UAS market  9   S UMMARY  From an aviation perspective, UAS represents a new and disruptive technology  challenging the staid institutions policy, procedures and technologies that exist today and have served manned aircraft well for the last fifty years or more. This UAS technology supports an incredibly wide range of uses that not only allows old challeng es to be addressed in new ways but also creates new innovative world markets for hundreds, if not thousands, of new creative applications answering the call of \223better, faster and cheaper.\224  A growing number of early adopters and innovators of aviation tech nologies are beginning to realize the significance of a growing diversity and number of UAS  This growth  is  driven by a confluence of technological developments in airframes, powerplants, sensor s command and control sys tems and information management The  economic  value  of this industry projected to be $30 billion per year supporting 300,000 American jobs by 2035   As concluded b y the study team   the realization of UAS market forecasts will be constrained  unless key investment is performed in   The NAS ATC/A TM facilities needed to be updated to support new aircraft performance and controller capabilities   Training for ATC to be ready to adopt the new unmanned aircraft performance with acceptable workload    ATC to pilot communications that have the availability  integrity confidentiality and continuity as to not heavily impact either  pilot o r  controller workload   Development of Civil standards for the c ontrol and communications data link that w ill foster low cost access for a b road  range of UAS 226  this could in clude standards of f orm, fit and function as well as covering signal in space  networked channel  access and common control exchange applications    This key investment will develop a C 3  approach to support NAS integration.  It is agreed that other areas such as of DAA are important for investment, but there are already multiple economic incentive s  following this path
