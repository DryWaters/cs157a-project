t and beyond 1 2 3  Here we describe a novel technique for generating the frequency predicts that are used to compensate for relative Doppler derived from interpolated earth position and spacecraft ephemerides The method described here guarantees velocity and range estimates that are consistent with each other hence one can always be recovered from the other. Experimental results have recently proven that these frequency predicts a re accurate enough to maintain  the phase of a three element array at the EPOXI spacecraft for three hours Previous methods derive frequency predicts directly from interpolated relative velocit 
ies However these velocities we re found to be inconsistent with the  corresponding spacecraf t range meaning that range could not always be recovered accurately from the velocity predicts and vice versa Nevertheless velocity based predicts are also capable of maintain ing  uplink array phase calibration for extended periods as demonstrated with  the EPOXI spacecraft  however with these predicts important range and phase information may be lost  A comparison of the steering vector method with velocity based techniques for generating precise frequency predicts specifically for uplink array applicat ions is  provided in the following sections

January 6 200 9   3 The research described in this paper was carried out at the Jet Propulsion  Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under contract with the  National Aeronautics and Space Administration    1  I NTRODUCTION  Coherent arraying of antennas transmitting uplink signals to a spacecraft is a novel concept that will greatly increase NAS A\325s deep space communications capabilities in the future 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Typically, deep space missions require the capability to command the spacecraft right after launch during cruise, and after encountering the target, in order to   provide two 
way com munication and ranging In addition in flight reconfiguration may be required to accommodate unforeseen changes in mission objectives The use of antenna arrays enables much greater data rates greater effective operating distance and cost effective scal ing for more demanding future missions through a highly flexible design philosophy, via the inherently parallel architecture of antenna arrays   The DSN uplink arrays are arrays of N microwave antennas operating at X band, transmitting signals that add coh erently at the spacecraft, thus providing a power gain of N 2 over a single antenna However earth rotation and 
consequent relative motion between the spacecraft and the transmitting antennas requires the generation of extremely accurate frequency predicts  for each antenna in order to cancel differential Doppler and enable coherent combining at the spacecraft. This gain can be traded off directly for N 2 higher data rate at a given distance such as Mars providing for example HD quality video broadcast from earth to a future manned mission or it can provide a given data rate for commands and software uploads at a distance N  times greater than currently p ossible with a single antenna   2  U PLINK ARRAY FREQUENC 
Y PREDICT ALGORITH M S   The requirement to maintain coherence of the uplink array carriers at t he spacecraft mak e it necessary to refine the existing single antenna predicts and even develop a new appr oach to generate greatly improved frequency predicts  specifically for arraying applications  With the relatively long baselines formed by the Apollo complex 258m to 500m\, it was found necessary to refine the positions of the antenna phase centers, after position errors as large as 60 cm were discovered in the DSN data base.  The long baselines 


 2  lead directly to time varying differential Doppler between the array antennas due primarily to earth rotation hence any inaccuracy in the antenna position vector s can lead to significant frequency prediction errors In a previous experiment, the position errors in the DSN data base led to differential frequency erro rs of approximately 1 m illi Hz in the ITT frequency predicts the official predicts supplied to the stations used during the previous EPOXI Uplink Array experiment February 8 th  2008 Accurate position vectors derived fro m previous VLBI measurements  were used to yield much more accurate position vectors and hence led to  greatly improved frequency pre dicts for the uplink array   The p ointing vector approach to frequency predicts is based on the observation that the differential Doppler frequencies are the most important components of the frequency predicts for array applications, instead of absolute fr equency accuracy In general frequency predicts are designed to freeze the received frequency at the spacecraft at a predetermined value by cancelling Doppler due to earth rotation and spacecraft trajectory dynamics However the Small Deep Space Transpo nder SDST aboard EPOXI operates with a 100 Hz loop bandwidth, and therefore it can easily track out small deviations from the design frequency after signal acquisition: therefore, it is sufficient to relate the frequency predicts for the array antennas t o the reference antenna predicts which need to be accurate enough to enable tracking by the SDST   The pointing vector based predicts posses several advantages over alternative approaches Calculation of projected geometric distances which are needed fo r array phase alignment from dot products are numerically more stable than calculations with differences of large frequency quantities Another advantage is the inherent geometric consistency of the predicts Frequency predicts can be calculated from deri vatives of projected geometric distances and these same geometric distances can be calculated from frequencies Note that the pointing based predicts are primarily constrained to be geometrically consistent and then if possible to stop the phase at the spacecraft. Other predicts are designed to stop the phase as a primary constraint and consider geometric consistency to be secondary Absolute frequency differences between the pointing based predicts and other predicts of up to 20 Hz and differential pha se differences as high as 100 degrees have been observed It is not clear which predicts actually freeze the phase at the target, but all predicts are well within the operational parameters of SDST transponders                          Figure 1  Components of pointing vecto r based frequency predicts    Referring to Fig 1  the position vectors from the reference antenna DSS 25 to the array antennas DSS 24/26 have been determined to millimeter accuracy using very accurate VLBI derived solutions These position vectors refer to the phase centers of the antennas which are defined as the intersection of the azimuth and elevation axes. The antennas must be pointed towards the spacecraft to within a small fraction of their 70 m illi deg beamwidths ho wever this is accomplished routinely using operational pointing predicts derived from earth and spacecraft ephemerides   Using any adequate single antenna frequency predict for DSS 25 as reference the differential frequencies for the auxiliary array antennas can be obtained by forming the inner product of the normalized pointing vector and the position vector from the reference antenna, as shown in Fig 5 for each predict point in time The single antenna frequency estimates already contain large Doppler due to relative motion between the reference antenna and the spacecraft Con verting relative velocities to Doppler frequencies at X band generally requires the use of the  relativistic Doppler equation    The instantaneous pathlength difference to the target between the reference and the auxiliary antennas can be converted to an instantaneous phase d ifference via multiplication by  where  cm is the wavelength of the nominally 7.18 GHz carrier Referring to Fig 5 the instantaneous pathlength difference can be determ ined as   for the Q th auxiliary antenna  where Q  1 2 3 in the fixed reference frame of the array The frequency difference between the Q th antenna and the reference antenna  i n this reference frame   is given by the rate of change of the pointing vector    Finally the frequency predict for the Q th antenna is the sum of the reference antenna predict and this frequency difference     The Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility NAIF at JPL offers an information system named SPICE to assist scientists in planning and interpreting scientific observations from space borne instruments SPICE is also widely used in engineering task s needing access to space 


 3  geometry SPICE is focused on solar system geometry time and other related information The SPICE system includes a large suite of software mostly in the form of subroutines, which customers use to read SPICE files and to comput e derived observation geometry such as altitude latitude/longitude, and illumination angles. SPICE data and software may be used within many popular computing environments. The software is offered in FO RTRAN, C and IDL\250, with a MATLAB\250 environments    Af ter a station location error in the DSN database was corrected it was observed that the above procedure was equivalent to and could be carried out more efficiently using NAIF range predicts directly together with the improved position vectors to obtain identical results This is not surprising since pointing vectors should be the same as normalized range vectors Therefore the actual frequency predicts for DOY 179 used during this experiment were computed using NAIF range predicts every 22 seconds. The frequency predicts for the reference antenna, DSS 25, were also derived in this manner for the DOY 179 experiment Until recently the NAIF range and velocity predicts were not consistent with each other Relative range and velocity estimates are obtained through Chebyshev expansion polynomial evaluations but the relative velocity was not constrained to equal the derivative of the relative position The inconsistency was not significant for single antenna applications but manifested itself as a diurnal accu mulated phase error between instantaneous range and velocity predicts of up to 100 degrees for array applications As a result an average velocity from which frequency predicts were derived consistent with range was estimated by computing the differen ce in range every 22 seconds. While the discrete difference is but an approximation of the range derivative, it is accurate enough for trajectories in which the magnitude of the relative velocity is dominated by Earth rotation The range velocity inconsist ency has since been eliminated in version N62 of the SPICE toolkit released March 2008 No compensation for tropospheric delay was implemented for the DOY179 experiment  3  S IMULATION AND EXPERI MENTAL RESULTS  For comparison during the experiment, and to pr ovide some degree of verification, three other sets of frequency predicts were derived using different techniques These were SPS predicts derived with development software official ITT predicts using operationally approved software; and Custom predicts using 322forward\323 and 322backward\323 intermediate results were first derived then averaged to obtain the final result. The key features of these techniques are as follows  a The ITT predicts are generated from modified versions of the NAIF kernels which take i nto account general relativity effects such as path length increases from gravitational effects of massive bodies. Tropospheric compensation based on a seasonal zenith delay model and Chao Mapping Function 7  model is supported by both ITT and SPS but was not used in this experiment  b  Fo r the Custom P redicts SPICE Routines from NAIF were used in developing a FORTRAN program to provide the various parameters of interest in support of the EPOXI experiment. Directions \(AZ EL\, geometric path lengths, RF p hases and Doppler frequency shifts for DSN Stations to EPOXI were evaluated In implementing the program as shown in Fig 2 a forward pass from the transmit station Tx to the spacecraft Sx and a backward pass from  spacecraft \(Sx\ back to the statio n \(Tx\ were first computed The pass involved the calculation of distance R and time delay LT to the target spacecraft, as well as the velocity v at the target These values were then used in calculating the transmit frequency F t  at the given time T 0  at the transmit station needed to provide the given frequency F r  at the spacecraft at calculated time T r   The actual values used in processing were then obtained by averaging over the forward and backward passes which provide the most accurate results In  this way a set of ephemeris data at the desired range of UTC times are calculated. The main NAIF routine utilized is SPKEZR which returns the state \(position and velocity\ of a target body relative to an observing body optionally corrected for light tim e \(planetary aberration\ and stellar aberrations  Tropospheric compensation was not added  c  SPS predicts used the same algorithms as the ITT predicts except that operational constraints are relaxed so that the most recent updates of ephemerides and ker nels are used which however may not be approved for operational applications    Figure 2 Graphic representation of steps in time/distance calculations from Ground Station to the Spacecraft   A comparison of the f our techniques namely ITT, Custom SPS and Pointing Based is show n in Figs 3 a, b, and c, for the third predict interval spanning 1500 1800 UTC on DOY 179 The dark blue curves refer to the DSS 24/25 baseline and the pink curves to DSS 25/26 Note the excellent agreement between the pointing v ector based and the custom predicts: the peak difference is about 0.5 degrees for DSS 24/25 and about 2.25 degrees for DSS 25/26 


 4  These differences would not lead to any measurable power fluctuations at EPOXI hence these predicts would yield essentially identical performance during the third interval   However, both the SPS and ITT predicts accumulate d phase linearly with respect to the pointing vector predicts amounting to approximately 17 degrees and 25 degrees for ITT and SPS respectively along the DSS 24/25 baseline and 20 degrees and 32 degrees for the DSS 25/26 baseline It can be inferred that the developmental SPS and operational ITT predicts differ from each other by only 8 degrees and 12 degrees for the two baselines hence eith er predic t set would yield similar performance    Fig ure  3 a Comparison of differential phase errors for Pointing based and Custom frequency predicts for both baselines third tracking interval    F ig ure  3 b  Comparison of differential phase errors for Pointing based vs ITT frequency predicts  for both baselines third tracking interval   An example of the application of the Pointing based frequency predicts is shown in Fig 4  where stable combined power can be seen for both two antenna combined power e.g 13:26:29 SCET and three antenna combined power e.g 13:40:53 SCET Power dips and fluctuations are due to transmission of No Op commands phase ramp calibration and other experimental activities carried out during the track. However, the combined powers remained stable throughout the duration of the track for more than five hours    Figure  3 c  Comparison of differential phase errors for Pointing based vs ITT frequency predicts third tracking interval     Figure 4   Real time CLA data Pointi ng Vector based predict set   The primary significance of this experiment was the demonstration of the ability to compensate for differential Doppler frequencies between all three baselines of a three antenna uplink array to an accuracy required to mainta in coherence between the transmitted fields over time scales typical of an operational pass This will enable the use of powerful arrays to transmit commands and data to deep space missions greatly increasing NASA\325s future communications and command capab ilities  4   S UMMARY AND C ONCLUSIONS  The first stable arraying of X band carriers at interplanetary distances from up to three operational antennas was demonstrated experimentally with the EPOXI spacecraft, on June 27 2008 The experiment was carried out  un der real world  conditions at the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex using the 34 meter BWG antennas located at DSS 24 DSS 25 and DSS 26 of the 


 5  Apollo complex  at Goldstone  The key component of this experiment was the determination of the diff erential Doppler frequency between all three Apollo stations in order to effectively stop any phase rotation at the spacecraft when all three antennas were transmitting This meant that the frequency predicts currently employed by the DSN had to be impro ved by about two orders of magnitude, in order to reduce power cycling at the spacecraft The approach taken was to assume that the current frequency predicts were accurate enough to enable carrier lock and phase tracking by the spacecraft which typically  operates with 100 Hz loop bandwidth and to generate differential frequency offsets based on array spacecraft geometry  A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  The authors would like to thank Jonathan Walther and the SPS and NAIF team members The research described in this pa per was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology, under a contract with the NASA Interplanetary Networking Directorate \(IND  R EFERENCES  1.

Figure 10 A portion of the section of the ontology that deals with information specific to the type of play Figure 10 also provides a glimpse into how the theoretical infinite chaining of events is handled in the ontology The subclasses of PlayType were given properties to indicate specific types of special occurrences which we termed InPlay Events Figure 11 shows a portion of this part of the ontology As the figure shows the In-Play Events were represented by one parent class called InPlayEvent and three subclasses InPlayFumble InPlayLateral and InPlayFumble These classes represent a fumble lateral and penalty that happened during the course of a play It should be noted that an InPlayPenalty was unique from an instance of the Penalty class which was a subclass of PlayType An example of an InPlayPenalty would be a facemask penalty tacked onto the end of a running play while an example of a Penalty would be a holding call on the offense which thereby invalidates any result of the play on which it occurred and thus becomes its own play Figure 11 A selection of the ontology dealing with InPlay Events As Figure 10 shows these InPlayEvents are referenced by pairs of properties The subclasses of PlayType where relevant contained a Boolean flag indicating whether a specific type of InPlayEvent occurred and a link to the instance of the InPlayEvent The general form of this pair of predicates was name of action]Occurred and action]ThatOccurred where action was either fumble lateral or penalty This section of ontology is perhaps best clarified through an example As an example let's consider the famous hookand-ladder play at the end of regulation of the Boise St vs Oklahoma game in the 2007 Fiesta Bowl In this play Jared Zabransky threw the ball to Drisan James for 15 yards James then lateraled the ball to Jerard Rabb who ran for an additional 35 yards and a touchdown with seven seconds remaining This play would first be represented as a PlayFromScrimmage seeing that it was not a point conversion attempt and as a CompletedPass with the typeOf link pointing to the instance of the PlayFromScrimmage The passer predicate of the CompletedPass would point to the instance of a Player representing Jared Zabransky and the receiver would point to an instance of Drisan James The fumbleOccurred and penaltyOccurred properties of the CompletedPass would be set to false but the lateralOccurred would be set to true Then an instance of an InPlayLateral would be created with the lateraler property set to Drisan James and the receiver set to Jerard Rabb The touchdown is then associated with the InPlayLateral Had another In-Play Event occurred all that would need to be done to expand the chain would be to set one of the action]Occurred variables of the InPlayLateral to true and create an instance of the next InPlayEvent subclass This methodology can be expanded to encode a theoretically infinite play Two paragraphs above we stated that the subclasses of PlayType contain the pairs of predicates where relevant The where relevant appears because it is not always possible for all of the In-Play Events to occur for a given subclass of PlayType For example on a stand-alone Penalty play such as a holding no fumble or lateral could possibly have occurred so the two pairs of properties representing an InPlayFumble and InPlayLateral were not included in the Penalty class This same type of reasoning was applied to all the subclasses of the PlayType to limit the options only to that which were permitted by the game of football 6 ONTOLOGIZING THE DATA With an ontology created we now turn our attention to the processing of putting the data into the ontology a process we refer to as ontologizing the data To ontologize both the football example and the combat simulations we wrote programs in Java The program for each domain had the same basic structure which was as follows 1 Read the ontology into the program 2 Read in and parse the input files 3 Put the information from the input files into the ontology 4 Read in and parse an event from the action log 5 Put the information from the action log into the ontology being sure to use the information from the input files 6 Repeat steps 4 and 5 for all the events 7 Write the ontology to permanent storage 6 


This recipe for ontologizing the data is a more detailed explanation of what is shown pictorially in Figure 3 It is important to realize that essentially all that is happening in this process is that the data are being extracted through parsing and then combined with the template ontology to form an encoded output just as the figure shows The steps listed above will be discussed in further detail in the subsequent paragraphs of this section The first step in ontologizing the data was to read the ontology into the Java program In order to perform this and all other actions required to manipulating the ontology the Jena Semantic Web Framework package or Jena was used.5Jena is an open-source Java Framework that serves as a programmatic environment for RDF RDFS OWL and SPARQL while also including a rule-based inference engine ref By reading a template ontology into Jena the user can programmatically create instances populate properties perform queries or perform a myriad of other tasks on the ontology Jena served as the backbone of our program With the ontology read in and ready to accept data in Jena we now turn to combining the relevant data with the template ontology to produce the structured output as shown in Figure 3 To this end steps 2 and 3 are essentially the same as steps 4 and 5 with only the source of the information being different For football the parsing of the files was made simpler by the fact that each player and play was given its own line in their respective files and the files were simply ASCII-text written in a format that was consistent from team to team for the rosters and within a play type in the play-to-play files That is each roster was structured in exactly the same way regardless of the team and each unique type of play had the same structure within a game and between games As a result traditional parsing techniques were used to parse the files For the rosters this simply meant that Java tools such as readLine and StringTokenizers were used The play-by-play was understandably much more complex but was parsed with a combination of using regular expressions to match the type of play and then using built in Java functions to perform further sentence examination This same methodology was used in the combat simulation program For structured delimited output tools such as readLine and StringTokenizers were used Conversely for freeform chronological accounts of events regular expressions were used to perform the coarse matching while built-in Java functions were used for the precise extraction of information within a sentence While parsing the play-by-play file or the output files in the simulation domain is quite time consuming to write and difficult to get perfected it is conceptually the easiest at a high level The program simply examines a line determines if it matches a pattern extracts the necessary information and stores it in data structures until it is put into the ontology 7 5 htp.H Jena.sourceforge.nlet As mentioned earlier Jena handled all interactions with the ontology including combining the extracted data with the template ontology We refer to the original ontology as the template ontology because it provides the definition of the structure that holds the data but has not yet been realized with actual instances of the data thereby serving as a template for the associated classes When the combination of actual data with the template structure happens we say we have an output ontology which can then be queried using SPARQL Thus in order to transition from the template ontology to the output ontology we need to create instances of the event classes and fill in their properties Creating an instance of an RDF class in Jena follows the same pattern regardless of the domain First the template of the class is found in the ontology using the getOntClass function This template is then used to create a specific instance of the class using the createlndividual function Now that an individual is created its properties are set by either using the addProperty or setPropertyValue functions depending upon whether the property can have more than one value or not The getProperty and createTypedLiteral functions are typically required to provide the arguments when using either of the property-filling functions This same methodology can literally be used for creating any instance of a RDF function in Jena and serves as the substance to the magic referred to originally in Data Integration Manager of Figure 2 To further clarify the process we will now discuss the specifics of the how the template ontology was transformed into the output ontology for the football example As mentioned in the steps for ontologizing the data above the input files or the rosters of the teams in the case of football were put into the ontology first When the roster file was opened an instance of the Team class was created and the name property populated using the methodology described in the previous paragraph Then the information for each individual player was read one at a time As mentioned previously the Player class was used to represent a player in the ontology As a result an instance of the Player class was created for all the individuals on the roster and the setPropertyValue function of Jena was used to set its properties By repeating this for every player on the roster all the actors in the scenario were put into the ontology Once the definition of an individual Player was completed the Player was added to the team using the addProperty function which was used to allow for multiple Players to be on the same team With the input files completely parsed the event log files were parsed next In both domains the majority of the information came in the form of ASCII-text strings that included the actors the action performed and the context of action For football this information typically included the involved players names the type of play the game situation and the stats about the play such as the yards that were gained As mentioned above regular expressions were 7 


used to match the type of the play and Java functions extracted the specific information However to be useful this information must be matched with the ontology To this end the type of play was translated into a specific subclass of the PlayType class while the context of the play was used to determine the appropriate subclass of the Play class and to fill in the properties of these two classes The names of the players involved in the play were used to find the actual instances of the specified Player in the ontology taken from the roster files By reading the rosters and creating the teams first we can leverage the actors in this way when ontologizing the events of the game This helps protect the validity of the data by ensuring that all references to an individual actor refer to the same entity regardless of how they are referred to in individual events This point is best clarified with an example To use the previous example from the Boise St vs Oklahoma game by referring back to the input files we ensure that all references in the play-by-play to Jared Zabransky Zabranksy number 5 for Boise St or any other tangent reference to a property are referring to the same Player in the ontology Maintaining data integrity in this way goes to the heart of using an ontology which strives to eliminate all reference ambiguity in the data The final step established above for ontologizing the data was to write the data to permanent storage The necessity of performing this step is predicated upon whether a database connection was established in the beginning or not In the early development of both domains we represented the ontology using Jena s memory model which stores the model and its associated triples in memory However given that combat simulations can produce many gigabytes of data with the number ever growing an alternative was required as every time the program was run with the memory model it crashed due to running out of heap space As Figure 2 suggests establishing a database connection quickly became one of the few viable options Towards these ends an Oracle lOg database was used to house the data due to Oracle's commitment in the 10g and the subsequent release of the 1 Ig to store RDF triples uniquely as opposed to performing a conversion to a traditional relational database every time Putting the information into the database had the desired benefit of greatly expanding the constraint on file size Additionally once the database was established optimizations could be performed on the data storage to improve the access speeds of common queries By putting the information in a sufficiently large database parsing becomes a truly one-time expense where it never has to be repeated If a database is used the program no longer has to read in the template ontology at the beginning and then write the output ontology to a file for permanent storage at the end Instead the program can simply establish a connection to the database when started and it then has access to all of the preexisting data including the template ontology 7 ANALYSIS Up to this point we have described in extensive detail the problem definition how the template ontology was created and how the data was extracted and combined with the template ontology to form the structured output We will now examine the methods we used to analyze the data For both domains the major obstacle to performing analysis of significant depth is the massive amount of data associated with the event In order for analysts to answer substantive questions they must be able to efficiently filter the data for the information pertinent to the question at hand To achieve this data filtering we used SPARQL.6 The benefit of SPARQL for our application is that it allows for the easy creation of what we referred to as N-th order queries that filter the data to preciously what we need in accordance with the ontology By N-th order queries we mean a SPARQL query that has multiple layers or orders of filtering that restrict the data This is best seen through an example For illustrative purpose we will again use the Boise St vs Oklahoma game Let's say an analyst was interested in finding out if Boise St had any big pass plays when they were deep in their own territory The occurrence of such plays would speak to Boise St.'s ability to use big plays to change the game as well as to provide some barometer for how conservative their play calling on offense was As such the analyst might develop a SPARQL query that has an equivalent English sentence of Give me all the completed passes thrown by Boise St where they were on their own 25 or less that went for 15 or more yards This particular query is a fifth-order query Explicitly the layers of filtering are 1 completed pass 2 Boise St 3 own side of the field 4 less than 25 yardline and 5 gained 15 or greater yards To answer the posed question such an occurrence occurred twice in the Boise St vs Oklahoma game The first was a 19 yard gain from Jared Zabransky to Legedu Naanee starting at the Boise St 17 at the beginning of the second quarter and the other was a 36 yard completion from Zabransky to Derek Schouman starting at the 22 yardline on the last drive of regulation The ability to perform such N-th order queries is absolutely critical to operations analysis in combat simulations A sample question an operations analyst might ask for in a scenario is Give me all the times a F-22 on a DCA mission was shot and killed at by a specific SAM type within a geographic region bounded by minimum and maximum latitudes and longitudes This is a ninth-order query where the layers are 1 shot fired 2 kill resulted 3 target of F-22 4 attacker of a specific SAM type such as SA-10 5 F-22 mission of DCA 6 shot location greater than minimum latitude 7 shot location less than maximum latitude 8 shot location greater than minimum longitude and 9 shot location less than a maximum longitude Given unstructured nature of the output data from most 8 6htro ii uerV 8  1 11 I_ 


simulations answering such questions previously required extensive datamining that could take at least hours if not days to perform and was highly susceptible to error However a SPARQL query could return the results in tenths of seconds for small data sets and minutes for very large datasets Plus if the parse is well formed and properly debugged there is no chance for errors either returning a false positive or an omission Another tremendous benefit received from the structuring of the data and querying it with SPARQL is the increased ease of debugging the definition of the scenario This is not necessarily a problem in football but it is a significant issue in combat simulation The very large scenarios blessed by the government to represent certain encounters of interest have thousands of platforms each individually created with unique properties As such even a low error rate yields a non-trivial amount of mistakes some of which could profoundly affect results Many man-hours are sunk into validating the details of a scenario such as the networks of the IADS or the command chain of platforms all of which is tedious Several well placed SPARQL queries can help greatly reduce the scenario debugging time and make the debugging less cumbersome in the process One of the lone downsides to employing the abovedescribed methodology for data mining and analysis in the combat simulation domain is the lack of familiarity of most analysts with these techniques While the learning curve is shallow schedule and mindset challenges limit most seasoned analysts ability to learn about Java RDF ontologies and SPARQL To help facilitate the creation of N-th order queries we developed a GUI to wrap around the code in the combat simulation domain The GUI was developed using NetBeans Matisse GUI developer and made creating N-th order queries simply a manner of selecting the desired options on the GUI As a result the analysts did not need to be Java programmers with extensive RDF knowledge in order to use the program Instead they simply needed to have knowledge of the domain which is already a prerequisite for performing the analysis 8 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The combat simulation domain is faced with the problem of having several different tools that represent data that is fundamentally the same in their own unique way The domain requires a method for combining disparate data into a common ontology as well as a way to then mine through the masses of data and filter out only that which is relevant to the current analysis In this paper we proposed a solution to this problem using RDF ontologies to commonly represent the domain and SPARQL queries to filter the results Due to the propriety classified nature of the work however we developed and presented a solution to a similar domain that being analyzing college football College football was chosen due to its similarities to the combat simulation domain which include 1 the output comes from a variety of sources represented in their own unique way but typically from ASCII text chronological log files 2 both domains contain ASCII lists of actors performing actions specific to the domain 3 both domains allow for a limited number of actions yet require tremendous ontological flexible within the actions and actors and 4 both domains require analysts to apply many-order filters to extract the desired in-depth information The bulk of the paper focused on the specifics of how the ontology was created how the ontology was combined with the data and finally the methods used in querying the data To these ends Stanford's Protege was used to create the ontology A Java program was then used to parse the data from input and output files after which the information was combined with the template ontology through the use of the Jena Semantic Web Framework or Jena The data were stored in an Oracle lOg database for permanent storage SPARQL was then used to query the data with a GUI assisting in this process The work yielded some significant conclusions SPARQL provided a simple methodology for creating the N-th order queries required by both domains Furthermore the execution of these queries provided access to data and answers to questions in seconds that required hours or days to get previously This drastic reduction in time and increase in the ease of use could literally transform the modem day combat simulation analyst from a glorified data miner back into an analyst Abstracting away the data mining and post-processing allows the analyst to focus on the forest instead of the type of bark on the trees in the forest Furthermore the unification of several sources into a common ontology allows for the analyst to be an expert in the entire domain not an expert in a specific tool Furthermore the encoding of the output into an ontology helps ensure the validity of the data and provides for additional scenario debugging assistance The validity of the data is augmented by the fact that the ontology eliminates all ambiguity in which entity is being used regardless of how it was referenced as well as any ambiguity in the definition of a certain event The assistance in debugging the scenario comes from the use of SPARQL queries on the input to the scenario such as verifying the members of a network in the IADS or the command chain of the platforms The SPARQL queries help provide quick access to the information and allow it to be displayed in a manner that is less cumbersome to crosscheck This allows for faster debugging of the input scenario

A filter lag or so-called cluster tracking can easily result in a 5% or greater offset and degraded consistency.  After 300 seconds the curves peak up because the target is appr oaching a low-elevation beampoint limit.  This occurs anytime a target is tracked into the edge of the radar\222s field of re gard and can lead to radar-toradar handover difficulty         300 300 80  s D 2 k,1 k y    s D 2 k,1 k y   100 150 200 250 10 1                    10 5 1 0  Figure 8 - Consistency versus distance from beam center Monopulse Mismatch The next set of curves plotted in Figure 9 show the sensitivity of detection-primitive consistency to a mismatch in the monopulse slope.  All of these curves were generated using a linear monopulse response derived from the slope of the true monopulse response at beam center.  The slope of the 80% curve is 0.8 times th e beam-center slope; the 90 curve is 0.9 times the beam-center slope; and so on for 100%, 110% and 120%.  Again, the order of curves in the graph is the same as the legend order A steep slope tends to expand y I 222s uncertainty while a gentle slope tends to compress it.  An expanded uncertainty leads to a smaller consistency while a compressed uncertainty leads to a larger consistency.  This behavior can be observed in the family of curves in Figure 9.  Curves for the steeper slopes are on the botto m while curves for more gentle slopes are on top.  The notable feature of this set of curves is that the sensitivity to a mismatch in the monopulse slope is not very significant       100 150 200 250 10 1                    90 100 110 120  Figure 9 - Consistency versus monopulse mismatch Range-Bias Error The complex nature of the monopulse radar models presents ample opportunity to introduce errors in the software implementation.  One such e rror introduced in a \275 rangecell-width bias in the detection-primitive range which in turn resulted in a significant degradation to 2 9 k D The fact that 2 9 k D is measured in different coordinates compared to the bias made it difficult to determine which value or algorithm was to blame.  Examining the intermediate consistency values led directly to the error source A comparison between biased 2 1 k D  2 2 k D and 2 3 k D values and unbiased 2 2 k D values is shown in Figure 10.  The unbiased 2 2 k D is the bottom-most curve and the biased 2 3 k D is the top-most curve with a value around 80.  This large value for 2 3 k D indicates that there is a lot more uncertainty in the range measur ements compared to what is predicted by the range varian ce.  Since the range-variance calculation is easy to confirm, the problem must be in the algorithms that model or manipulate range A notable feature of Figure 10 is the sensitivity of the centroiding algorithm to range bias in the detection primitives.  The range bias is ba rely noticeable in the biased 2 1 k D and 2 2 k D curves.  Of course, if the unbiased 2 2 k D  curve existed as a baseline it would be relatively easy to spot the error

As previously promised, the effects and corrections for atmospheric refr action and sensor bias have been disabled so that 2 8 k D can be analyzed using a sliding window.  Of course the full analysis would include these effects and 2 8 k D at each time step would be collected and averaged over many trials Plots of the effect of changing process noise in a nearlyconstant-velocity filter are shown in Figure 12 and Figure 13 for Cartesian position and velocity respectively.  In both figures, the plotted values have been divided by 3 so that the desired value is always 1.  Increasing the process noise up to a point should increase the updated uncertainty and reduce 2 8 k D values.  Except near th e end of the trajectory when the measurements are off of beam center, the curves in Figure 12 and Figure 13 appear inconclusive for this expected trend If 2 8 k D values are way out of range there are additional intermediate filter values that can be examined.

Analyzing covariance consistency is applicable to radar systems both in the field and in simulations.  The primary challenge in both arenas comes down to properly accounting for the true target states that contribute to detections, detection primitives measurements, and state estimates For a fielded radar syst em, achieving covariance consistency is usually a s econdary consideration behind achieving and maintaining track s.  Indeed, until recently radar specifications did not even include requirements for covariance consistency.  Recent covariance consistency requirements stem from the fact that the use of radar systems in sensor netting applications is on the rise Currently the combined e ffects of off-beam-center measurements, atmospheric correction, bias correction clustering and centrioding, data association, and filtering on state covariance consistency throughout a target\222s trajectory are not well known.  This is particularly true for radars using wideband waveforms and multiple hypotheses or multiple frame trackers.  Numerical results presented here indicate that algorithms early in the radar signal processing chain can significantly degrad e covariance consistency and that some errors are better tolerated than others For a simulated target in a modeled system, truth relative to some global reference is known. However, transforming truth through different refere nce frames and accounting for changes that occur during various radar processing algorithms is not as simple as it appears.  The techniques in this paper help expose this hidden complexity and provide a framework for discussing and expanding the future development of covariance consistency techniques.  Such future developments include issues related to mapping truth through the convolution operation typically used to simulate wideband signal processing and the fast Fourier transforms typically used in pulse-Doppler processing.  Sophisticated tracking algorithms that carry multiple hypotheses, associate across multiple frames, or weight the association of multiple targets within a single frame pose significant challenges in properly associating truth with state estimates.  Additional work, including an investigation of track-to-truth assignment, is needed before covariance consistency techniques can be applied to these algorithms Another area that needs furthe r analysis is the use of a sliding window to approximate the covariance behavior expected during a set of Monte-Carlo trials.  Various timedependent variables such as the target\222s range and orientation, the transmit waveform, the radar\222s antenna patterns toward the target, missed detections, and false alarms could easily viol ate the assumption that measurement conditions are nearly stationary over the time of the window.  It is importa nt to understand the conditions when this assumption is violated Finally, the examples presented here included a relatively benign arrangement of targets.  Further analysis in dense target environments with the related increase in merged detections, merged measurements, and impure tracks is needed.  Further analysis for targets traveling over different trajectories is also needed Even so, the techniques presented here can be extended to many of these analyses R EFERENCES  1  S. Blackman and R.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds.
