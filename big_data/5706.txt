ing model has demonstrated tremendous potential for both commercial and scientiìc users to access and deploy their applications anytime from anywhere at reasonable prices depending on their QoS speciìcations The computing power of the Cloud environment is supplied by a collection of data centers that are typically installed with hundreds to thousands of servers which are built on virtualized compute and storage technologies Meanwhile equally massive cooling systems are required to keep the servers within normal operating temperatures However these infrastructures consume tremendous amounts of energy The cost of servers running and cooling systems has increased by 400 over the past decade and such cost is expected to continue to 
rise F ollo wing the current usage and ef cienc y trends energy consumption by data centers could nearly double in another ve years to more than 100 billion kWh Besides the energy cost considerable amount of

emissions produced by these data centers signiìcantly contribute to the growing environmental issue of Global Warming Gartner estimated that the Information and Communication Technologies ICT industry generates about 2 of the total global emissions in 2007 Reducing ener gy consumption for modern data centers has been recognized as an ever increasingly important technique for operation 
cost environment footprint and system reliability Therefore we want to study the problem of supporting scientiìc applications modeled as DAG-structured workîows over the Cloud The dependency and parallelism embedded in a workîow requires that the tasks be dispatched to a group of distributed VMs in order to maximize the execution efìciency Also the Cloud resource availability map is time-dependent due to on-demand and reservation instances The startup idle and shutdown time of VMs compose the overhead of resource utilization The overhead could result in higher energy cost and resource underprovisioning which will inevitably hurt the application performance Therefore reducing the o v erhead to maximize 
resource utilization is always the Cloud providerês desire Motivated by the above-mentioned challenges and promises our paper proposes a resource provisioning and allocation scheme to strategically schedule the DAG-structured workîow onto the underlying time-dependent Cloud infrastructure The key contributions of this paper are 1 A realistic energy model based on various factors such as energy consumption energy cost and

II R ELATED W ORKS There are many research works addressing energyefìcient computation for either cluster servers or virtualized servers 6 7 T echnologies such as Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scheduling DVFS and Dynamic Power Management DPM were e xtensi v ely studied and widely deployed for energy savings Some limited research works 10 studied on the ener gy-ef cienc y issue from an economic cost perspective However most of previous works focused on energy reduction within a single server instead of across multiple data centers whereas Cloud providers typically have multiple geographically located data centers Furthermore most of these previous works focused on reducing energy usage not on the proìt boost while reducing the carbon emissions Recently a few research work began to take the environment sustainability issue such as emission into consideration Garg et al proposed energy-efìcient scheduling policies on determining the mapping order of application/data center pairs along with DVFS strategy to either minimize the emission or maximize Cloud provideês proìt However their work did not consider complex workîow structure which were commonly used by the scientiìc community and virtualization mechanism was not considered There are several commonly used task scheduling policies in Cloud computing management systems such as Eucalyptus and Pe g asus W orkîo w Manage System 13 However energy efìciency issue was not considered in these scheduling algorithms Our work differs from the aforementioned efforts in that we consider all of the following aspects i scientiìc workîow applications as opposed to individual tasks are considered under a time-dependent Cloud environment ii a bi-objective scheduling problem is formulated to meet both the QoS and energy reduction requirements iii DVFS based technology is applied to each task in the workîow to lower the CPU frequency without affecting the execution deadline iv multiple data centers are available for workîow scheduling III A NALYTICAL M ODELS There are basically ve main entities involved in our system architecture 1  Submit their service requests i.e workîow applications QoS requirements etc anytime from anywhere to the Cloud 2  Acts as an interface between the users and the Cloud infrastructure to enable energy efìcient Cloud services 3  Performs the actual scheduling of workîows Provides the Green Service Selector with Coefìcient Of Performance factor COP as the efìciency of the cooling system emission rate CPU powerfrequency relationship and electricity cost 4  Multiple independent VMs can be created and deployed on a single physical server 5  Each data center consists of multiple physical machines with limited OS data centers located at different places around the world The related parameters of a data center 002 002 are given in Tab I According to previous models 11 e x ecuting a workîow 004 at a data center 002 002 results the following 1 Energy consumption of CPU executing task  1 where is the frequency of CPU executing task  and is the execution time of task running on CPU at maximum frequency 2 Total Energy consumption 2 3 Energy cost 3 4 emission of data center 002 002 4 We construct the workîow scheduling model in Fig 1 to facilitate the scheduling problem A workîow is constructed as a Directed Acyclic Graph DAG where 006 is the number of tasks and 006 is the number of dependency edges We consider a general Cloud environment i.e a data center where 006 is the number of servers and 006 is the number of network links The resource cost of a workîow includes the task execution time and overhead for VM startup idle and shutdown time The total resource cost for server with allocated computing capacity 007 003\005\021 011 005\021 012 during time interval 002 is calculated by Eq 5 and the overhead cost is calculated by Eq 6 Utilization Rate UR stated in Eq 7 indicates the effective resource utilization of a workîow

5 6 7 IV P ROBLEM F ORMULATION AND A LGORITHM D ESIGN A Problem Formulation The scheduling problem is deìned as follows Deìnition 1 Assume that a Cloud provider has data centers at different geographical locations Each data center has different electricity cost emission rate and other energy related parameters Cloud users submit jobs i.e a single task pipeline or DAG-structured workîow to the Cloud with speciìed deadlines For a particular workîow submitted by a user our objective is to schedule the workîow to a chosen data center such that the energy cost and emission can be minimized for higher proìt and less environmental footprint while still satisfying deadline requirement B Algorithm Design A ve-step workîow scheduling algorithm namely Energy-Aware Resource Efìcient workîow Scheduling under Deadline constraint EARESD  is proposed The complexity of this algorithm is  Step 1 Earliest Completion Time Estimation Phase  For all data centers calculate the estimated earliest completion time   for a workîow by assuming that all CPUs in each data center run at their maximum frequencies without considering actual VM allocation Step 2 DVFS Phase  Use DVFS technology to reduce energy consumption by scaling down the CPU frequency under the deadline constraint and the optimal frequency for executing each task is also determined Step 3 Data Center Selection Phase  For each available data center that satisìes the deadline requirement choose the best data center based on workîow completion time energy cost and emission   Step 4 Forward Workîow Scheduling Phase  A layerbased forward task scheduling is performed to the selected data center and tasks are scheduled from the rst layer to the last layer Earliest completion time is calculated Each task is scheduled on a speciìc VM running at the desired frequency as calculated by Step 2 Go back to Step 3 to pick another data center if exceeds the deadline constraint Step 3-4 is repeated until we nd a data center that satisìes the deadline constraint or reject the user request Step 5 Backward Workîow Scheduling Phase  Based on the temporary mapping result from Step 4 the resource utilization rate UR is further improved by reusing VM and shrinking the idle time between tasks In this step a backward scheduling strategy is conducted to adjust the task mapping from the last layer to the rst layer while the minimum and deadline is still guaranteed V E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS A Experimental Setup We use open source Java-based CloudSim toolkit to model our green Cloud infrastructure and evaluate our scheduling algorithm Many Java classes have been adapted to accommodate our workîow application structure as well as the time-dependent Cloud resources 1 Data Center Conìguration We model 8 different data centers with different conìgurations with data center ID from 1 to 8 CPU power factors of different data centers are derived from Wang and Luês work 11 As current commercial CPUs only support discrete frequency levels we consider discrete CPU frequencies in the range of   W e assume that the COP v alue of each data center is 1.5 VM startup time is 100 seconds and the shutdown time is 8 seconds based on 2 Workîow Conìguration We experiment with 10 different sizes of workîows with workîow ID from 1 to 10 represented by a two-tuple   10 21 20 35 40 88 60 119 80 158 100 212 200 398 300 601 400 784 500 1024 B Analysis of Results Performance metrics of energy consumption energy cost and emission are used to examine the effect of the three phases For each metric we compare the following phases of our algorithm earliest completion time estimation   DVFS   forward workîow scheduling   and backward workîow scheduling   On the left side of Fig 2 the energy consumption decreases by up to 40 from to due to
