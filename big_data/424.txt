X-O838 Japan Abstract  There m many scheduling strategies called dispatching rules for man systems However those rules can be applied mainly to simple manufaankg systems In this paper we propose a way to evaluate the effectiveness of such dispatching rules in the enviraunent 
of complex manufaawing systems in the sense that there exist two performance measures Defining a new conce~t of closeness of dkptdhg ruls with mpect to a performance measurp we can find a set ofclose dispatching rules fortheperfamance meame This will give 
us some guidance about which dispatching rules may apply at each dispatching point in a manufaan system under two or more performance measu~ps in prauice Forthepurpme a bxhniqw of data mining plays an important role 1 Introduction Many dispatching rules are defived for

have the same setup as in 26 but the pro\223t follows lognormal distribution The result is shown in Figure 2 In the 223gure it is noted that the pro\223tability lines for MPIS Alg QP and HAP are overlapping and the execution-time line for HAP is slightly greater than that for naive For pro\223tability we observe that for the data set the naive approach gives the lowest pro\223tability among all algorithms This is because the naive approach does not consider any cross-selling effect Naturally the pro\223tabilities of all algorithms increase when the number of items selected increases From the graph of the execution time against the selection size the execution time of MPIS Alg increases from 0 selection reaching a maximum when about half the items are selected and then decreases afterwards Here the execution time depends on two factors The 223rst factor is related to the complexity of each iteration If there are more items to be selected the bene\223t calculation is more complex and updates to the bene\223t are more likely The initial increase is related to the 223rst factor The second factor is related to the number of iterations in the algorithm When 000  the number of items selected increases the number of items to be removed in the iteration step decreases Thus the number of iterations decreases if 000 is large compared with 001  The 223rst factor is dominant when the selection is below 50 but the second factor becomes dominant when the selection is larger than 50 The quadratic programming approach QP used in the chosen Solver uses a variant of the Simplex method to determine a easible region and then uses the methods described in 13 to 223nd the solution As the approach uses an iterative step based on e current state to determine the next step the execution time is quite 224uctuating as the execution time is mainly dependent on the problem or which state the algorithm is in HAP is an iterative approach to 223nd the authority weight of each item The formula for the update of the authority weight is in the form 002 000 003\002 where 002 is a vector of dimension 001 representing the authority weight of 001 items and 003 is an 001 000 001 matrix used in HAP to update the authority weight In our experiment we observed that the authority weights converge rapidly QP takes the longest execution time compared with other algorithms Naive gives the shortest execution time as there are only simple operations HAP gives the second shortest execution time for this small synthetic data set We note that the number of iterations involved are quite small MPIS Alg has the second greatest execution time but it scales much better with increasing number of items where it can outform HAP many folds see the next subsection 7.4 Results r Real Data Set With the drug store data set we have conducted similar experiments as with the synthetic data However the Quadratic Programming QP Solver 1 does not handl e m ore t han 2000 variables In the real data set there are 26,128 variables i.e items hence it is not possible to experiment with our QP tool The results of the experiments are shown in Figure 3 In the results HAP gives the lowest pro\223tability The reason is as follows In the dataset there are some items with zero-pro\223t and high authority weight described in Section 3 yielding a low estimated total pro\223t of the item selection Suppose item 004 000 has zero pro\223t it is likely a good buy and hence can lead to high support If there are suf\223cient number of purchases of other item says item 004 001  with item 004 000 and if item 004 000 usually occur in e transactions containing item 004 001  the con\223dence of the rule 004 001 001 004 000 is quite high This creates a high authority weight for item 004 000  Items like 004 000 would lead to smaller profitability for HAP MPIS Alg gives a greater pro\223tability than naive approach in the real data set For instance if 000 000\001\002 005 003\002\001  the difference in pro\223tabilities between these two approaches is 2 In the real data set the l pro\223t is equal to 1,006,970 The difference in 2 pro\223tability corresponds to 20,139.4 which is a signi\223cant value If J=8709 the difference in pro\223tabilities between the two approaches is about 8 which corresponds to 80,557.6 On average the execution time of HAP is 6.5 times slower than MPIS Alg when the problem size is large HAP requires 6 days to 223nd the item selection while MPIS Alg requires about 1 day to 223nd the solution Since item selection is typically performed once in a while only when a store should update the types of products it carries the execution time is acceptable Though the naive method is much faster the pro\223t gain consideration from MPIS Alg would make it the better choice for an application The execution time of HAP increases signi\223cantly when the number of items increases compared with MPIS Alg In HAP a cross-selling matrix 006 is updated iteratively The matrix is of the order 001 000 001  For the real data set 001 000 001\004 005 005\001\006 and 001 000 will be very large Let 002 be e 001 000 005 vector representing the authority weight of each item In HAP there is a process to update 003\002 iteratively where 003 000 006 002 006 Thismatrix multiplication of matrix 003 with vector 002 is highly costly Let us consider the memory required for matrix 003  If double data type 8 bytes is used for storage of each entry then the matrix requires a memory size of about 5.08GB If 224oat data type 4 bytes is required then about 2.5GB memory is required This large matrix cannot 223t into the physical memory g a t of disk accesses for virtual memory Since the matrix 003 is sparse a hash data structure can be used so that only non-zero entries are stored We have adopted the hash structure for the real data set and fouud that less than 5MB memory is needed Our results in Figure 3 are based on this enhanced hashing approach However the computatio n with this reduced size is still very massive We have also tried other sets of experiments where not all Proceedings of the Third IEEE Internati onal Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM\22203

the items are considered but only those above a minimum support threshold of 0.05 or 0.1 are considered However the resulting pro\223tabilities are much lower than those shown in Figure 3 For instance if J  500 and min-support  0.05 the pro\223tability of naive and MPIS Alg is about 1.3 But if all items are considered the pro\223tability of those approaches is about 25 This is explained by the existence of items that generate h pro\223ts but which are not purchased frequently enough to be counted given the support thresholds  Na ve i Na ve i Figure 2 The Synthetic Data Set Na ve i Na ve i Figure 3 The drug store data set 8 Conclusion One of the applications of association rule the maximalpro\223t item selection problem with cross-selling effect MPIS is discussed in this paper We propose a modeling by the loss rule which is used in the formulation of the total pro\223t of the item selection We propose both a quadratic programming approach and a heuristical approach to solve the MPIS problem We show by experiments that these methods are ef\223cient and highly effective We believe that much future work can be done The heuristical method can be enhanced with known methodologies such as hill climbing Expert knowledge can be included in the methods and the de\223nition of the problem can be changed in different ways to re\224ect different user environments
