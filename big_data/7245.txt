computationally intensive An exhaustive search where every possible candidate is taken into consideration is not practical for larger pattern widths due to exponential computational complexity Other approaches apply heuristics where algorithm tries to reduce search space but may compromise the accuracy of results to certain extent We used modi\002ed Apriori algorithm to mine possible patterns in a very long sequence especially most frequent substring pattern of a 002xed length in biological sequence The algorithm gives good performance by rapid reduction in search space and computations using bit-wise operations instead of expensive string comparison operations This algorithm outperform existing pattern 002nding methods such as MEME in terms of execution time Keywords 227 Most Frequent Pattern Apriori Genomic Sequences I I NTRODUCTION Pattern matching problem has been extensively studied due to its wide applications and numerous algorithms have been developed The practical applications of pattern matching especially string matching ranges from word processors information retrieval to bio-informatics and many others The matching problem are of two types-exact and inexact string matching The exact string matching searches for presence of a given string in another one while inexact allows some tolerance in matching Let X be a string of length m and Y be a string of length n the simple and direct method to search for Y on X will have a time complexity of O\(mxn Since the sub string Y can be start at any location from the 002rst to  m 000 n  1 th position of X each comparison requires a maximum of n comparisons total number of comparison is up to n  m  n 000 1  Knuth-Morris-Prat algorithm and BoyerMoore algorithm reduces the number of comparisons to O\(m+n by introducing pre-processing steps such as rightto-left scan  Bad character rule and Good suf\002x rule  Another break through in the area is algorithms with suf\002x tree A suf\002x tree represent internal structure of any given string For given string X of length m the suf\002x tree consists of exactly m leaf nodes Once tree has been constructed any arbitrary string Y of length n can be matched O\(n time Though the naive method for construction of suf\002x require O  m 2  time Esko Ukkonen developed an algorithm for tree construction in linear Another dif\002culty is space requirement which is impractical for very long strings as even most ef\002cient representation a rank selection operation requires m log 2 m  O  m  bits  Abhilash Srikantha and Ajith S Bopardikar de v eloped an algorithm for fast exact sequence search on large DNA sequence by making use of hash tables and In the case of inexact string matching strict one to one match between the alphabets is not intended In this context the word sequence is more appropriate than string  When two sequences are compared the measure of their similarity can be determined in terms of the number of identical symbols in them Such a sub-sequence present in both sequences are called common sequence A Longest Common Sequence\(LCS is sequence which is having maximum length The string matching dimension is exploded when it is required to 002nd all occurrences of unknown patterns in a given set of strings In given input of length N 002nding all pattern exist in it is a NP-hard P attern disco v ery is a fundamental problem in bio-informatics Repeated patterns of small and large sequences are common in biological sequences Some authors suggest that these patters are deciding factors in structural and functional properties of  There are man y types of repeats such as Short Sequence Repeats\(SSR Palindrome Repeats Tandem Repeats and Highly Periodic 8 T andem Repeats are adjacent patterns of two or more nucleotides in a DNA sequence For example the pattern A-T-T-C-G is repeated twice in A-T-T-C-G-A-T-T-C-G SSR are also called micro satellites When exactly two nucleotides are repeated it is called dimers and when three four 002ve and six nucleotide repeats are called trimers tetramers pentamers and hexamers respectively When 10-60 nucleotides are repeated it is called mini satellites II R ELATED W ORKS The term motif is generally is used to describe a short pattern that is found in upstream of transcription sites of genes and are responsible for gene re Motifs belong to the inexact string matching category since strict pattern adherence is not mandatory The motif discovery algorithms belongs to three different categoriesEnumeration  Deterministic Optimization and Probabilistic Optimization  First one is a exhaustive search which enumerates all possible patterns but algorithm is suitable only for short patterns as its computational complexity is exponential Timothy L Bailey

and Charles Elkan developed an algorithm named MEME to identify motifs in unaligned 11 MEME works on the principle of Expectation Maximization 12 Expectation Maximization EM aligns a set of sequences without knowing the starting position of possible motif By initial assumption of a motif it 002nd out the probability estimate of a motif that starts at position j in sequence i  Then re-estimates the probability that a symbol l appear in column c of the motif This process of estimation and re-estimation continues until convergence is possible MEME is extension of EM where EM is applied only once from starting point derived from the a given subsequence choose a model of shared motif with highest likely hood and then run EM until its convergence AlignACE is algorithm based on Gibbs sampling developed by Roth and AlignA CE uses MAP\(Maximum apriori log likelihood score as a measure of comparison between expected random occurrence and actual degree of presentation of a motif is a recent tool capable of accessing existing motif discovery tools like MEME BioProspector[16 AlignA CE and other tools It provides facility for analysis and visual representation of identi\002ed motifs Wenyuan discusses an algorithm which 002nds frequent sub-graphs for identifying most frequent patterns from biological networks such as protein-protein interaction gene functions Association rules 002nd relationship between a set of data  These relationships are not generally inherent in data thus the algorithm has been employed for data mining especially 002nding frequent patterns in transaction databases and similar applications In biological data analysis these rules were applied to 002nd the association between different genes and gene expression A kno wn Association rule algorithm is Apriori algorithm generate candidates itemsets of a 002xed size and scan a database to see whether it is frequent Let C i denotes candidate item-set in scan i and L i denotes set of large most frequent items during the scan i then only items in L i  which is a subset of C i  are used to generate candidate itemset C i 1  for the next database scan This is based on the principle of Item-set Property which says any subset of large item-set must be large  Thus if we know an item-set is small we need not generate any super set of it as candidates because they must also be small However this algorithm has serious drawbacks as it requires potentially large number of database scan So the algorithm assumes that the database is memory resident which in turn limits the size of database This paper proposes a novel algorithm for identifying most repeated substring from a biological databases III M OST F REQUENT P ATTERN G ENERATOR We used a technique that combines Apriori and Partitioning algorithm to 002nd most repeated substrings of any desired size from a set of biological sequences The biological sequences could be RNA DNA or Protein sequences Our attempt is to improve performance of algorithms in two ways one end by utilizing computationally less intensive operations instead of string comparison and on other hand by drastic reduction in search space as the algorithm progresses Fig 1 Candidate Set Generation The algorithm works as follows At 002rst the biological sequence for example a DNA sequence is translated to binary sequence by substituting A with 00 C with 01 G with 10 and T with 11 The iterative search begin with single nucleotide sequence monomers A C G and T  then proceed with larger sequences using Algorithm 2 BioApriori algorithm In each iteration sub-sequences with lesser support are eliminated Reason for elimination is that sequence cannot be frequent unless a subset is frequent Let L i is set of most frequent substrings of level i then candidate set for next iteration is generated by a Algorithm 3 BioSeqGen algorithm All combinations substrings in L i are taken into consideration even a string with itself Assume S 1 and S 2 are two strings of size i Then candidate substrings of size i  1 is generated if right most  i 000 1 003 2 bits of substring S 1 is same as left most  i 000 1 003 2 bits of second string S 2  if so S 1 and S 2 are combined to form a new candidate Figure 1 illustrates working of algorithm with an example The BioApriori algorithm in its 002rst iteration counts the strings A C G and T Assume all four strings have suf\002cient support in order to participate generation of candidates in level 2 The BioSeqGen algorithm takes all combinations of A C G and T without any constraints as length of sub-string is just one The candidate set is AA AC AG AT CA CC CG CT GA GC GG GT TA TC TG TT Assume that only a subset AA AG CG GC GT TA and TG are having suf\002cient support The value for support is 002xed based on the output requirement So the combinations of these sub-strings are applied to generate next level candidate item In level 3 AA and AG combined to generate new candidate AAG since they a common string A left and right AG and AA extracted AAA is included in the new candidate set since AA can be combined to itself Therefore candidate sets of size 3 are AAA AAG AGC AGT CGC CGT GCG GTA GTG TAA TAG TGC TGT and assume that a substring having suf\002cient support are AAA AAG AGT CGC GCG GTG TGC The combinations for these sustrings with a match two symbols produce candidate substrings of size 4 So GCG combined with CGC could form the candidates GCGC and CGCG Finally AGTGC and CGCGC are found as common sequences repeated in the given genomic sequence Algorithm 1 2013 IEEE Internat\ional

1 when passing through each 002 i 005C Y  The operation prune 002 q  removes all the patterns dominated by 002 from the candidate set C Y  whose dependent quality Q 002 k  is less than or equal to q  For example in Line 7 prune 002 i  V max C 002 i   removes patterns 002 in S 1 from C Y  according to Proposition 2 Note that any 002 k is dominated by 002 0  002 0  Y  002 002 k  Y  where 002 0 has 002 0  A  d max for each attribute A 005 Y  Therefore in Line 6 we can also use the same function prune 002 0 V max  to prune the set S 0  according to Proposition 1 Finally we discuss the processing orders of candidates in C Y  Heuristically in order to maximize the pruning power we would like to nd the largest V max as early as possible As illustrated in Figure 1 if we rst process patterns in the top the corresponding dependent quality is small  013 0  which leads to a small V max  indicating weak pruning power On the other hand when the patterns in the bottom are processed rst the corresponding V max is also small due to the low condence  013 0  Therefore during the processing we heuristically choose the patterns in the middle to be processed rst namely midrst order in C Y  Algorithm 2 for Dependent Attributes with Pruning PAP  M 002  X  V max  1 for each 002 i  Y  005C Y do 2 let 002 i  X  002  X  3 compute C 002 i  from M 4 if C 002 i  002 i  V max then 5 002 max  002 i V max C 002 i  002 i  6 prune 002 0 V max   remove patterns in S 0 from C Y  7 prune 002 i  V max C 002 i    remove patterns in S 1 from C Y  8 return 002 max B Determination for Determinant Attributes Next we consider all possible distance threshold patterns of the determinant attributes X say C X andnda 002 with the maximum  U 002   The straight-forward approach is to compute the best 002  Y  for each 002  X  005C X respectively by using PA  and then return the one with the maximum  U 002   Algorithm 3 presents the straight-forward computation of a distance threshold 002 max with the maximum expected utility For each 002 i  X  005C X  Line 3 computes D 002 i  from M by using formula 1 By calling the PA or PAP algorithm we can compute the best 002 i  Y  with respect to the current 002 i  X   For the initial bound V max  as mentioned before we can set V max 0 as illustrated in Line 4 Finally the expected utility  U 002 i  of each 002 i in Line 5 is computed by using formula 5 as presented in Section IV Here U max records the maximum expected utility in the rst i  1 candidates U max  i  1 max j 1  U 002 j   Initially we set U max 0  The returned 002 max is the distance threshold pattern with the maximum expected utility U max  Algorithm 3 for Determinant Attributes DA  M  1 U max 0 2 for each 002 i  X  005C X do 3 compute D 002 i  from M 4 compute 002 i  Y  by PA  M 002 i  X   0  5  U 002 i  E U 002 i   C 002 i   D 002 i   Q 002 i  6 if U max   U 002 i  then 7 002 max  002 i U max   U 002 i  8 return 002 max Again considering all d distance threshold values in each attribute there are d  X  and d  Y  candidates in set C X and C Y respectively Let c   X    Y  be the total number of attributes in X and Y  The total number of candidates evaluated in the algorithm is C X C Y   d c  Note that for each candidate we have to traverse the matching relation M in order to compute corresponding measures such as condence Therefore the entire complexity of the approaches e.g DA  PA is O  Md c   where M is the total number of matching tuples in M Note that pruning version PAP can be applied to replace the basic approach PA  namely DA  PAP

Advanced pruning bound using 002 max  The most costly part of the above DA algorithm is still the computation of 002 i  Y  by using PA or PAP  which traverses M frequently As mentioned in order to improve the pruning power of PAP we expect to nd a larger pruning bound V max  Lets rst study the following properties in terms of the expected utility Theorem 3 Consider any two 002 1 002 2  having D 002 1  012 D 002 2   If their condence and dependent quality satisfy C 002 2  002 2  003 1  D 002 1  D 002 2  007 1  C 002 1  002 1  010 then we have  U 002 1  012  U 002 2   Intuitively we can prune those 002 2 whose C 002 2  002 2  is no higher than 1  D 002 1  D 002 2  007 1  C 002 1  002 1  010  i.e the new pruning bound V max  To apply this pruning bound we require a precondition D 002 1  012 D 002 2   Therefore we can adopt an ordering of candidates in C X having D 002 i 1  012 D 002 i 2  for any i 1 i 2  The ordering can be done in linear time by amortizing the D 002  values into a constant domain In the following algorithms we assume that the candidates in C X have already been listed in descending order of D 002  values Let 002 max be the current result with the maximum expected utility by evaluating the rst i  1 candidates in C X Sincewe process C X in descending order of D 002  values for the next 002 i wehave D 002 max  012 D 002 i   According to Theorem 3 we can compute an advanced pruning bound V max 1  D 002 max  D 002 i  007 1  C 002 max  002 max  010 6 for the computation of 002 i  Y  by using PAP  in the current 002 i  Algorithm 4 extends Algorithm 3 by introducing the advanced pruning bound V max instead of simply assigning V max 0 in the original DA  We compute the advanced pruning bound in Line 4 by using formula 6 and use this V max for pruning in the determination on dependent attributes Y Line 5 Note that all candidates in C Y might be pruned in PAP by the advanced V max  i.e no 002 i  Y  returned Line 6 Then the current 002 i  X  can be discarded safely without computing the corresponding  U 002 i   Algorithm 4 for Determinant Attributes with Pruning DAP  M  1 U max 0 2 for each 002 i  X  005C X do 3 compute D 002 i  from M 4 V max 1  D 002 max  D 002 i  007 1  C 002 max  002 max  010 5 compute 002 i  Y  by PAP  M 002 i  X  V max  6 if 002 i  Y  exists then 7  U 002 i  E U 002 i   C 002 i   D 002 i   Q 002 i  8 if U max   U 002 i  then 9 002 max  002 i U max   U 002 i  10 return 002 max Recall that when the advanced pruning bound is not available i.e V max 0 initially in DA  PAP weuseamid-rst order to process candidates in C Y in order to nd a large V max as early as possible However we now already calculate an advanced pruning bound V max  0 in DAP  Heuristically in order to prune more candidates we would like to process those ones in C Y which can dominate more candidates according to the prune operator in PAP  For example we can use a top-rst order which rst processes candidates in the top since the top candidates e.g  9  9  in Figure 1 a always dominate the bottom ones Therefore in the DAP  PAP approach with advanced pruning bounds the top-rst processing order of candidates in C Y is preferred to achieve better time performance which is also veried by our experiment results in Table V If the calculated bound V max is less than 0 we can simply assign 0 to it Once the bound is V max  0  it can achieve a tighter pruning bound Therefore practically  the worst case of DAP is exactly the basic DA algorithm In fact as we can nd Theorem 2 is a special case of Theorem 3 when D 002 1  002 2  Inotherwords theoretically  the advanced pruning e.g DAP  PAP  developed based on Theorem 3 is a generalization of the basic pruning DA  PAP based on Theorem 2 Our experiments in Section VI also verify that DAP  PAP is at least no worse than DA  PAP  Algorithm Extensions When users require more than one answer for specic applications the proposed algorithms can be easily extended to nd the distance threshold patterns with second or third or l th largest expected utilities Specically instead of the maximum C 002  002  weuse V max to denote the l th maximum C 002  002  in Algorithms 1 2 and so on Then the return results are a set of l patterns of distance thresholds with the largest expected utilities Since we relax V max from the 1st maximum to l th maximum the pruning power will be weaker with the increase of l  We report the time performance on different answer sizes l in the experiments VI E XPERIMENTAL E VA L UAT I O N We now report the experimental evaluation of the proposed methods All the

improvement is only about 1500 from 5500 to 4000 in Figure 6 Nevertheless DAP  PAP can still keep the lowest time cost in all the test in Figure 6 VII C ONCLUSIONS Motivated by the utility of differential dependencies  DD s in real applications like violation detection in this paper we study the problem of determining the distance thresholds for metric distance constraints from data Instead of manually specifying requirements of various statistical measures we conduct the determination in a parameter-free style i.e to compute an expected utility of the distance threshold pattern and return the results with the maximum expected utility Several advanced pruning algorithms are then developed in order to efciently nd the desired distance thresholds Finally the experimental evaluation on three real data sets demonstrates the performance of our proposed methods In particular we evaluate the effectiveness of returned results in the violation detection application and show that the pruning techniques can achieve lower time cost A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No 611411 National Grand Fundamental

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresby PCA, number of records by FP-Growth By experiments, found the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
