Introduction to Multi-Criteria Decision Support Minitrack  
almost never exists, and a satisfactory compromise solution is generally sought. Multi-criteria decisionmaking as a field of research deals with problem theory and solution approaches directly involving multiple decision criteria. Information technology and systems may help in dealing with such multicriteria decision problems. This mini-track focuses on solution approaches, technology, and systems that support decision-making under consideration of multiple decision criteria  This is the third time that this minitrack is 
included in the HICSS program, and five contributed papers have been accepted. The papers deal with a wide range of decision problems, from software component selection, to recommendations for location-based services. Furthermore, the relevance of trust in multi-criteria decision support, support for research proposal grouping, and skyline operation for multi-criteria decision support are investigated and discussed  Becker, Kraxner, Plangg, and Rauber, in their paper on

However in practice it is almost impossible to obtain a model that exactly matches the process behavior because there is mismatch between the behavior of the model and the plant. In practice, fault diagnosis based on fuzzy models may have advantages, since models of th is type only attempt to capture the essential features of the behavior and can take more realistic account of the uncertainties and imprecision associated with characteristics Fuzzy modeling was originally proposed by Zadeh. A fuzzy diagnosis model consists of a set of production rules which define the relationship between the characteristics and failures. The generation of a fuzzy model can be divided into structure identification and parameter estimation. Structure identification is concerned with selecting the relevant input and output variables and choosing the most appropriate form for the relationships between the variables. Parameter estimation, often called fuzzy identification, involves estimating values for the p arameters which define the membership functions of the fuzzy sets, and/or the elements of a fuzzy relational array The fuzzy sets x1; x2; \205; xm uniformly partition the input space, and may be interpreted qualitatively as values in the range 0 to 1.0. Fuzzy characteristics vector is The fuzzy sets y1; y2; \205; yn uniformly partition the output space, and may be interpreted qualitatively as values in the range 0 to 1.0. Fuzzy failures vector is The relationship between X and Y is . R is the elements of a fuzzy relational array, and   associ ate   and . R is given by Accuracy of fuzzy diagnosis is based on the building of fuzzy relational matrix which indicates the relationships between characteristics and failures. R is the elements of  a With fuzzy diagnosis theory a fault diagnosis model of high voltage SF6 circuit breaker is presented in this paper And by analyzing the frequent and common failures, this paper confirms the items of online monitoring of HVCB Moreover, it digs the relati onship between the characteristic parameters and the failures. From the result of failures statistics and the analysis on the important signals of HVCB\222s operation, this paper defines the failures array, failure symptoms array and fuzzy relational matrix. Then, it gives the optimistic fuzzy operator and diagnosis rules Coils of Mechanism Voltage Current Indicates the condition of the coil itself and the condition of the latches, mechanical in operating mechanism Frequent and common failures in operation are shown in Tab.3 Coil of Motor Voltage Current Monitors the condition of motor Reflects the integrity of sealed mechanism 003\004 Fuzzy characteristics and its\222 matching function are shown in Tab.4 Matching function has three types that are upper limit function, lower limit function and anti-trapezia function Curves and formulas of three functions are shown in Fig.1 Fig.2 and Fig3 D FAILURES ARRAY C MODAL OF HVCB FUZZY FAULT DIAGNOSIS 005 006\006 007\b t\n t\n t\n t\n 013\f 002 002 003\003\004\003 002 F OPIMISTIC FUZZY OPERATOR AND DIAGNOSIS RULES Contact Temperature Three Phase Current Temperature Rising Calculates the life of HVCB Reflects the installation of dynamic and static contact 63 kV and above showed in Table 1.

We have explored the realm of greedy algorithms to obtain approximately optimal solutions The general idea is that starting with a set of transactions T and a set of candidates C  we want to obtain a set S  C  such that every transaction in T is covered by some member of S  One greedy way to approach this problem is to allow every transaction to select a best candidate for itself and add it to the summary  top-down  Similar transactions will tend to select the same candidate and hence it would result in compaction gain Another approach is to incrementally increase the compaction of a summary by adding a best candidate from the candidate set at every step  bottom-up  We have investigated both approaches in our research b u t in this paper we discuss only the bottom-up algorithm due to space limitations 5.1 BUS A Bottom-up Summarization Algorithm In this section we present an incremental bottom-up algorithm BUS  The main idea behind this algorithm is to incrementally select best candidates from the candidate set such that at each step for a certain gain in compaction minimum information loss is incurred The inputs to this algorithm are the set of transactions T  the set of candidates C  the initial value k init s of the tradeoff parameter k s and the increment  k for k s  Before describing the algorithm we rst dene the scoring function which we use to determine the best candidate DEFINITION 5  Score of a Candidate Summary ora given candidate summary C i  C  its score is given by score i  k s  size C i  loss C i size C i refers to the compaction and loss C i refers to the information loss caused by adding C i to the summary k s is a trade-off parameter which determines which entity to favor  higher compaction gain or lower information loss A low value of k s favors very specic candidate summaries which result in lower information loss while a higher value for k s favors more general candidate summaries which cause a higher compaction gain DEFINITION 6  Size of a Candidate izeofacandidate C i  C isdenedas size C i   individual summaries in S c  the current summary which are covered 2 by C i  Let the individual summaries in S c covered by C i be  S 1 S 2 S size C i   Note that each of these individual summaries can be either transactions or candidates 2 An individual summary is covered by C i if it is more specic than C i DEFINITION 7  Loss for a Candidate  Loss for candidate C i is dened as loss C i   size C i j 1  l C i  l S j  where l Candidate   f k 1 W k  b k  such that b k 1if F k   Candidate and 0 otherwise The algorithm starts by considering the initial summary as the set of transactions T  which has no information loss but no compaction gain Denitions 6 and 7 are used to compute the score for each candidate in C using Denition 5 The candidate with the highest score is selected and added to the current summary S c  replacing all summaries that are covered by it If the candidate with maximum score has already been added to the summary the value of k s is incremented by  k  The size of each of the candidates is revised equal to the number of individual summaries in S c covered by that candidate From the ICC curve perspective the algorithm moves from no compaction gain to higher compaction gain in small steps determined by the value k s  The initial value for k s is chosen as 0 This ensures that initially candidates with minimum information loss are selected These will tend to be very specic and hence the overall compaction gain will be low After all such candidates are chosen the value of k s is incremented by  k so that more general candidates with larger sizes are selected The selection criterion of this algorithm ensures that the increment in the compaction of the global summary at any step incurs the minimum possible information loss Thus this algorithm ensures that we attain a locally optimal solution at any step Starting with a very low value of k s and incrementing it in very small amounts ensures that the summary obtained at any step is also very close to the globally optimal solution for that particular compaction The rst step of BUS involves generation of frequent itemsets from the data using any association rule mining algorithm The categorical attributes are binarized before applying the algorithm The computational complexity of this step depends on the size and nature of the data It can be controlled using the support threshold At the University of Minnesota the summarization module of MINDS takes less than 10 seconds to generate frequent itemsets for the top 5000 anomalous connections with a support threshold of 8 transactions By using closed frequent itemsets the number of frequent itemsets can be pruned considerably In the second step of BUS in each iteration the algorithm selects the best candidate to be added to the current summary The size of the current summary cannot be more than the total number of transactions Thus if the transaction dataset is of of size m  the candidate set is of size l and the algorithm runs for k iterations the computational complexity of the second step will be O  mlk   In our experiments as discussed in Section 6 we ran BUS to generate summaries of sizes ranging from the size of the data itself down to 5 The Proceedings of the Fifth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM05 1550-4786/05

obtained for DARPA dataset using BUS algorithm Information Loss=18601.7 ipsweep attack which is essentially a single external machine scanning a lot of internal machines on different ports is summarized in S 6  S 5 summarizes the connections which correspond to internal machines which replied to this scanner The real advantage of this scheme can be seen if we observe summary S 9 which is essentially a single transaction In the data this is the only connection between these two machines and corresponds to the rootkit attack The BUS algorithm preserves this outlier even for such a small summary because there is no other pattern which covers it without losing too much information Similarly S 10 represents 5 transactions which are icmp replies to an external scanner by 5 internal machines Note that these replies were not merged with the summary S 5 but were represented as such Thus we see that summaries generated by BUS algorithm represent the frequent as well as infrequent patterns in the data 7 Concluding Remarks and Future Work The two schemes presented for summarizing transaction datasets with categorical attributes demonstrated their effectiveness in the context of network trafc analysis A variant of our proposed two-step approach is used routinely at the University of Minnesota as a part of the MINDS system to summarize several thousand anomalous netows into just a few dozen summaries This enables the analyst to visualize the suspicious trafc in a concise manner and often leads to the identication of attacks and other undesirable behavior that cannot be captured using widely used intrusion detection tools such as SNORT Future work involves using clusters along with frequent itemsets as candidates for the BUS algorithm Another possibility is to incorporate the knowledge of the anomaly scores of the network connections to be summarized as well as normal behavior to generate summaries which capture the anomalous behavior of the highly ranked transactions in a ranked dataset Acknowledgements The authors thank Gaurav Pandey and Shyam Boriah for their extensive comments on an earlier draft of the paper This work was supported by Army High

dress a related problem In the problem is to monitor continuously changing numerical values which could represent frequency counts in a distributed setting The objective is to maintain a list of the top k aggregated values where each aggregated value represents the sum of a set of individual values each of which is stored on a different node The work of assumes a single-le v e l communication topology and does not consider how to manage synopsis precision in hierarchical communication structures using in-network aggregation which is the main focus of this paper The work most closely related to ours is the recent work of Greenwald and Khanna which addresses the problem of computing approximate quantiles in a general communication topology Their technique can be used to nd frequencies of frequent items to within a congurable error tolerance The work in focuses on providing an asymptotic bound on the maximum load on any link our result adheres to the same asymptotic bound It does not however address how best to congure a precision gradient in order to minimize load which is the particular focus of our work 5 Summary In this paper we studied the problem of nding frequent items in the union of multiple distributed streams The central issue is how best to manage the degree of approximation performed as partial synopses from multiple nodes are combined We characterized this process for hierarchical communication topologies in terms of a precision gradient followed by synopses as they are passed from leaves to the root and combined incrementally We studied the problem of nding the optimal precision gradient under two alternative and incompatible optimization objectives 1 minimizing load on the central node to which answers are delivered and 2 minimizing worst-case load on any communication link We then introduced a heuristic designed to perform well for the second objective in practice when data does not conform to worst-case input characteristics Our experimental results on three real-world data sets showed that our methods of setting the precision gradient are greatly superior to na  ve strategies under both metrics on all data sets studied Acknowledgments We thank Arvind Arasu and Dawn Song for their valuable input and assistance References  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In VLDB  1994  I Akamai T echnologies Akamai http://www akamai.com   A Ak ella A Bharambe M Reiter  and S Seshan Detecting DDoS attacks on ISP networks In PODS Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams  2003  A Arasu and G S Manku Approximate quantiles and frequency counts over sliding windows In PODS  2004  B Babcock and C Olston Distrib uted top-k monitoring In SIGMOD  2003  M Charikar  K  Chen and M F arach-Colton Finding frequent items in data streams In International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming  2002  E Cohen and M Strauss Maintaining time-decaying stream aggregates In PODS  2003  G Cormode and S Muthukrishnan What s hot and whats not Tracking frequent items dynamically In PODS  2003  E D Demaine A Lopez-Ortiz and J I Munro Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space In European Symposium on Algorithms  2003  DynaServ er R UBis and R UBBos http://www.cs rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer   eBay Inc eBay  http://www.ebay.com   C Estan and G V a r ghese Ne w directions in traf c measurement and accounting In SIGCOMM  2002  M F ang N Shi v akumar  H  Garcia-Molina R Motwani and J Ulmann Computing iceberg queries efciently In VLDB  1998  P  B Gibbons and Y  Matias Ne w sampling-based summary statistics for improving approximate query answers In SIGMOD  1998  P  B Gibbons and S T irthapura Estimating simple functions on the union of data streams In Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  2001  M Greenw ald and S Khanna Po wer conserving computation of order-statistics over sensor networks In PODS  2004  J Han J Pei G Dong and K W ang Ef cient computation of iceberg queries with complex measures In SIGMOD  2001  Internet2 Internet2 Abilene Netw ork http abilene.internet2.edu   R M Karp S Shenk er  and C H P apadimitriou A simple algorithm for nding frequent elements in streams and bags ACM Trans Database Syst  2003  H.-A Kim and B Karp Autograph T o w ard automated distributed worm signature detection In Proceedings of the 13th Usenix Security Symposium  2004  A Manjhi V  Shkapen yuk K Dhamdhere and C Olston Finding recently frequent items in distributed data streams Technical report 2004 http://www cs.cmu.edu/manjhi/freqItems.pdf   G S Manku and R Motw ani Approximate frequenc y counts over data streams In VLDB  2002  Open Source De v elopment Netw ork Inc Slashdot http://slashdot.org  Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresby PCA, number of records by FP-Growth By experiments, found the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
