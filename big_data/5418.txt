Mining Changes in Purchase Behavior in Retail Sale with Products as Conditional Part Pradip Kumar Bala OM&DS Area Xavier Institute of Management Bhubaneswar, INDIA e-mail address: p_k_bala@rediffmail.com AbstractChange mining gives an insight to the retailers on the changing purchase patterns of the shoppers. Purchase pattern of shoppers sometimes depends on other products purchased Hence, conditional part of a pattern in the form of an association rule contains products. The research paper proposes an approach for change mining where conditional part may contain products or items Keywords-association rule, change mining, data mining, item, pattern changes, product, retail I. INTRODUCTION Marketing strategy in retailing is improved by understanding the shoppers behavior. Retailers try to learn on how they think, feel, reason, and select between different alternative brands or products. In view of competitive environment in retailing, it has become necessary for the retailers to understand the purchase behavior of consumers The consumers shopping record \(e.g., products purchased frequency of shopping, monetary value of shopping etc demographic information \(e.g., income, educational level of adults in the household, occupations of adults, ages of children whether the family owns a house etc used for mining purchase behavior of the shoppers. With changes in income, cost of living, number and age of the children, social and cultural forces, purchase behavior of a shopper may change with time. For retailers, it is necessary to learn these changes. In the parlance of data mining, discovering the changes in purchase behavior using data mining techniques is known as change mining. Purchase behavior is generally represented by the association rules in the following forms Gender = Male => Purchase = Snack Foods Gender = Female and Age = [30-40 Purchase = Vegetables and Snack Foods The symbol, =>, is read as associates. LHS of => is known as antecedent or, condition and RHS of => is known as consequent. First example says that if a 


customer happens to be male, he is very likely to purchase snack foods. The second example says that if a customer happens to be female of age in between 30 to 40, she is very likely to purchase vegetables and snack foods Strength of an association rule is measured in terms of support, confidence and lift. With total no. of transactions \(rows association rule, X => Y Support of X=>Y = n\(XY XY of transactions \(rows Confidence of X=>Y = [n \(XY X X is number of transactions \(rows Lift of X=>Y =   \(Confidence of the rule Support of Y n \(XY X Y n\(Y rows Y present n \(XY Y Various aspects of changes in purchase behavior can be explained as given below A purchase behavior exists in period, P-1, and it does not exist in the next period, P-2 A purchase behavior does not exist in period, P1, and it exists in the next period, P-2 A purchase behavior exists in both P-1 and P-2 but with different degrees of intensities given by the strength of the association rule A particular attribute is with different values in P-1 and P-2, although otherwise, same purchase behavior exists in both the periods Four types of change patterns in purchase behavior as available in literature are emerging Patterns, added patterns, perished patterns and unexpected changes \([1 2], [3], [4 Emerging patterns are association rules existing in both present and past. Supports of emerging patterns generally vary from period, P-1 to next period, P-2 Emerging patterns may be positive with increase in support and negative with decrease in support Example of emerging pattern, \(a, b c, d 78978-1-4244-4791-6/10/$25.00 c2010 IEEE 


In P-1, association rule, \(a, b c, d 30 In P-2, association rule, \(a, b c, d 40 Added pattern is a new pattern found in the present which was not existing in the past. Generally, all conditional and consequent parts of an association rule added pattern any association rule in previous period, P-1 Perished pattern is a vanished pattern found in the past but not in the present. Generally, all conditional and consequent parts of an association rule \(perished pattern in period, P-1, differ significantly from any rule in next period, P-2 Unexpected change may be with unexpected consequent change, where the conditional parts remain same, but the consequent parts change with time, or, it may be with unexpected conditional change, where, the consequent parts remain same, but the conditional parts change with time Measure of rule similarity in two periods under study is used for mining emerging patterns, added patterns and perished patterns, whereas measure of unexpectedness is used for mining the patterns of unexpected change The work in [2] developed the similarity measure to analyze the degree of similarity between patterns at different periods of time. However, the application of this measure is limited to cover only single item in the consequent \(i.e., RHS of an association rule  gives a modified similarity measure to address more than one item in the consequent part and rule-similarity is measured as the product of LHS-similarity and RHSsimilarity Hence, Rule-Similarity = LHS-Similarity x RHSSimilarity A rule in one period is compared with all the rules of another period and rule-similarities are measured Maximum of all these rule-similarities is called maximum rule similarity for the rule under consideration. Maximum rule similarity is one for two exactly same rules with same antecedents and consequents, although strength of the rules may be 


different. Research in [5] gives an approach to mine changes in the patterns as discussed in the next paragraphs A rule will be called an emerging pattern, if its similarity is 1 with a rule mined from the data of another period Requirement for emerging pattern is that its maximum rule similarity is 1 For perished pattern and added pattern, rule matching threshold \(RMT degree of change. A rule will be called a perished pattern if maximum rule-similarity of this rule with the rules in later period is less than RMT. Similarly, a rule will be called an added pattern if maximum rule-similarity of this rule with the rules in earlier period is less than RMT As mentioned earlier, measure of unexpectedness is used for mining the patterns of unexpected change. A threshold value of unexpectedness is used to measure the degree of change.  Requirement for unexpected consequent pattern is that the value of unexpectedness is 1 and requirement for unexpected conditional pattern is that the unexpectedness is -1 The work in [5] does not consider products in LHS of a pattern depicted by association rule. For rules containing products in LHS \(antecedent or, conditional part RHS \(consequent part can not be simply extended without an appropriate modification for the measure of similarity II. PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION There are many patterns observed in retail sale where we find products in the conditional part \([6], [7 fact that there is no existing work for change mining where a product or a number of products find place in the conditional also known as antecedent give a measure for similarity in such cases. To explain the case further, let us consider the following two situations Situation-I Patterns in period-1 and period-2 are as given below Period-1: \(a, b c, d products Period-2: \(e, f g, h products 


As per the existing measure, i.e., Chen et al. \(2005 similarity can be measured in the following way Number of common features/products in LHS of two rules LHS-Similarity Total number of features/products included  in the LHS of both the rules Number of features/products with same attribute-values in LHS of the rules x Number of common features/products in LHS of two rules  2010 IEEE 2nd International Advance Computing Conference 79 Number of common products in RHS of two rules RHS-Similarity Total number of products included In the RHS of both the rules Number of products with same attribute-values in RHS of the rules x Number of common products in RHS of two rules LHS-Similarity = 0 RHS-Similarity = 0 Rule-Similarity = 0 x 0 = 0 Situation-II Period-1: \(a, b c, d Period-2: \(c, d a, b Here LHS-Similarity = 0 RHS-Similarity = 0 Rule-Similarity = 0 x 0 = 0 Hence, it is observed that rule-similarity is same \(zero in both situation-I and II, although situation-II demands higher rule-similarity. It is because in situation-II simultaneous purchase of all four items a, b, c, d enjoys very high support \(without high support, a rule is not considered a valid pattern conditional parts may be dissimilar, consequent parts may also be dissimilar; however, overall purchase may 


be a simultaneous purchase of a number of items Simultaneous purchase of items itself is a purchase pattern. It is observed that the existing measure can not measure the similarity in appropriate way as it is expected from practical point of view in retailing. There may be other cases also where the existing measure of similarity is not appropriate to depict the reality. The problem chosen in this research paper is to develop an appropriate measure for similarity in the context of change mining where, conditional part may also contain products or items III. NEW APPROACH FOR CHANGE MINING As discussed in last section, similarity with respect to overall purchase of items must be accounted for while computing rule similarity. Hence, while computing overall rule-similarity; overall product-similarity should also be a factor along with LHS-similarity and RHS-similarity Hence, Overall Rule-Similarity =  LHS-Similarity x RHS-Similarity x Overall-Product Similarity Overall rule-similarity in the new approach is a product of three fractions in contrast to a product of two fractions in the old approach. Hence, rule matching threshold RMT lower value than that in the old approach IV. ILLUSTRATION WITH AN EXAMPLE Eleven \(11 with one thousand \(1,000 the profiles of the customers. To understand the database, as it is not possible to show 1,000 records of the database in this paper, five illustrative records have been shown in Table 1 from which one can visualize various fields in the database Eleven items have been named as  a, b, c, d, e, f, g h, i, j and k in this table. Out of one thousand \(1,000 transactions, first five hundred \(500 period \(P-1 500 second period \(P-2 purchased by a customer along with a small profile of the customers.  The profile contains value \(as rated by the retailer payment method by cheque/cash/card etc Male/Female expressed in M/F 


yes/no in this table. Customer id is an identification code for the customer and it finds use for capturing the sequence of purchases made by the same customer and hence in mining sequence rules. Otherwise, customer id is not of any use for mining other patterns TABLE I.

Analysis Two patterns as obtained from data mining of the above data have been considered for analysis in this paper. As discussed earlier, rule matching threshold \(RMT in the new measure is to be kept at lower value than that in the existing measure. RMTs for the existing measure and new 


measure have been kept at 0.6 and 0.3 respectively i Sex=M, Income<16650 The above rule exists in both the periods, P-1 and P-2 Hence, it is an emerging pattern. However rule support reduces from 15.2 % in P-1 to 11.4% in P-2. As the support reduces, the pattern is a negative emerging pattern in both the existing and proposed measures ii Sex=M, Income<16650, Frozen Meal Veg The rule exists only in the period-I As per the existing measure Maximum rule similarity = 0.5. It happens with the following rule of period-II Sex=M, Income<16650, Beer For RMT = 0.6, the considered rule is a perished pattern As per the proposed measure Maximum rule similarity = 0.33. It happens with the following rule of period-II Sex=M, Income<16650 Canned Veg, Frozen Meal For RMT = 0.3, the considered rule is not a perished pattern V. CONCLUSION To accommodate products in the conditional part of a pattern, a new approach for measuring similarity as a basis for change mining has been proposed in this research paper. The suggested approach can be used for mining more realistic change patterns in purchase behavior of the shoppers in retailing.

n-dimension data cube\( I1  I k Support=sup_count/total_count 2 3 4. Performance Analysis Example 2 Lets talk about a practical problem just like the status of sales. Assume that we will mine the association rules involved 4 dimension attributes of sales, the minsup=25%. First of all, using OLAP technology to build a 4-D data cube and the 4 dimension attributes are: time location, item, and supplier. For location dimension which contains area, country and so on, we choose province level We use brand level for item dimension, company level for supplier dimension. Time dimension can be divided as Q1 1-3 4-6 7-9 10-12 location\(P1,P2,L1,L2 York, item\(B1,B2,B3,B4 C1,C2,C3 sales data cube can be generalized like this Graphic 2: The 4-Dimension Data Cube of Sales The details of this sales data cube are in the table follow: The amount of cells is 100 Location Time Item Supplier Count Cell-1 P1 Q1 B1 C2 5 Cell-2 P1 Q3 B1 C1 2 Cell-99 L1 Q3 B1 C1 3 Cell-100 L2 Q4 B1 C3 11 Table 2: The details data table of sales data cube We use original Apriori_Cube Algorithm to find frequent predicate set with minsup_num= 25%*100=25 According the data table we calculate that sup_count of every member of dimension L is \(P1:8, P2:5, L1:1, L2:24 and also T, I, S. So there is the process Graphic 3: The processes of old algorithm As we know, through comparing with the minsup_num dimension location has no one frequent 1-predicate set, so that there have no frequent 4-predicate set in the output by the original algorithm. But users are interested in the Candidate 1-Predicate set L T I S P1 P2 L1

But this time, users require that different members from dimension item can exist at the same time So we redo this mining process by the improved Algorithm Graphic 4: The processes of improved algorithm At last, we got the frequent 4-predicate set which the users are interested in, and then can format the rules 5. Conclusion In this paper, we have studied issues and methods on efficient mining of multi-dimension association rules based on data cube. With the development of technology, the size 


of database has become much huge than ever before unimaginable. So the multi-dimension model of database based on data cube has become useful and popular relatively how to mine useful multi-dimension association rules based on this model has been important too. Among the algorithms for the problems we choose the most classify one to improve, to make it more efficient and useful An efficient algorithm, Apriori_Cube_Improved, has been developed which explores the multi-dimension association rules. First, we use max_support and min_support of every frequent 1-predicate set to check the levels of dimensions, and then adjust the data cube by roll-up and drill-down operation immediately. This step is embed in the process of mining association rules, so it makes the rules much more useful and flexible; second applying one predicate set contains no more than one different level from the same dimension and SP pruning can help reduce the amount of predicate set, especially with the great growing of the number. So the speed of algorithm improved is faster than ever At last, there are also many other interesting issues and flaws of the algorithm which call for further study including efficient mining multi-dimension association rules of complex measures and so on.

But this time, users require that different 


members from dimension item can exist at the same time So we redo this mining process by the improved Algorithm Graphic 4: The processes of improved algorithm At last, we got the frequent 4-predicate set which the users are interested in, and then can format the rules 5. Conclusion In this paper, we have studied issues and methods on efficient mining of multi-dimension association rules based on data cube. With the development of technology, the size of database has become much huge than ever before unimaginable. So the multi-dimension model of database based on data cube has become useful and popular relatively how to mine useful multi-dimension association rules based on this model has been important too. Among the algorithms for the problems we choose the most classify one to improve, to make it more efficient and useful An efficient algorithm, Apriori_Cube_Improved, has been developed which explores the multi-dimension association rules. First, we use max_support and min_support of every frequent 1-predicate set to check the levels of dimensions, and then adjust the data cube by roll-up and drill-down operation immediately. This step is embed in the process of mining association rules, so it makes the rules much more useful and flexible; second applying one predicate set contains no more than one different level from the same dimension and SP pruning can help reduce the amount of predicate set, especially with the great growing of the number. So the speed of algorithm improved is faster than ever At last, there are also many other interesting issues and flaws of the algorithm which call for further study including efficient mining multi-dimension association rules of complex measures and so on.
