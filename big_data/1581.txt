Introduction\nTraditionally, when we think about the problems posed\nby the BIG DATA, we have in mind either the amount of\nrecords \(data length records \(data width volatility [1]. In this article, however,\nwe address the problems and challenges that arise when\nwe are faced with data that may not be very large, but is\nvery rich. This can be referred to as deep data, by analogy\nto the notion of Deep Web [2] used to describe vast amount\nof information laying under the surface of Web pages.\nIf our task is to process and analyze a deep data set, we\nmay quickly find out, that this creates various problems\nthat are typically found in big data processing. The fact\nthat there may be a plethora of relations within a scope\nof a single data entity \(record quickly leads to “explosion” of demand\nfor creating more and more entities in the data warehouse\nin order to preserve this information for further use.\nThis paper shows how relatively small collection of data\nmay expand into really big one once we attempt to repre-\nsent its internal structure and meaning. We use an example\nof the system created as a part of our R&D project in the\narea of semantic search and analytics. We demonstrate\na huge expansion in the size and variety of information\nwhile extracting the representation of semantic knowledge\nfrom initial data \(scientific articles catered.\nSupported by the grant SP/I/1/77065/10 in frame of the strategic\nscientific research and experimental development program: “Inter-\ndisciplinary System for Interactive Scientific and Scientific-Technical\nInformation” founded by Polish National Centre for Research and\nDevelopment \(NCBiR well as grants 2011/01/B/ST6/03867 and\n2012/05/B/ST6/03215 from Polish National Science Centre \(NCN exploration in the semantic knowledge contained in\ndeep data leads to emergence of various big data issues.\nOne of particular interests to us \(in scope of this paper into structure\nof semantic relationships in articles, more and more data\ninstances corresponding to various entities \(persons, insti-\ntutions, publishers, journals, topics, etc asynchronous and may yield multiple and\nnon-identical data instances that all correspond to one and\nthe same real-life object. Matching, which may be viewed\nas a special kind of data deduplication and cleansing 3],\n[4], aims at finding and unifying such instances. As the\noriginal data is inherently imprecise, so is the resulting\nknowledge. This makes standard, on-load deduplication\napproaches infeasible due to prohibitive cost of certain\ndata transformations. The entities that we are dealing\nwith are by definition compound multi-level, noisy and\nincomplete. The amount and complexity of comparisons\nneeded to sort out such data is enormous. Hence, in order\nto match instances one has to resort to approximate, off-\nline methods originating in areas such as: soft computing,\ngranular computing, approximate reasoning and so on.\nThe matching process results in creation of data objects\nthat are aggregations of information contained in original\ndata instances With these objects – if necessary, rolling\nback to instances that match them – we progress to further\nsteps of creation of complete semantic search system.\nObjects are the input for procedures tasked with creation\nof semantic search indices, analysis of data trends, and\nvarious types of classification. A collection of data objects\nthat we create is by definition as deep or even deeper than\nthe raw data we started with. Thus, the problems with\ndeep data becoming big one are with us all the way.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we\noutline basic ideas behind our system for semantic search\nand analytics. In Section III, using an example of scientific\narticles loaded into our system, we show how the search for\nsemantic relationships may lead toward big data problems.\nIn particular, we discuss how we can cope with the task\nof named entity matching using approximate methods. In\nSection IV, we present a case study done on part of the\nPubMed database. Section V concludes our work.\n579978-1-4799-0348-1/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE\n  DOCUMENT DATABASE SoncaDB ALGORITHMS \n RELATIONSHIP DETECTION \n OBJECT  TRANSFORMATION \nOFFLINE GROUPING & RANKING \nOUTPUT INDEX COMPUTATION \n… \n  USER INTERFACE \nUSER \nQUERY \nPARSER \nITERATIVE \nRESULT \nBUILDER \nM1 \nM2 \nM3 \n… \n  SEMANTIC INDICES \n Publication Index #1 \n Publication Index #2 \nScientist Index #1 \nScientist Index #2 \n… \n  DIRECT USERS \n  SYNAT PLATFORMS \nFig. 1.

project \(abbreviation of Polish “SYstem\nNAuki i Techniki” [7 aimed at establishment of a unified net-\nwork platform for storing and serving digital information\nin widely understood areas of science and technology. The\nproject is composed of nearly 50 modules developed by the\nteams at 16 research institutions in Poland.\nOur research group’s task within scope of SYNAT was\nto design and implement a sub-system for searching within\nrepositories of scientific information \(articles biographical\nnotes, etc abbr. for Search based on\nONtologies and Compound Analytics – [5]–[8 see Fig. 1 answering the\nuser query by presenting the resources \(documents, Web\npages, etc semantically. It has to\nmodel an understanding of the query’s intention and of the\ncontents of stored documents. It should be able to retrieve\nand transform relevant information with high efficacy. It\nalso should be able to use various knowledge bases related\nto the investigated areas of science. Finally, it has to\nallow using independent sources of information about the\nanalyzed objects, e.g., information about scientists who\nmay be identified as the papers’ authors.\nIn SONCA, each document corpus is converted into a\nrelational form in order to search, filter, and analyze the\ndata using well established methodologies, making the best\npossible use of the available structural and semantic infor-\n<Document>\n<Abstract>\nEffects of magnesium on...\n<\\Abstract>\n<Section>\nHigh magnesium doses were...\n<\\Section>\n<\\Document>\nid\nin\nst\nan\nce\nid\nsu\npe\nri\nns\nta\nnc\ne\nst\nar\nt\npo\ns\nen\nd\npo\ns\nin\nst\nan\nce\nty\npe\n wo\nrd\n1 0 2984 Document\n2 1 0 512 Abstract\n3 2 0 1 word Effects\n4 2 1 2 word of\n5 2 2 3 word magnesium\n6 2 3 4 word on\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n513 1 513 1393 Section\n514 951 513 514 word High\n515 951 514 515 word magnesium\n516 951 515 516 word doses\n517 951 516 517 word were\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\nFig. 2. Example tabular form of a part of PubMed file \(from [8 gives\ndevelopers of analytic algorithms a choice between various\nmethods of data processing. The information contained in\ndocuments is by nature compound and discovered relations\nbetween their parts and other entities in data are crucial\nto preserve. A relational framework provides a convenient\nmeans to store all types of information within an inte-\ngrated generic data model. On the other hand, the original\nnon-tabular forms of acquired documents are worth storing\ntoo. Hence, the central place in the architecture of SONCA\n\(Fig. 1 occupied by SoncaDB – a data warehouse with\nboth SQL and NoSQL components.\nOur data schema is designed with use of EAV/CR model\n[9]. It has two layers: instance and object. The instances\nmay be as basic as single word or, e.g., they may represent\nlarger parts of documents, with preserved connections to\nsimpler components \(see Fig. 2 words that appear in text. We have\nto account for all kinds of relationships. Simplest such\nrelationship is the occurrence of a certain word in a certain\ndocument. A more involved relationship is that of being a\nco-author of a given document or a relationship that binds\ntwo scientific articles by the fact that one cites the other.\nA special case is the relationship that binds the documents\nwith a set of keywords that can be further matched with\na preset vocabulary \(or ontology, such as MeSH in case of\nPubMed possible to group documents by\ntheir semantic content.\n580\nAppropriate representation of all the above-mentioned\ntypes of information requires – for the expected millions\nof input documents – billions of the resulting rows. Table I\non the next page shows how the number of data instances\nrapidly grows even for a relatively small amount of articles.\nHence, the underlying RDBMS technologies need to be\nvery carefully adjusted [5], [6]. In order to keep the size\nof SQL database at bay and execute the queries efficiently\nwe have employed the Infobright’s RDBMS engine \(see e.g.\n[10 our\nown implementations with technologies such as MongoDB,\nCassandra, and Lucene. Also, SONCA should integrate\nwell with the overall SYNAT software platforms \(see Fig.\n1 in accordance\nwith technologies and standards of the project, including\nYADDA and BWMeta [11].\nIII. Matching with Big Data\nThe unfolding of deep, dense data into a huge collection\nof instances can very quickly lead to serious computational\nchallenges. Moreover, conversion of documents creates a\nlot of duplicates. This is due to the fact that we create\na separate instance to preserve every appearance of the\ndocument, including an instance for any reference to it\nin other documents. We do the same also with other\ntypes of instances derived from documents and references.\nThese instance sets are initially not synchronized due to\nrequirements for the parser to work efficiently and trans-\nparently. It is actually not possible to go back and forth\nalong the document queue to check if something similar is\nalready loaded, especially given the potentially high cost of\ncomparisons between structured data entities. Thus, data\ncleansing, deduplication and regularization further called\nmatching [12 in\nthe relational part of SoncaDB: instance and object. The\nprocess of matching has to identify all 


appearances of data\ninstances and tie them to a single object. Such object is\nmeant to be a unique representation of some real-world\nentity. We choose to preserve all instances associated with\na given object This is motivated as follows:\n• The information contained in instances may be in-\ncomplete, vague, or even inconsistent. If the object\nthat matches them causes data quality problems,\nwe may track it back to the source and use this\ninformation to improve data quality.\n• Matching is an iterative process. As new articles enter\nthe repository, new groups of instances are created.\nThey may partially match existing objects and the\ninformation they contain may lead to object changes.\nThus, we need a complete track of instances.\nSONCA operates on entities corresponding to publica-\ntions \(scientific articles, books, etc authors,\neditors affiliations key-\nwords, classifications Such entities/objects\n– commonly referred to as named entities – have to be\nwell identified and stored in object layer of RDBMS in\nsuch a way that they well support next steps, i.e., scien-\ntific trend analysis enhanced classification, and creation\nof semantic indices exported to other SONCA/SYNAT\nmodules [13], [14]. We need to design a matching pro-\ncess that faces computational challenges of processing\nsuch heterogeneous data In our approach, we begin with\nidentifying all instances corresponding to a given object.\nThen, we establish the values for object’s properties, as\nthey may differ between the duplicated instances. Finally,\nwe examine relations that bind instances and transfer\ntheir relevant parts \(necessary to build, e.g., co-author or\ncitation graphs an object – is one\nof the main points where issues with big data arise.\nAll algorithms that we examined in order to group\ninstances into clusters corresponding to objects generally\ncomprise of the following stages 5], [12]:\n1 support the\nsame objects, using some instance properties and\nattributes. \(In some implementations, we let buckets\nslightly overlap with each other matchable\ninstances are not together versus the buckets’ size\nwhich should be kept moderately small.\n2 the contents of each single bucket, employ lo-\ncally more advanced clustering algorithms based on\ndistance/similarity functions that make it possible to\ncompare compound instances. \(Such functions may\nbe constructed and applied semi-manually or learned\nfrom data using methods from AI, Machine Learning\nand Soft Computing [14], [15 as representing the\nsame objects. \(For the sake of efficiency, such verifi-\ncation is done only for clusters from the neighboring\nbuckets, i.e., buckets that overlap or those with\nsimilar partition signatures information about instance memberships into\nclusters in a tabular form, stating a bridge between\nthe instance and object layers within the integrated\nSoncaDB’s relational data schema.\nCertainly, the above steps can be discussed in a broader\ncontext of popular methods of decomposing computational\ntasks \(see e.g. [16 need to remember that the\ndata in SONCA may keep changing. The most typical\nevent instigating such changes is the load of a new set\nof documents into the repository. This should immediately\nresult in updates for SoncaDB tables, semantic indices and\nanalytical components. As already mentioned, depending\non the adopted approach introduction of new instances\ninto the matching process may result in various modifi-\ncations in object layer The simplest such change is the\ncreation of a new object when the instance does not match\n581\nany of existing ones. However, if the newly introduced\ninstance matches some objects we may decide that we\nwant an object to be split into two or, conversely, merge\ntwo \(or more information contained in the newly matched\ninstance indicates that at earlier matching step we have\nhaphazardly grouped together some instances that are not\none and the same, because the amount of information we\nhad at the time was insufficient to tell them apart. The\nlatter case may occur when new instance contains the\ninformation that makes it possible to establish similarity\nbetween records \(objects that was not present in any of\nthe previously seen instances.\nThe dynamic nature of the object layer may result in\nvarious challenges. One imaginable task, that is related to\nbig data and potentially massive computational effort is\nthe optimization of matching process by scheduling the\ninflow of new instances in such a way that the resulting\nobject creation process is optimized too.\nIV. PubMed Case Study\nIn order to illustrate computational challenges that we\nface, let us bring the example of PubMed Central \(PMC the digital archive of full-text journal\nliterature related to biomedical research [17]. The articles\nfrom PMC are obviously just one of possible document\nsources. PMC Open Subset constitutes only about 10%\nof the whole PubMed. However, the fact that we do not\nhave the entire database is not a concern, as we want\nour solution to be applicable to incomplete information\nsources. In this case, all information we are working with\nis contained in SoncaDB and it results from processing\nPMC texts. Even if a named entity \(document person,\ninstitution, etc 


appear in\nany of the processed documents. Moreover, the instances\nand objects that we create may not have equivalents in\nthe whole PubMed, as there are many citations in PMC\narticles that point at scientific articles as well as their\nauthors, publishers, etc because our goal is to\ndevise a method that deals with various types of document\ncorpora that we may encounter in the future.\nOne may treat the following subsections of our case\nstudy as a guideline how to adjust parameters of the\ngeneral matching process outlined in the previous section\nto specific types of instances.\nA Matching publications\nFollowing the categorization defined in [3], the task of\ngrouping together instances that represent the same pub-\nlication entails both content-based and structure-based\nmatching. In case of matching documents for which at\nleast one instance corresponds to something originally\nstored in the local repository the task is relatively easy.\nNot only are the property values highly consistent across\nall instances, but we also have detailed information how\nthey were created, as we possess the full technical spec-\nification of the algorithms used by parser/loader during\ntheir creation. In case of our PubMed exercise the only\nnoticeable problems we had with such instances occurred\nwhen the document they originated from was damaged\nor violated formatting rules. This, however, was just a\nhandful of cases \(below 0.5 figures about the matching experiment conducted for\nthe PMC data stored in SONCA \(extension of [12 Value\nNumber of PMC documents processed 220,881\nNumber of instances of all types 1,835,643,162\nNumber of instances of type ’publication’ 6,416,448\nNumber and percentage of ’publication’\ninstances from citations\n6,195,567 \(96.56 of initially\nmatched ’publication’ instances\n5,068,483 \(79 matching one instance\n1,410,884 \(61 object\n2835\nAverage consistency for ’publication’ ob-\nject properties \(excl. title name,surname> pairs 3,400,180\nNumber of objects of type ’person’ 8,349,260\nNumber of unique ’affiliation instances 615,087\nVast majority \(almost 97% in case of PubMed – see\nTable I created from refer-\nences included in “real” documents, existing as full texts\nin repository. Instances derived from references usually\ncontain little information. For these instances we need to\ncheck first if they can be matched to an object that was\ncreated earlier. Then, we may attempt to match property\nvalues of the instance with that of matching object \(if\nthey existed derived \(parsed unique PubMed ID [18], DOI, ISBN/ISSN value to check\nif it has already been associated with any object existing\nin our database. If no such property is present, we move\nto secondary, less reliable ones.\nThe use of unique identifiers made it possible to cre-\nate objects of type ’publication’ that match 79% of all\n’publication’ instances created. We consider this suc-\ncess rate” quite satisfactory, given how little useful and\nconsistent information is available for some instances re-\ntrieved from references. Unfortunately, the reminder of\n’publication’ instances was quite frequently distorted. In\norder to match these we have to consider some im-\nportant efficiency issues Potentially, each of those not\nyet matched instances may correspond to any of the\nalready existing publication’ objects. But, if we were\nto check all the possibilities, we would have to perform\n582\nnumberobjects × numberunmatched instances comparisons\nbetween structural data entities, which in our case is\naround 2.81 · 1012. Similar problems surface if we add new\ndocuments to already existing database.\nOnce we have established objects and matched them\nwith instances, we should determine property values for\neach object. There may be conflicts and discrepancies\nbetween property values from various instances of the\nsame object and they need to be dealt with. Fortunately,\nin our PubMed case study, out of 16 properties that\nwe have considered only three – title, lastpage and\npublish year – showed significant inconsistency. As it\nturned out, most of inconsistencies in publish year \(year\nof publication fields were easy to identify\nand correct. Thanks to that, SONCA’s parser/loader has\nsubsequently been improved and the current version pro-\nduces no inconsistencies in publish year.\nWhen comparing titles, it was no longer worth com-\nputing similarity of texts \(title sentences from particular\nmatched clusters and processed them using some NLP\nmethods [12], [14]. As it often happens for references,\nthe extracted titles were modifications, sometimes quite\nextensive, of the original, full titles We had to account\nfor common practices such as shortening, usage of abbre-\nviations, omission of parts of sentences and so on. The\nmethods we have used made it possible to assign a unique\nand correct title to nearly all ’publication’ objects. Thanks\nto the first matching step, all comparison, filtering and\nconflict solving tasks we needed to perform were reduced\nto one object at the time, i.e., no more than 2835 instances\nat once In 61% of cases \(see Table I 


persons\nIn case of matching persons’ names we are faced with\ndifficult task resulting from the way these names usually\nenter our database. As vast majority of persons are identi-\nfied as authors or editors mentioned in references, we often\ndo not have their full given names. Just a quick look at any\nlist of references reveals the severity of the problem. It can\nget even more challenging, when we not only have to match\nthe authors, but we need to find where the names are\nin the text. For some ’publication’ instances created from\nreferences the entire information is contained in a single,\nunstructured text field. It is for us to analyze this text and\nfind out which of its parts corresponds to authors name,\nsurname, affiliation and so on. While for the particular\ncase of PMC this problem is relatively unfrequent, for\nother data sets it is a norm. Various methods – including\nthose based on networks of fuzzy comparators [14], [15] –\ncan be employed in order to create ’person’ instances as-\nsociated with such potentially troublesome ’publications’\nand assign them properties \(name, surname, email, etc performed prior to matching, although there\nare some algorithmic analogies between these stages.\nAs we have found out, the content based matching in\ncase of ’person’ objects is inefficient. There is simply not\nenough information in two or three words that constitute\nperson’s name, especially when only initials of given names\nare available. Therefore, we construct additional attributes\nthat make it possible to either discern or group names.\nIn some cases the names can be identified thanks to e-\nmail address or associated URL, but this is not a common\nfeature. For the lion share of persons the first step is to use\nthe co-author relationship graph, a bit like it was done in\nDBLP [19] and Arnetminer [20]. By comparing co-author\ngraphs for two instances we can decide if they represent\nthe same named entity \(object valuable information contained in the citation\ngraph. As we have large part of citation graph for matched\npublications stored in our data warehouse, we can use this\ngraph to construct a filter eliminating the instances that\nare irrelevant for a current object and leave for further,\nmore detailed examination only the instances that have\nsome relationship to the object in discourse.\nIt is worth mentioning, that both co-author and citation\ngraphs are possible to retrieve and process efficiently\nthanks to preservation of all data in the two previously\ndescribed steps, i.e., conversion of documents to relational\nformat and publication matching In our case study it\nwas possible to establish object and perform matching for\nover 95% of instances of type person’ found in previously\nmatched instances of type ’publication’. Note \(see Table\nI publications we produce signifi-\ncantly less objects than the initial number of ’publication’\ninstances, it is the opposite in case of persons. This is\ncompletely natural, as there may be quite many different\npersons sharing a common name, e.g., J. Smith.\nC. Matching other named entities\nSome of the other named entities are relatively easy to\ndeal with, thanks to existence of fairly trustworthy and\ncomprehensive sources of domain knowledge. They are a\ngood illustration of the importance of initial information\nquality for the purposes of semantic data processing. An\nexample of object types that can be smoothly and precisely\nmatched with corresponding instances are journals and\npublishers. This is thanks to the fact that there are not\nthat many of them \(tens of thousands at most such as Web of Knowledge or Scopus. In case\nof journals there also exists an official methodology for\nabbreviating their titles.\nThe toughest and so far not fully answered challenge for\nour system is to match affiliations. Various problems that\narise when attempting to deal with affiliations in publi-\ncation databases, in particular in PubMed, are described\nin [21], [22]. Our problems in this particular case study\nwere even worse, as we only dealt with a small, scattered\nsubset of the database. Table I shows that on average there\n583\nis hardly one affiliation given for every four ’publication’\nobjects. In case of persons this proportion is more than\nthirteen to one, even before cleansing and deduplication.\nAs a result, matching of affiliations in SONCA is currently\ndone only for completely obvious cases.\nV. Conclusion\nOur goal in this paper was to sketch some scenarios that\nrequire transforming relatively small collections of data\nobjects into data sets that are bigger by several orders of\nmagnitude, as a result of a pursuit to explicitly represent\ninternal and external relations between compound objects,\ntheir components, and their properties. As an example we\nconsidered some aspects of one of our R&D projects aiming\nat semantic indexing and analytics of scientific articles\nstored in a hybrid database architecture.\nIn our case study we focused on the problem of matching\ninstances parsed from different sources, which yield, e.g.,\noften incomplete or even partially incorrect descriptions\nof articles extracted from references of other articles. Our\ntask is then to establish that a group of such instances\nactually corresponds to the same object. Although this\ntask may seem to be limited to only one of data processing\nstages, the significant computational burden it creates is\nsymptomatic to the whole range of issues associated with\nrich content of a scientific data warehouse.\nAnalogous challenges can be observed also in other\nareas of applications. Wherever we require a software\nplatform for advanced 


analysis of compound objects – not\nnecessarily related to document repositories or any other\nkind of scientific content – we have to be prepared for\nemergence of challenging problems typical for big data.\nThe final conclusion is that we should watch out as even a\nseemingly small volume of initial entities may lead to huge\nexpansion in data size and computational effort once we\nattempt to reach for its semantics.\nReferences\n[1] H.

Illnesses \n• Suffer from Many Allergies \nThe following are the negative effects on a body from \nhaving cortisol present for too long: \n• Impaired cognitive performance \n• Suppressed thyroid function \n• Blood sugar imbalances such as hyperglycemia \n• Decreased bone density \n• Decrease in muscle tissue \n• Higher blood pressure \n• Lowered inununity and inflammatory responses in the \nbody, slowed wound healing, and other health nconsequences \n• Increased abdominal fat, which is associated with a \ngreater amount of health problems than fat deposited in \nother areas of the body. \n• Heart attacks \n• Strokes \n• The development of metabolic syndrome, higher levels \nof "bad" cholesterol \(LDL HDL lead to death. \nVIII. DEPRESSION \nDepression occurs when a person ignores the many \nmessages from the FOFR for a prolong time and the \nbrains thalamus/hypothalamus area releases chemicals \nat levels different than it would if the person was \nresponding properly to the FOFR. Depression is the \nfirst of many survival mechanisms the brain's pseudo \nconsciousness resorts to as it is forced to continuously \nwork to communicate with the conscious using limited \ncommunications methods that are often ignored by the \nconscious. It is all too common for people to become \ninsensitive to their feelings and emotions as a survival \nmechanism. \nFigure 20. The Balanced Lifestyle Necessary for \nTreating and Curing Mental Illness Includes making the \nChanges for Creating and Living a Balanced Lifestyle. \nAgain, depression is the fIrst attempt by the \nhypothalamus/subconscious portion of the brain to \ncommunicate with our conscious mind and inform us \nthat the conscious mind is ignoring the messages from \nour FOFR. These messages include hunches, feelings \nand emotions. These messages can number in the \nhundreds and range from the obvious to the subtle. \nThe time it takes the subconscious its messages are \nbeing ignored is in the years, before the symptoms \nfrom depression become serious enough to seek \nmedical treatment. Feelings often can ignored include \nanger, fear, love, happiness, sadness, guilt shame, \nloneliness. Emotions include pride, jealousy, anxiety, \nresentment, envy, frustration, joy, regret nAccording to the National Institute of Mental Health, \nsymptoms of depression include the following: \n Difficulty concentrating, remembering details, and \nmaking decisions \n• Fatigue and decreased energy \n Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, and/or helplessness \n• Feelings of hopelessness and/or pessimism \n Insomnia, early-morning wakefulness, or excessive \nsleeping \n• Irritability, restlessness \n• Loss of interest in activities or hobbies once \npleasurable, including physical intimacy \n• Overeating or appetite loss \n Persistent aches or pains, headaches, cramps, or \ndigestive problems that do not ease even with treatment \n Persistent sad, anxious, or "empty" feelings \n• Thoughts of suicide, suicide attempts \nThe following information is included in the rehabilitation \nprogram for treating and curing depression based on the \nFOFR being the cause of mental illness: \na the symptoms \n• Talk therapy to improve awareness of and reconnect \nwith feelings and emotions \nb depression: Ignoring messages from the \nsubconscious including hunches, feelings, emotions and \nother messages which causes the brain to change the brains \nchemistry causes many unpredictable behavior conditions. \nc Duration of time to acquire depression: Several years \nd Cure: Rehabilitation: Removal from existing lifestyle for \nat least 3 years. Changes to lifestyle that eliminates the \nthreats that the hypothalamus/thalamus determines to be a \nthreat \nt Good \ng depression prior to arrival in space: \n• Insensitivity to feelings and emotions \n• Unawareness for what feelings and emotions are for \n• The unawareness that the subconscious uses feeling, \nemotions, thoughts and hunches to communicate with \nthe conscious mind. \nIX. ANXIETY \nAnxiety is a serious medical illness, which affects a large \nnumber of people. It occurs often and is related to the \nmodern lifestyle that requires people to be exposed \ncontinuously to threatening people, places and activities \nsimultaneously on a long term, continuous basis. Anxiety is \none of many messages from the subconscious mind to the \nconscious mind that people describe as experiencing a \nfeeing or an emotion. Anxiety may be accompanied with \nfeelings or beliefs that their life is in immediate danger, out­\nof-control or are helpless or powerless to make changes in a \nsituation. \nAs a survival mechanism by the subconscious, anxiety \ndisorders are a result of the subconscious' independent \ndetermination that immediate danger or death exists from \npeople, places and activities simultaneously that greatly \nthreatens the person's life and the person has ignored other \nmessages with the same information in the past regularly. \nThe subconscious mind wants the conscious mind to know \nthat danger and the potential for death has been identified by \nthe subconscious. The subconscious does this by causing \nanxiety to be experienced by a person and wanting the \nperson to take action and run away from the danger. \nUnfortunately, it is extremely difficult for people to take the \nright action. \nThere are several recognized types of anxiety disorders \nincluding panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder \n\(COD post-traumatic stress disorder \(PTSD 


ndisorder . \nThe following information is based on the FOFR as the \ncause and cure of anxiety disorders: \na Common treatments of the symptoms: \n• Pharmacology for symptoms \n• Talk therapy to become aware of and reconnect \nwith feelings and emotions from the subconscious.3 \nb emotions and \nother messages from FOFRlhypothalamus and subconscious \ncausing chemical brain imbalance and unpredictable \nbehavior changes. \nc recover from depression: Twice the duration \nto acquire it. \ne lifestyle for \nat least 3 years. Changes to lifestyle that eliminates the \nthreats that the hypothalamus/thalamus determines to be a \nthreat \nt nimproving the long-term relationship between the \nsubconscious and conscious mind and understanding how \nthey communicate. \ng thalamus/hypothalamus to \nits pre-damaged condition, must rely on the natural healing \nby the body. \nh Required work to recover: High. The many years of \ndamage to the thalamus and hypothalamus because of nexposure to the harmful chemicals released by the FOFR \nrequires some changes in lifestyle that are often severe for \nmost people to make. Thus, most people will live with \nanxiety and use the medications to relieve relief from the \nsymptoms rather than adopt the right lifestyle their FOFR \ndemands to stop the progression of the mental illness to \neven more severe behavior changes including suicide. \nX. THE SENSORY INPUT TO THE FOFR nThe sources of the known sensory inputs into the fight-or­\nfight response/thalamus are the ears \(sound light pressure/pain odor temperature, \npressure equivalent to a \nchannel of analog information. This means that if the \nanalog input data were converted to digital telemetry, the \nFOFRlthalamus is receiving about 1 00 GB/S of input data \nfrom each channel of information continuously during \nwaking hours. \nThe sensory input to the subconscious and conscious is far nless during sleep and so data processing decreases allowing \nthe brain to slow down and recover from the day's work \nduring sleep. The FOFR and thalamus and hypothalamus \narea of the brain continues to monitor all the data inputs for \nthreats and remains ready to initiate any action necessary for \nself-preservation. \n12 nXI. THE COMMUNICATIONS BANDWIDTH \nBETWEEN THE SUBCONSCIOUS AND THE \nCONSCIOUS \nUsing feelings, hunches and emotions to communicate from \nthe subconscious to the conscious mind, the information \ninput to the conscious mind from the subconscious mind is \nsignificantly less than the sensory input into the FOFR \nsubsystem. The conscious mind would be easily overloaded \nif it received all the information that the FOFR subsystem nreceived from a person's eyes, ears, nervous system and \nskin and nose. \nThe communications capability between the conscious and \nsubconscious mind is close to zero and this is the reason that \nthe external sensory inputs such as ears, eyes and nose, to \nthe subconscious mind must be used to communicate with \nthe subconscious mind by the conscious mind even though \nboth reside in the same brain. It is confusing to understand \nthat the conscious thoughts are not accessible to the \nsubconscious mind, but they are not. Data exists that the \ncommunications between the subconscious and conscious \nmind is one way thus forcing the conscious mind to use the \nsame communication channels that are used by the \nsubconscious for receiving all other information. \nXII. How PREDICTIVE ALGORITHMS PROCESS \nINFORMATION FOR PREDICTING MENTAL ILLNESS \nFigure 21 is the prognostic analysis that was completed on \nthree NASA EUVE satellite rate-gyros used for attitude ncontrol, pointing and reorienting of the NASA Extreme \nUltra-Violet Explorer \(EUVE orbiting \nspace science satellite. The behavior in the data in Figure 2 1  \nfor Gyro B was missed by the engineering analysis that was \ncompleted by the gyro vendor's manufacturing engineers. \nThe duration of time that the equipment telemetry spanned \nin the prognostic analysis in Figure 2 1  is equivalent to that \nof a prelaunch readiness, launch and 30  days of on-orbit \nhistory for a human space flight program. The prognostic nanalysis used the NASA EUVE gyro motor current. All \nthree rate-gyros were operating simultaneously for nredundancy purposes, only two gyros were needed \nfunctionally. The NRTE \(accelerated aging nGyro B telemetry motor current was processed using \nproprietary predictive algorithms. [ 16] \nPredictive algorithms demodulate telemetry behavior from \nthe measurements in time, amplitude, frequency and phase. \nThe demodulation process illustrates the presence of non­\nrepeatable changes that are usually overlooked and nmisdiagnosed as systemic noise from completely normal \nappearing and normal behaving people or systems nFigure 2 1 .

WHAT IS A THREAT, STRESS, STRESSORS \nAND TRIGGERS \nThese terms need to be defined because they often used \nincorrectly. A threat to the FOFRIhypothalamus/thalamus is ndefined only by the a person's thalamus/hypothalamus and \nis believed to include such events as a dangerous animal \nready to strike, a person attempting to strike someone, a \nperson with a gun that may fire the gun to cause harm. \nStress is the response of the body when the FOFR is \nactivated when the thalamus/hypothalamus recognizes that a \nthreat as defined by the FOFR is present. Early indicators \nthat the FOFR has been activated include: hay \nfever/allergies, canker sores in and around the mouth and \ntongue, chapped lips heartburn, hemorrhoids \(inflamed \nrectum fellow employees, a bully at school, a failing grade \non a test, an angry fried, deadlines, homework, tests nmidterms and finals. \nTriggers are events, places, people, behavior or items that \nevoke a psychological behavior or reaction. Triggers are \nunique and identified only by a person's \nFOFRIthalamus/hypothalamus as a threat. The body \nresponds with a faster heartbeat, faster breathing, \nperspiration and increased blood pressure as well as \npsychological and/or emotional responses. \nXIV.

The Different Rates of Degradation for the \nBrains Subsystems caused by the Chemicals Released by \nthe FOFR Eventually Resulting in Mental Illness. \nThis different rate of degradation for the brain's subsystems \n\(see Figure 23 released by the FOFR long-term is the basis for \nthe application and usability of the prognostic and health nmanagement program to predict and prevent mental illness. \nAs the brain's subsystems degrade in perfonnance their \nfunctionality changes and this change in functionality is \nillustrated in telemetry, using predictive algorithms in a \nPHM \(see Figure 2 1 detennining if an offset \nor non-repeatable transient event \(a.k.a. accelerated aging personnel on board space exploration missions \nby comparing a person's baseline circadian and ultradian nrhythms behavior and real-time circadian and ultradian \nrhythms. If either or both exists, it means that the nFOFRIthalamus is degraded by the harsh chemicals of the \nFOFR and the thalamus will continue to degrade in nperformance enough to cause mental illness in the near \nfuture. \nPredictive algorithms require information from the inside of \nthe active part of a system. Fortunately, the part of the brain \nthat controls circadian rhythms resides next to the thalamus \nand hypothalamus and the behavior that is controlled by the \ncircadian rhythm proved the information to be processed \nusing predictive algorithms. So when the thalamus and nhypothalamus are damaged from the harsh chemicals from \nthe FOFR, the part of the brain that controls the circadian \nrhythms is also damaged due to its location near the \nthalamus and hypothalamus \(see Figure 25 the damage \nis identifiable by using predictive algorithms to process the \n14  \nmeasurements from the body that experience circadian \nrhythm. \nFigure 25. The Location in the Brain where Circadian \nand Ultranian Rhythms Originate Near the Thalamus \nand Hypothalamus that Create the FOFR that are \nDamaged from Long Term Exposure to Cortisol and \nAdrenaline. \n[191Almost every function in the human body exhibits a \ncircadian rhythm and major changes to these rhythms can be \nused to predict mental illness. In ambulatory conditions nenvironmental factors and physical exertion can obscure or \nenhance the expressed rhythms. The three most commonly \nmonitored vital signs are blood pressure \(systolic and \ndiastolic Because these \nvariables exhibit daily rhythms, their normal values vary \nwith the time of day. \nTable 3 shows the normative ranges for these variables. \nCircadian rhythms are produced by natural factors within \nthe body 


but they are also affected by signals from the \nenvironment. Light is the main cue that triggers circadian nrhythms, and turning light on or turning light off trigger the \ngenes that control an organism's internal clocks. Circadian \nrhythms are physical, mental and behavioral changes that \nfollow an approximate 24-hour cycle, responding primarily \nto the light and darkness in a person's immediate \nenvironment. They are found in people, most living things, \nincluding animals, plants and many tiny microbes. \nCircadian rhythms change sleep-wake cycles, hormone \nrelease, body temperature and other important bodily \nfunctions. Researchers have already identified the genes that \ndirect circadian rhythms in people, fruit flies, mice, fungi \nand several other model organisms. \nCircadian rhythms determine many human behavioral \npatterns.[201 The body's master clock controls the production \nof melatonin, a honnone for sleep. The area of the brain that \ncreates circadian rhythms is located just above the optic \nnerves, which relay infonnation about the incoming light to nthe eyes. When there is less light-like at night-the area \ntells the brain to make more melatonin so a person gets \ndrowsy. Ultradian rhythms are events in the body that are \nrepeated throughout a 24-hour circadian day In contrast, \ninfradian rhythms, are events such as the human menstrual \ncycle, have period longer than a day nTable 3.

A continuum exists from the \nmolecular genetics, through the cellular and neuroendocrine \nto the behavioral and psychosocial levels. The ultradian \nrhythms have far-reaching consequences for our \nunderstanding of human physiological and mental health \nand disease. Some ultradian cycling of the body include \nhormonal release, heart rate, thermoregulation, urination, \nbowel activity nostril dilation and appetite. The last \ninvolves rhythmic release of Neuropeptide Y \(NPY nCorticotropin-releasing hormone \(CRR by recognizing the presence \nof changes to the circadian rhythms that are caused by the \nlack of the following items in a person's  life. Mental illness \ncan be cured by having the same factors prominent in a \nperson's life. The healing of the brain can be increased by \nthinking of the brain as a part of the physical body.

This is because the \ntime in preparation may be very low while the time in space \nmay be very long. If the preparation period will be less than \nseveral weeks then sampling frequency should be ncontinuous or as continuous as feasible . If the preparation \nperiod for launch will occur over many weeks then the \nsampling frequency can be reduced to once/hour. \nIn general, the shorter the preparation time for launch the \nhigher the data sampling frequency is required. Preferably, \nprelaunch activity biological diagnostic data should be \nrecorded continuously and the data available for merging \nwith launch and on-orbit data. After a person initially \narrives in space, the sampling frequency should be \ncontinuous or near continuous . After the person has been in \nspace for several weeks, the sampling frequency can be \nreduced to once/hour. If a person is in space for several \nmonths, the sampling frequency can be reduced to as little \nas once/6 hours . \nTable 2.

CONCLUSION \nA prognostic and health management \(PHM industry telemetry to collect, store and distribute \nto remote locations the biological, diagnostic information \nfor process for predicting mental illness using with \npredictive algorithms .  The predictive algorithms are often \nproprietary and must be developed for use with aerospace \ntelemetry to compensate for the many shortcomings and \ncomplexities of CCSDS telemetry to be accurate and \nreliable. Our proprietary predictive algorithms were \npioneered on the Air Force's GPS satellites and Atlas launch \nvehicles over 30 years ago. They have also been \nsuccessfully used on other military, NASA and commercial \nsatellites, launch vehicles and missiles to illustrate the \npresence of accelerated aging in normal appearing \nequipment telemetry from completely normal behaving \nequipment. \nA behavior of a person ' s  FOFR can explain the cause ntreatment and the cure for mental illness .  The chemicals \n1 8  \nreleased by the FOFR when activated were developed by the \nFOFR to be in the body an extremely short duration. \nToday's  lifestyle has forced people to remain in threatening \nsituations forcing the presence of the toxic chemicals used \nby the FOFR for self preservation to be present for many \nyears at varying levels. The chemicals released by the FOFR \nand release of chemicals that are created as a result of the \nrelease of adrenaline and cortisol cause accelerated aging on \nthe entire body including all areas of the brain. When the \nFOFR is damaged from accelerated aging, it forces the \nbrain 's  chemistry to be altered by changing the ratios of \nthree main chemicals very, causing mental illness .  All the \nmedications used in mental health treat only the symptoms \nof mental illness and do not cure it. \nThe identification of accelerated aging in biological, \ndiagnostic telemetry can be used by ground personnel to \npredict the mental illness in personnel to be used for deep \nspace missions. The model of the brain' s  FOFR subsystem \nprovides the information necessary for the ground crew to \npredict and thus prevent mental illness from occurring by \nmaking the changes to the person ' s  environment. The PHM \nuses information obtained from a variety of mission phases \nincluding pre-launch readiness, launch and during deep nspace travel to develop baseline behavior from which \nmental illness can predicted so it can be prevented nREFERENCES \n[ 1 ] .

specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
