Investigation of route choice behaviour in passenger transport  Adam TOROK*, Ferenc MESZAROS Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Budapest, Hungary atorok@kgazd.bme.hu  fmeszaros@kgazd.bme.hu     Abstract The continually increasing population, the rising economic activity and the permanent race for the rise of economic prosperity, led us to the increase of motorisation Transportation sector has an important role, because it is not only using the lacking fossil energy sources and polluting the environment, but because of our social and 
economic structure it is the sector that can hardly change because of the big social resistance. One of the substantial preconditions for the change into an environmental friendly sustainable system is correct data provision to the regulator quality and quantity as well\. One way for reduction of transport related environmental pollution is to give right price signal to the users with internalisation of transport related external costs. In our article we tried to examine the route choice behaviour in Hungary focusing on toll roads Our aim in this paper is to analyze the correlation of control possibilities of such econometric phenomena with mathematic tools I  
I NTRODUCTION  One of the most striking characteristics of the 20th century was the emergence of the automobile for passenger transportation. There are over 700 million of these vehicles in circulation today around the world, the great majority of them with Otto cycle engines running on gasoline. Automobiles are an integral part of everyday life of developed society. They shaped the whole transportation system of mankind and represent a very significant fraction of the GDP of many countries. As developing countries grow and expand, the number of automobiles in the world will increase [1 Th e n u m b e r o f  vehicles per capita is filling up in industrialized countries 
but is much smaller in today\222s developing countries. In China there are only 20 automobiles per 1000 people compared to 700 per 1000 people in the United States of America. In Hungary we had 300 passenger cars for 1000 people in 2006 The consumption of gasoline necessary to run these automobiles is roughly 20 million barrels of crude oil equivalent per day, one quarter of the world petroleum consumption from which it is produced and unfortunately, petroleum is found in relatively few regions of the world. Exports and imports of this commodity are the most important items in international trade, and many countries are critically dependent on petroleum imports 
The current mobility behaviour of population is in need of change towards a sustainable transportation system with better utilisation of alternatives. This leads to lower dependency on fossil fuels and reduced harmful emission Our aim was to analyze the application of road toll measure and the control possibilities of travellers in route and transportation mode choice with elasticity calculations, furthermore to model the modal and route choice as human behaviour II  S ITUATION OF THEORETICAL INVESTIGATION  Let us assume that there are two different routes \(as a part of a graph\n the road network. One with high 
capacity and high service level offered \(interurban expressway\, another one with low capacity and low service level \(trunk road crossing cities and towns\ \226 see Fig. 1. Basic situation is that both routes are free of charge for the users. First we introduce a standard toll system vignette system for example - taking into consideration on the wear and tear costs\ on the road with high capacity and service level. Consumer responses to changes in mobility prices are often measured by elasticity. When the price of road transportation has been changed, the utility function of travellers consequently has been also changed Higher transport prices affect demand for transport 
through two main channels. At first, consumers respond by changing their route and secondly, they change their mode of mobility. In our case those people who need to reach the destination in limited time period, has a higher value of \(travel\ time will pay the toll [2  T h o s e w h o  want to reach the destination with small expenses will choose the road with lower capacity and lower service level, free from any tolls   Figure 1. Investigated area Budapest - Gy r source: www.googlemaps.com   In macroeconomical sense we modelled the decision 
about route choice. We tried to build up a model based on utility functions and analyze the results. Practical uses of supply and demand analysis often centre on the different variables that change equilibrium price and quantity represented as shifts in the respective curves \(Fig 2.\ In the literature both affine and nonlinear approximations of the demand and supply curves are in use.

Change of supply curve [3  We had an unwanted left-ward shift in supply that decreased quantity. With increasing of road toll the traffic is decreasing so even higher service level has been reached. Due to the increased paying obligations, less people want to travel on the higher service level road and part of the traffic is diverted to the free of charge route. In the diagram, this increases the equilibrium price from P 1  to the higher P 2 and lower the traffic from the Q 1 to the Q 2  value. The lower service level road runs through cities and towns. The increased traffic volume on lower service level road causes substantial damage in the infrastructure and environment to the cities and citizens. To lower the caused damage with social cost, the traffic volume is in need to be lowered. For this reason, a diverse distance based tolling should be introduced also on this road internalizing of externalities with focusing on the polluter pays principle, to ensure that the diverted traffic turns back to the high service level road. After  introducing the distance based toll regimes on both routes, the road transportation becomes more expensive, so some people will shift to public transportation modes, so traffic volume on the road will be less.

The traffic characteristics of an existing transport relation are being shaped during years 5 The topic of this point is the revealing analysis of the vehicular relations connecting Budapest and Gyor, building on the traffic data for year 2006. For the internalisation of externalities 226 at least the environmental part - this reason we divided the vehicle fleet by environmental categories \(EURO1 and below, EURO2, EURO3, EURO4, and EURO5 and better\d we categorized them according to cylinder capacity \(up to 1399 cm 3 1400-1999 cm 3 from 2000 cm 3  226 Fig 4\he aim of the group formation is the estimate of the complex environment pollution  Hungarian passanger cars by cylinder capacity 0 500 000 1 000 000 1 500 000 2 000 000 2 500 000 3 000 000 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 years pi more than 2000 ccm 1400 - 1999 ccm upto 1399 ccm  Figure. 4.

Simulation of different toll strategies source: own research   After simulating the expected value of the vehicle flow we separated three cases. In the first case nothing changed. In the second case we added constant level tolls to the vehicle flow on the M1 motorway and trunk road no. 1, therefore in 2006 static case the passenger flow of train and bus will increase and the passenger flow of road and motorway will decrease. In the third case we examined the set of the traffic and added a diverse tolling measure formed by the complex environmental groups taking into account the cylinder capacity and EURO classification of vehicles, therefore in 2006 diverse case the passenger flow of motorway and road decreased and the passenger flow of train and bus will decrease  The results of the traffic model calculations are summarized and demonstrated in Figure 5  IV  C ONCLUSION  From the point of view of economics the main assumptions of the paper are based on Marshall\222s fundamental model Alfred Marshall: Principles of Economics \(1890  cco rd in g to h i s m o d e l it is a s s u m e d  that the operation of the economy is determined by the 223equilibrium point\224, that is at the price at which the supply is equal to the demand. This paper consist in the application of Marshall\222s principles in a particular field that is in the control of road traffic by properly manipulating the fees to be paid by the various participants of the traffic driving various vehicles grouped according to the environmental categories Motorisation causes perceptible environmental externalities. The locally effective emission that has been taken into account by the EURO environmental categories, and the globally effective one which has been taken into account by the piston displacement. In the course of our experiments we revealed that the standard use of road tolling regime enhances the usage of the roadsystem offering inferior, lower service standards, but this diversion leads lower comfort feeling of citizens living in the neighbourhood. Furthermore, our experiments prove that the present tax- and standard toll-system is coherent anyway with the current tolling legislation\ neither with the EU\222s traffic- and environmental policy, nor with the present governing principles of the European Union Reducing greenhouse gas emission will cost money from the states and the society, but the amounts required are clearly affordable. It is important to remember that climate policies can bring many win-win benefits Reforming and diversification of pricing systems will have to be one of the international community\222s top priorities over the coming decades to reach the desirable SAMI 2010 € 8th IEEE International Symposium on Applied Machine Intellig\ence and Informatics € January 28-30, 2010 € Herl'any, Slovakia 127  t,2 p 1t,2 p

strengthen as time progresses. Accounting for time, we hypothesize H3b: Tenure moderates the relationship between commitment and favorable user behavior in a way that members who have longer tenure with community show a higher level favorable user behavior, if they are more committed than members who are new to the community Satisfaction is an ex post evaluation of member experience with the community. Researchers describe it as a positive feeling, indifference or a negative feeling [2]. Most satisfaction definitions in literature focus on the evaluation of single transactions or exchanges [e.g., 37]. However, we follow the approach by Anderson, Fornell and Lehmann [1] and define satisfaction in this study as an overall evaluation based on the experience with a service over time. This cumulative perspective to customer satisfaction is measured with a multi-dimensional construct [e.g., 6 covering various aspects of satisfaction with the community. Hereby, it is mainly directed at the community provider and the technical platform per se Satisfaction in general is said to be positively related to service usage [7]. Users of online communities adapt their participation level in the community by maximizing their subjective utility obtained from the virtual community [8]. Therefore, a high level of satisfaction should lead to a high level of participation \(content should also increase the intention to stay \(loyalty willingness to promote the community to other people growth revenue H4: Satisfaction is positively related to favorable user behavior  3. Methodology  To receive meaningful results for our exploratory research questions, we settled for a quantitative research strategy. In our context we supplemented the data from the online survey with observational data from the logfiles of the game provider  3.1. Sample and Procedure  The MMOG community Travian evolves around a browser-based online game with more than 3.3 million users playing in the beginning of 2008. The game itself is a real-time strategy game \(RTS chieftains of their own villages and seek to gain natural resources, build armies and expand their realms. The game is timed to last approximately one year. Each Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 3 server is a closed game environment and holds approx 25,000 users on maximum In March 2007, we conducted a survey on one of the German servers. Moreover, we were able to obtain the logfiles of the players since they entered the game Of the 17,495 users playing Travian on our selected German world, 1,895 filled out our survey. Deleting those records which included missing values or outliers left us with 1,389 records. Of these, we were able to match each record with the data of the logfiles The average age of users playing Travian is 21.8 ranging from 12 to 50. Of these users, a share of 24 is female. The lion's share of users is currently engaged in education \(67 employed or self-employed. 5% of the users are not working e.g. being unemployed. The dispensable income per month is 211 Euros on average \(see 


Appendix 1  3.2. Measures  Dependent Variable. Ratings of the four dimensions of favorable user behavior were obtained from the user survey. Content was assessed by a single item, asking the users how often they write articles in the community forum. For this, we used a five-point Likert-type scale ranging from -2 to 2 with anchors of never? and ?always?. Revenue was measured with a single item on a five-point Likert-type scale ranging from -2 to 2 by asking the users how often they are paying fees for extra services in the game. Again, the anchors of the scale were ?never? and ?always Loyalty was measured with a single item by asking for the users' intention to stay in the game. It was assessed by a five-point Likert-type scale ranging from -2 to 2 with anchors of ?absolutely not? and ?absolutely Growth was operationalized by a single item asking the users if they would to recommend Travian to other people. It was measured with a five-point Likert-type scale ranging from -2 to 2 with anchors of ?absolutely not? and ?absolutely Independent Variables. Cross-over with offline social networks was measured by the number of fellow Travian players a user also knows in his or her offline life. Commitment was assessed by a single item, asking the users whether they felt committed to the community. For this, we used a five-point Likert-type scale ranging from -2 to 2 with anchors of ?absolutely not? and ?absolutely?. Tenure indicates how long the user has been a member of the game. We obtained this variable through matching the logfiles of the server to the survey data. Satisfaction is an aggregated measure of four items asking users about their level of satisfaction with Travian. The single items were whether they felt enough support from the community whether  the community fulfilled their expectations whether there was a good atmosphere in the community, and whether they were satisfied with the community in general. Again, we applied a five-point Likert-type scale ranging from -2 to 2 with anchors of absolutely not? and ?absolutely? for each scale point This measure showed good reliability with a Cronbach?s ? of 0.86 Control Variables. We controlled for Age, Gender Currently not working \(employment status in education \(pupils, student, etc achieved \(highest educational achievement active internet usage was measured by the extent to which users participate in online chats, online communities and forums/newsgroups. This was measured on a five-point Likert-type scale ranging from -2 to 2 with anchors of ?never? and ?always Hours online was assessed by the number of hours the users were logged in into the community each day Dispensable income was measured by asking each user for the amount of money they had available for their hobbies each month. The willingness to pay reflects the general willingness of the users to pay for online games and was measured by asking whether they spend money on online games. This was assessed on a five-point Likert-type scale ranging from -2 to 2 with anchors of ?never? and ?always  3.3. Analyses  Table A1 in the appendix provides bivariate correlation coefficients. We also checked our data for multicollinearity and computed variance inflation factors \(VIF 


factors \(VIF a problem since none of the VIF values exceeded 10 26]. Moreover, the large size of our sample allows the estimation method we applied to provide robust coefficient estimates To estimate our model, we applied simultaneous estimation of a system of structural regression equations via three-stage least squares \(simultaneousequation models allowed us to answer a set of interrelated research questions in a single, systematic, and comprehensive analysis and to account for the potential interdependencies among our four success dimensions Ignoring simultaneity would lead to biased coefficients 23]. Simultaneous-equation models are conceptually related to so-called Structural Equation Modelling SEM relationships among multiple independent and dependent constructs. Applying a technology acceptance model to an e-commerce adoption setting Gefen et al. [22] showed that linear regression techniques and SEM result in consistent and Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 4 remarkably similar results. However, SEM is usually employed when latent variables are to be addressed [5 With this paper, this is not the case. Obviously, several of our constructs could also been conceptualized as latent variables. However, we confined ourselves to using proxying variables. Moreover, when using statistical software such as LISREL in order to employ SEMs, researchers usually aim at analyzing the overall model fit [22]. Since the objective of this analysis is to solely analyze the effects between independent and dependent variables, we deem regression-based simultaneous-equation models as the adequate method Table 2.

Firstly, instead of using simultaneous estimation techniques, we estimated the four equations depicted in Table 2 independently using OLS. These results have been fairly consistent with those reported in Table 2. Secondly, recall that our dependent variable has been surveyed applying a Likert-type scale Accordingly, these variables are censored Consequently, we also estimated four independent Tobit regressions which account for this characteristic of the dependent variable. By employing OLS or Tobit regression techniques, an equi-distant measure is assumed to operationalize the dependent variable Third, to provide additional robustness of our model we also estimated four independent ordered probit models. Since the results did not change in a major way, they have been omitted here  3.4. Results  Table 2 reports the estimation results of our simultaneous-equation model including four equations with contant, revenue, loyaty and growth as dependent variables. According to hypothesis H1, we expected the cross-over between online and offline social networks to be positively related with favorable user behavior. Indeed, cross-over with offline social networks is positively significant with most of our dependent variables. The larger the cross-over, the higher users? production of content \(0.039 with p 0.01 dependent variable.

With the exception of loyalty, we can confirm our hypothesis H1. H2 hypothesized that commitment to the community is positively related to favorable user behavior. With content, the coefficient is positive and significant \(0.291 with p ? 0.01 commitment is positively associated with content production. This is not true for revenue. Here commitment is not significantly related. Viewing loyalty as dependent variable, a positive and significant effect can be observed \(0.130 with p ? 0.01 


effect can be observed \(0.130 with p ? 0.01 is true with growth \(0.101 with p ? 0.01 commitment is associated with a higher loyalty and a higher propensity to recommend the game to others Again, with one exception, we can confirm H2. In H3a we hypothesized that the time spent in the community tenure Here, the number of weeks the user has played the game is positive and significant with content \(0.019 with p ? 0.05 revenue, loyalty and growth as dependent variable are insignificant. Consequently, we are only able to confirm H3a for one of our success dimensions Hypothesis H3b included the interaction of tenure and commitment. None of the models shows a significant effect for this moderating effect. Consequently, we cannot prove tenure to be a moderator of the relationship between commitment and the single success dimensions. Moreover, this relationship appears to be unmoderated. Accordingly, H3b cannot be confirmed at all. In H4, we hypothesized that satisfaction is only partially positively related to favorable user behavior. Satisfaction is not significantly related to content production. Viewing the model with loyalty and growth as dependent variables a positive and significant relation can be observed 0.348 with p ? 0.01 and 0.489 with p ? 0.01 Accordingly, satisfaction is positively related with the intention to remain in the community \(loyalty propensity to recommend the game to others \(growth However, regarding revenue as a dependent variable the coefficient of satisfaction is negatively significant 0.103 with p ? 0.05 with a clear causal effect. On the one hand, more satisfied users might tend to be less willing to pay for extra services or on the other hand it might be possible that payments to the community provider makes users unsatisfied. In all, H4 can only partially be confirmed  4. Conclusion  4.1. Discussion  This study set out to explore the influence of crossover between online and offline social networks membership tenure, satisfaction and commitment on favorable user behavior. As favorable user behavior we identified four major categories that drive community success: content \(creation of content by users willingness to pay for extra services loyalty \(intention to remain in the community growth \(propensity to recommend the community to other users online and offline networks would exhibit more favorable behavior than users with no cross-over. We further argued that a higher level of satisfaction with the community would lead to higher levels of favorable behavior. We also hypothesized that higher levels of commitment would lead to higher levels of favorable behavior. We further argued that the relationship Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 between commitment and favorable behavior would be moderated by membership tenure. Therefore, our study sheds light on the influence of user behavior on the success of online communities We found that the cross-over between online and offline social networks had a significant influence on three of the four user behaviors. Only loyalty was not influenced. This could be because in case of a crossover users can still be in touch with some of their online social network when they leave the community 


online social network when they leave the community and therefore do not loose all their ties. As predicted users who have been longer with the community display a higher level of satisfaction than new members. However, membership tenure had no influence on revenue, loyalty or growth. The reason might be that these three dimensions reflect users attitude towards the community which is, of course varying between different types of users and their behaviour but not depending on the time users have spent in the community. Furthermore, we found that satisfaction with the community had a negative influence on the willingness to pay and a positive effect on loyalty and recommendation behavior. No influence could be found on the creation of content This strengthens the argument that the creation of content is separated from the satisfaction with the community and more attached to the other users of the community. Moreover, this study shows that a high level of commitment had a significant impact on three of the four dimensions of favorable user behavior These results demonstrate the importance of a committed user base for the success of an online community. However, the hypotheses that the relationship between commitment and favorable behavior would be moderated by membership tenure could not be supported on any dimension. This is an opposite finding to previous research in other kind of communities [15] and therefore probably takes into account the special nature of a MMOG community Accordingly, commitment indeed influences community success but over time remains largely constant in a MMOG context Considering all the relationships in our framework we observe that all dimensions are influenced by user attributes. However, it should be noted that one of the most important success dimension from a provider?s point of view ? revenue ? was positively related to cross-over only and even negatively related to satisfaction These results bear several important implications for community providers. As we noted in the beginning of the paper, the drivers of a successful community are very hard to determine but there seems to be an overall agreement that the userbase and the underlying user characteristics play a major role. Therefore, favorable user behavior is crucial to the survival of the community. Most importantly we sought to highlight that it is not solely the volume of the userbase that makes a community successful, but, instead, the various attributes of the users within the userbase that drive different factors of success. Success in this context is a multi-faceted construct community providers have to have in mind when setting up and managing their community. Especially the commitment of the users should be fostered at any stage of their membership tenure to ensure that enough content is created within the community. Satisfaction with the community is another critical factor. However the relationship to favorable user behavior is ambivalent and therefore community providers must carefully balance the level of \(dis their platform. Moreover, community providers should encourage the cross-over of online and offline social networks by establishing incentives to pull ones offline friends into the online community. On the other hand community providers might seek to enhance pure online friends to real life contacts in order to increase the overlap between offline and online contacts  4.2. Limitations and future research  


Inevitably, this study has some limitations that have to be taken into account in order to adequately interpret the results and judge their generalizability. First, we employed self-reported measures for several key variables. In some cases \(e.g. willingness to pay sources of data were not available, but there was little reason to expect distortion in self-reporting. In some cases \(e.g. commitment and satisfaction are intrinsically subjective and perceptual; this condition necessitated the use of self-report [49 Second, we gathered data only in a single MMOG community and therefore, some effects could be unique to the specific design of the community Third, this study has been the first to examine different success factors of online communities, but cross-sectional in nature. To analyze the relation between the userbase and community success in greater detail, longitudinal studies using panel data could be of great value. Moreover, Partial Least Squares \(PLS an adequate technique Future research may build upon the results of this study in a number of ways. Extending this study to several MMOG communities and also in different countries could further deepen the understanding of determinants of favorable user behavior. Furthermore the role of membership tenure could be investigated in more detail to deepen our understandingof the user life cycle in a community and the different impact of users Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 characteristics and their behavior in various stages. The ambiguous relationship between favorable user behavior and the level of satisfaction seems particularly noteworthy. It was the only attribute to have both positive and negative relations with our success dimensions. Since most business models of MMOG communities are based on premium memberships, future research should explore the negative relationship between satisfaction and willingness to pay identified in this study more thoroughly In summary, the results of this study provide answers to the antecedents of favorable user behavior in online communities and provide insights into the diverse dimensions of success  5.
