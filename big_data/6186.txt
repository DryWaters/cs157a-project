environmentally sustainable The optimal pumping schedule for a coastal well has been defined by a decision model that minimizes desalination and pumping costs, while taking into account the aquifer salinity levels near the well. The state equations are embedded as constraints in the optimization problem. Pumping is related to salinity via empirical response curve s, through data collected in experimental campaigns. The decision model is defined as a multi-stage optimal control problem which can be solved by applying dynamic programming. The architecture of a Decision Support 
System \(DSS\ real time im plementation in order to minimize costs and salinity increase is reported. A case study is presented with application to a well positioned at Kukièo \(Hawaièi Island, Hawaièi, USA   1. Introduction  Efficient management of coastal water resources is important to satisfy demand, to maintain supplies, and to sustain associated terrestrial and marine ecosystems  2 coas tal zon e s   w h er e th e i n tens i v e ex tractio n of groundwater may upset the balance between freshwater and saltwater potentials, water resource 
managers need to satisfy demand while limiting seawater intrusion and saltwater upconing Seawater intrusion and the related phenomena of saltwater upconing occur when a well, or a set of wells is pumped so that saline water is drawn into the well's capture zone, thus degrading water quality and useable value. Together with recharge, these water quality problems are often the limiting factors to pumping yield in coastal aquifers. The options if a well becomes saline are: \(a\e or stop the rate of pumping 
to allow water quality recovery, for a period which can be on the order of decades to centuries in low permeability aquifers; \(b\alt via a treatment process such as reverse osmosis; or \(c\ abandon the well. Economic and socio-political costs need to be included in any practical model of groundwater management. The challenge is given by the necessity of incorporating both the hydrology and the economics into a realistic, practical and tractable optimization framework. Many excellent models and methodologies for coastal aquifer management exist in the literature 
In e opti m al a n n u a l  operation of a coas tal  aquifer is determined with a multiple objective linear programming approach based on a multi-cell model of the aquifer, where the decision variables are pumping and/or recharge quantities in each cell In e n onli n e ar fin i ted i ff eren ce f o r m of t h e  steady-state density-dependent miscible flow and salt transport model for seawater intrusion is used embedding it within the constraints of the management model. The use of embedding techniques for saltwater

Algorithm-based optimization model. However, the performance of this approach is highly dependent on the performance of the saltwater intrusion simulation model, as repetitive simulations are required to achieve an optimal management strategy. The computational time can be reduced through parallel computing, or by some approximation of the simulation model As regards upconing phenomena in coastal aquifers an increase in pumped water salinity is related to the movement of the transition zone of the saltwater interface towards the pumping well. An excellent survey is given by [6  O f  sp e c i a l no t e a n d r e l e va nc e t o  the presen  w h ic h a v e r y i n teresti ng model of upconing and rebound is described. This work well presents the mechanisms of flow and salt transport for upconing phenomena, the decay/rebound after shut-off of the salinized well, and the effects of parameters on flow and transport processes. A physically-based model is used to derive different curves for upconing effects in case of pumping and well shut-off. Attention is paid to finding pumping policies that may increase the efficiency of freshwater pumping from the aquifer In this paper, the curves for well pumping and shutoff/rebound are derived from experimental campaigns The curves are used to define a state equation for the concentration behavior as a function of a binary control variable that makes the system switch between the two modes of salinity increase/decrease. The aim of this paper is to present a dynamic decision model able to define the optimal pumping trajectories for a coastal brackish water well that minimizes desalination and pumping costs while dynamically keeping track of salinity levels in the well. The possibility of turning on/off the pump has led to the definition of a binary control variable that indicates when the well is turned off or on Due to the suitable data obtained during the experimental campaign at Kuki  o, Hawai   n l i k e  most published models on coastal well optimization pumping is related to salinity via empirical response curves. The pumping curve, which is site-specific and flowrate-specific, is determined by the fitting of data collected for the case study and is used to describe the salinity increase when the binary control variable is set equal to 1. When the binary variable switches to 0 \(i.e there is no pumping in a specific time interval\e rebound curve \(obtained in the same way as the pumping curve during the field experiment\ed to describe the salinity decrease. Then, a discrete-time state equation for salinity concentration in the pumped water can be written, taking into account the effect of a binary switching control variable, on the basis of the curves that describe pumping and rebound behavior for the aquifer. An additional state equation has to be defined in order to represent the dynamics of the cumulative pumped water up to the considered time instant. The performance index to be minimized consists in a weighted sum of economic costs, salt concentration at the end of the time horizon, and water demand dissatisfaction The optimization problem is non-linear with continuous state variables and binary control variables that allow the switching between two different behaviors of the environmental system In this paper, a control-oriented approach is adopted for the case of coastal aquifers affected by saltwater intrusion and upconing phenomena, and feedback strategies are sought. To this end, the application of dynamic programming allows for definition of a procedure to facilitate on-line determination of the optimal control action as a function of the current state For the considered case study, the computational requirements of such a procedure are shown to be compatible with a real-time application  2. The system model  The considered system consists of a single coastal pumping well whose hourly pumping schedule shall be defined, taking into account that a daily water demand should be fulfilled and salinity of the well minimized Time is discretized, being the length of the unit time interval equal to one hour. An optimization horizon of N 24 hours is considered because of the daily water demand that has to be satisfied. A binary control variable k u is defined equal to 1 in case the pump is on during the k-th hour interval k=0 N-1 d 0 otherwise. Two state equations must be written: the cumulative pumped water state equation and the concentration state equation  2.1 Cumulative pumped water state equation  A state equation is needed to define the cumulative amount of water pumped over the daily time horizon This is critical to the cost function, which weights the deviation of the overall pumped water from the daily water demand The equation is complicated by the fact that the brackish water has to be des alted prior to use.  Due to inefficiencies in the treatment \(reverse osmosis process, the higher the pumped water salinity is the greater the losses of water volume due to the treatment process. This "by-pass inefficiency" effects an increase in the amount of total water pumped with respect to the actual water demand.  That is, the pumped water useful to satisfy the daily water demand decreases as the salinity increases. This may be modelled by assuming Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 2 


that the overall \(useful\ped water, at each hour k  is reduced \(with respect to the actually pumped water by a factor  C C E k  where E is a dimensionless parameter k C is the state variable \(concentration at time k d C  is a fixed reference concentration 1 The reference concentration is site specific and it is typically set at the maximum salinity that would be expected to encounter at the site. The values of such parameters are such that, for any possible value of C k  the factor C C E k  is less than or equal to 1. Thus, the following equation can be used in order to represent the dynamics of P k+1  n C C E Q u P P k k k k      1 1  k=0 N-1 1  where k P is the cumulative pumped water at time k  m 3  Q is the well pumping rate [m 3 s 1  n is the number of seconds in a hour, and P 0 0  2.2 Concentration state equation  To introduce the second state equation, it is necessary to characterize the system behaviour. This characterization is not based, in the present paper, on a physically-based model, but on two experimentally obtained functions \(hereinafter referred to as pumping and rebound curves\hese functions result from the interpolation of the data gathered during observation campaigns at the considered site. The curves obtained represent the behaviour of the salt concentration at the considered site, when the well is subject to a constant control, i.e., pumping 1  k u bound 0  k u  k 0, 1, 2 From these empirical functions, both the increment   1 k C f and the decrement   2 k C f of the salt concentration can be obtained during the k-th time interval \(e.g. one hour in the case study\ when the pump is on or off, respectively. Note that this increment \(or decrement\s in any case a function of the current concentration C k Hence, the second state equation may be written as   k k k k k k u C f u C f C C      1     2 1 1    1 Permeate/System recovery rate is affected by many factors such as membrane performance, temperature, and feed pressure. These factors affect energy consumption and hence system economics. The formulation presented here simplifies what is a complicated optimization problem in itself.  For more background on these processes see, for instance, www.membranes.com   k=0 N-1 2  Based on the empirical curves generated at Kuki o and curves noted in work such as f u n c tion to  represent the increase in salt concentration over continuous time  i.e. the pumping curve, is defined as        p p b a s g C 0   3 where 0 s  p b  p a are parameters that result from an experimental data fitting, and s 0 is the salinity at the beginning of the data campaign. From this curve, one can obtain the inverse function k p p p k k C a s b s b C C g       0 0 1    On this basis, the concentration increment   1 k C f during a unit time interval in the pumping mode, can be written as k k p k p k k k C C g b C g a s C g g C g g C f              1    1        1      1 1 0 1 1 1 4 and, using the expression of   1 k C g  as  k k k k C C b a C d e C f     1 1 1 1 1    5 where 0 1 s a a b a p p p    1 1   b  0 1 s a a b d p p p     2 2 0 0 1 2 p p a s s a e     Similar considerations can be made as regards the term   2 k C f In fact, the rebound curve can be represented as       R R R b b a s h C 0    6 where 0  s  R b  R a are parameters that result from experimental data fitting From this curve, one can obtain the inverse function   1 k C h    namely R k R R k b s C b a C h     0 1    Thus  2 k C f can be written as  1      1         1 0 1 1 2            k R R k k k k C h b ab s C C h h C h h C f 7 and, using the expression of   1 k C h  as Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 3

The optimization problem   The performance index to be minimized is the weighted sum of three contributions: pumping and desalination costs, final salt concentration, and quadratic\iation of the overall actual available water with respect to the total water demand The first contribution is relevant to the energy cost to pump water from depth and the additional energy cost to desalinate. Energy cost for pumping depends on the specific energy schedule, pumping rate, and depth to the water table. Desalination energy cost depends primarily on the pressure needed to drive the reverse osmosis process, which, in turn, depends on the salinity of pumped water. Moreover, due to the treatment plant inefficiency, a larger gross volume of salty water \(as opposed to freshwater\needs to be pumped to meet the water demand. Energy is needed in the treatment plant process \(Reverse Osmosis \(R O\ide additional pressure to force salty water through the RO membrane. This additional desalination pressure may be equated to a depth of water Thus, on the whole, the first contribution can be expressed as  k N k k u C    1 0   9   where    hr ppT d  h param e ter s  depending on unit costs for energy, pumping rate and technical characteristics of the desalination plant \(for further details on the structure of these parameters, s   k C is the salt concentration at the beginning of the k-th hour     k u is the binary control variable indicating whether the pump is on 1  k u off 0  k u  within the time interval k  k 1 The second contribution is simply proportional to the pollutant concentration at the end of the time horizon N  C N  Finally, the last term is proportional to the quadratic difference between the \(useful\ped water at the end of the time horizon P N  m 3  n d t h e w a ter  demand over the overall time horizon Q TOT m 3  at  is  2 TOT N Q P   Thus, the overall objective function \(to be minimized\ is    2 1 0 TOT N N k N k k Q P C u C J            10 where  and  are specific dimensionless weighting coefficients.

Alternatively, if one assumes to make use of on-line measurements of the state variables, it is possible to consider such a problem as an optimal control problem, and to approach it by dynamic programming, in order to find optimal closedloop control strategies  4.

The second approach is advantageous, since a\o continuous decision variable is dealt with b\e special structure of the problem is exploited The application of dynamic programming allows finding optimal control actions at each node, and thus the overall optimum path However, in presence of un-modelled system dynamics and/or stochastic disturbances affecting the system behaviour, the optimization objective should be that of determining \(optimal\ed-loop control strategies instead of \(optimal\control actions  5. The architecture of a DSS for coastal wells optimal pumping schedule  The models described in the previous sections are integrated into a DSS that can be used to schedule the optimal pumping pattern for coastal wells and to control salinity increase. A graphical interface developed in MS Visual Basic 6.0\ be used to modify the parameters and the settings of the optimization problem \(time horizon, initial states weights, parameters for the equations, etc.\n the optimization procedure, and to display the results Specifically, the DSS is characterized by three main modules: a database, in which are stored all parameters for the pumping and rebound curves, unit costs pumping rate, optimization ho rizon; an optimization module that includes the objective function and the optimization procedure; a simulation module, in which the system state equations are expressed as a function of the control variables. The DSS can be flexible to the different exigencies of the users. In particular, it can be used for real time implementation. In fact, the overall optimization problem has a running time that is much less than the time interval \(running time: few minutes time interval: one hour\en, each step has an optimization procedure based on dynamic programming that takes to the final stage and that is expressed as a function of the current state variables concentration, pumped water Thus, the DSS can be used to   daily schedule the pumping pattern on the basis of the initial state conditions   compare the predicted \(by the system models\d the observed state variables   hourly schedule the pumping pattern on the basis of the specific stage and of the initial values of the state variables \(predicted and/or observed   perform a simulation scenario, running the optimization for the desired number of days  6. Application to a case study  The considered case study is relevant to the area of Kuki o, North Kona, Hawai i. The empirical pumping and rebound curves used to build the concentration state equation have been calculated for the study site on the basis of real data collection Shallow basal wells are a large component of potable water supply along the Kona coastline, but, due to the area's unique and highly hydraulically conductive hydrogeology, the basal lens is thin with a relatively thick transition zone. Basal heads range from 0.1 to 2.5 m, with some coastal wells being brackish 200 ppm\en under virgin condition, even though they may be located kilometres inland  Such conditions exist at the three irrigation wells pumped for the study. Initial heads at these three wells average 0.43 m and initial chlorides average 525 ppm All three wells are located at about the 183 m elevation contour and are drilled through young, basaltic rock to approximately 6.1 m below sea level.  The 125 HP U.S. Motors pumps are set at sea-level and generate 2.955 m 3 day \(540 gpm The developers conducted controlled pumping and rebound tests on these wells during January and February 2002. The site's unique hydrogeology provided the opportunity to obtain curves of salinity stress and rebound in a short amount of time For the specific field site \(and a pumping rate of 122.4 m 3 h 1 it was found that salinity rises fairly quickly for the first 24 hours of pumping, but plateaus at about 3.2 ppT after only about 72 hours. For the longest test the pump was on continuously for 7 days and then the pump was turned off and the basal lens allowed to rebound for 7 days. Successful rebound back to initial conditions was achieved in only a week's time. Such quick rebound is surely a result of the region's very high hydraulic conductivity and regional recharge conditions. The fact that the Kuki o well salinity asymptotically approaches a "stable" salinity level is supported by Zh  w h o n o t e o n  the basis of their numerical model, "local upconing occurs only for low iso-salinity surfaces, while those of high salt concentration remain stable after a short time". Differently from the Kuki o in situ experiments Zhou and Bear observe very long times \(~ decades\or Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 5 


salinity decay back to initial conditions in their upconing model. However, Bear et al.\(2001\ind in their model of saltwater intrusion that the decay process may be reversible when the model includes regional flow to the sea, as obviously exists at the field site of Kuki o The experimental methods used at Kuki o may not  be appropriate in low permeability porous media if the well being tested is needed to meet potable demand The quality of one's well could be seriously impaired for a long-period of time. This optimal management methodology is most applicable to high-conductivity aquifers, or to management situations with long-term data and/or reliable models of salinization and rebound The pumping and rebound curves have been obtained via a fitting with hyperbolic-type curves Figure 1 shows collected data for field pumping rate Q  0.034 m 3 s 1 ether with the empirical curves that have been used in this work. Multi-parameter exponential/logarithmic curves have also been found to fit as well. However, the shape of the fitted model is not a matter for the model methodology presented, as it can be easily changed in the proposed approach   Figure 1   Experimental data and fitted pumping and rebound curves for Kuki o pump tests, Jan. 2002 \(field pumping rate Q 0.034 m 3 s 1   As such, pumping and rebound are fit with the twoparameter hyperbolic curves, reported in equations \(3 and \(6\pectively The parameter values reported in Table 1 are found for a pumping rate of Q 0.034 m 3 s 1   Table 1 Parameters values for the pumping and rebound curves  Q 0.034 Pumping Curve  Q 0 Rebound Curve 0 0  s s   2.1 2.1 P a  1.1 R a  1.1 P b  2.5 R b  8  It is assumed that the pumping well rebounds along a single trajectory regardless of the well salinity when the pump is switched off. This is justified on the basis of field results. The well has been turned off at various levels of salinization to test rebound curve sensitivity to initial point of rebound, and in all cases it rebounded along almost identical trajectories. This assumption may be incorrect if critical upconing conditions are encountered and/or at high pumping rates, and this is a subject in need of further experimentation Obviously, the approach based on the use of the empirical response curves should be adopted only in study sites where these equations are available or can be obtained. For the case presented in this article robust, real datasets are used to find a response curve Most places do not have such nice curves that represent reality, so, in these cases, it is necessary to use approximate models. In some cases it would be possible to find model-generated response curves for use in the optimization model framework presented here.

Conclusion and future developments  Environmental systems planning and management is a complex task because of the different aspects to be taken into account and because of the necessity of integrating physical/chemical models into decision models. Finding the appropriate problem formalization to support these actions, solving the optimization problem efficiently,and providing for the possibility to update the information and the model itself, are keypoints for complex systems managers. In coastal aquifers where seawater intrusion occurs, the challenge is given by the necessity of incorporating both the hydrology and the economics into a realistic, practical and tractable optimization framework. This entails simplifying complicated partial differential equations and embedding the relevant economics, while maintaining the model's reliability and physicaleconomic validity The different models \(chemical, physical, economic etc.\ be integrated in a DSS. DSSs are considered effective tools for the environmental planning and management of natural resources \(Matthies et al. [10    This approach should help to define economically and environmentally sustainable strategies for the use of water resources. While other system physical/chemical models may represent the interaction between control variables \(i.e., extracted water, in this case\d the hydraulic head and/or the concentration levels, optimization models like the one presented here are able to define optimal strategies on the basis of the different objectives to be achieved \(minimization of economic costs due to pumping and desalinization groundwater salinity concentration, water demand dissatisfaction\ in order to minimize costs and to preserve the resource The aim of this paper is to present a dynamic decision model to define the optimal pumping trajectories for a coastal, brackish water well that minimizes desalination and pumping costs while dynamically keeping track of salinity levels in the well The possibility of turning on/off a pump has led to the definition of a binary control variable that indicates when the well is turned off or on. Pumping is related to salinity empirically, with actual pumping and rebound curves derived from on-site pump tests at Kuki'o Hawai'i. When the binary variable switches to 0 \(i.e there is no pumping in a specific time interval\e rebound curve \(obtained in the same way as the pumping curve\s used to describe the salinity decrease. A discrete-time state equation for salinity concentration in the pumped water can be written taking into account the effect of a binary switching control variable, on the basis of the curves that describe pumping and rebound behavior for the aquifer. An additional state equation has to be written in order to represent the dynamics of the cumulative pumped water up to the considered time instant. The performance index to be minimized consists in a weighted sum of different objectives: economic costs salt concentration at the end of the time horizon, and daily water demand dissatisfaction Unlike most published models on coastal well optimization, pumping is related to salinity via empirical response curves based on real datasets However, when these curves can not be found from real data, the approach is to find model-generated response curves in the optimization model.

the number of steps\. The advantage of applying dynamic programming instead of standard mathematical programming tools is twofold. First, the special structure of the optimization problem is effectively exploited. Second, no continuous-valued variable has to be taken into account. The computational requirements of the proposed approach have been experimentally evaluated in connection with a real case study, and have been proven to be compatible with a real-time implementation of the procedure Future developments may regard the comparison of results with the use of empirical curves based on complex upconing models \(such as the one formulated by Zhou d th e ex pan s ion of t h es e m odel s  to more wells that influence each other. As regards the proposed methodology, future development may include a generalization of the formalization of the optimal control strategy to more binary variables for each stage, more state equations about the setting time needed by the pump when it is turned on-off, and integer variables instead of binary variables. Then future developments of the presented DSS regard the definition of an Identification module in which the information as regards predicted concentration pumping pattern, observed data can be used to identify models for the system state equations and to update the parameters. Finally, further aspects that can be added include a sensitivity analysis performed by varying the weight s coefficients in the objective function, and the use of other multi-objective approaches   8.

 12 7  C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK  This research task started with an all-FORTRAN implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm converted it to C code, and developed a number of H W/SW systems on the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA The execution ti me of the all software C implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm was recorded and used for comparison as a base case Two software-based optimizations were applied that reduced the executi on time by more than 4.5x These included modifying the cod e to use all single-precision math library functions no n-ANSI when dealing with single-precision data and utilizi ng the IBM Performance Libraries  Perflib  to improve the speed of all single and double-precision arithmetic The idea of using a DP-only Perflib was introduced and then used in conjunction with the single-precision APU-FPU to fu rther improve system performance The bulk of the research dealt with looking into ha rdwarebased improvements to the FTIR spectrometry system  These included the Xilinx APU-FPU, and a single-pre cision dot-product co-processor The APU-FPU delivered significant speedup for all single-precision floati ng-point operations The dot-product co-processor although ineffective in the FTIR spectrometry system due to poor spatial locality of the data, showed nearly a 2x im provement over the APU-FPU when working with smaller, sequent ially accessed data sets Furthermore it was implemented  as a load/store-based APU-connected FCM thus establishin g a reference for creating similar APU co-processors T he design of a non-system-bused CPU-coupled co-process or is frequently overlooked in design guides yet it is a  very effective way to offload software routines to hardw are implementation The ML410 development board on which all of this w ork was conducted, hosts the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA contain ing two PPC405 processors This research task focused o n optimizing the performance of the FTIR spectrometry  algorithm on a single PPC405 core, however, the des ign can be extended to utilize both available cores. Figure 16 on the following page shows a dual-core design that can be  implemented on the ML410 board The two PPC405 processors each have dedicated PLB interfaces but s hare a common OPB. On the common OPB, the processors need to negotiate access to the RS232 UART and SystemACE CF  controller. This negotiation can be done through du al-ported shared BRAM accessible by each processor from thei r respective PLB. The ML410 board has two external me mory interfaces that are both utilized in this concept PPC405 CPU0 uses the DDR2 DIMM 256 Mbytes while PPC405 CPU1 utilizes the DDR on-board component memory 64  Mbytes\. Each of the processors has some dedicated on-chip memory OCM connected through OCM interface The instruction side OCM is particularly necessary so e ach processor can store its own boot code in its own on chip memory as booting both processors from external mem ory may not be possible Both processors have their own FPUs connected on dedicated FCB interfaces Since the processing of individual interferograms is a comple tely independent task an up to 2x reduction in executio n time may be possible with a dual-core system However o ne bottleneck that may limit the speedup is negotiatin g access to the shared CF card controller Additional improvement to the overall performance o f the FTIR spectrometry system may be possible by rewriti ng the software in C. The automatic conversion from FORTRA N to C using f2c most likely does not produce optimal code, and it is certainly not appealing to read Some functio ns may also need to be rewritten with an optimized pattern  of data access This can help in cases such as the dot-prod uct coprocessor Further performance improvement may be achieved by trying a different compiler one that is specifical ly targeted for the embedded PPC405 processor A V2P performanc e study done at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center concluded that using the WindRiver Diab DCC 5.2 com piler provides a 38 performance increase over the GNU-GC C 3.4 compiler The comparison was based on running a  Dhrystone benchmark application on a 400 MHz PPC405 design The GNU-GCC compiler achieved 458 DMIPS while the WindRiver Diab DCC achieved 628 DMIPS as  reported by Xilinx\ [10   Implementing additional hardware co-processors may result in the further reduction of execution time Using t he dotproduct design as a reference the FFT function fo r example can be implemented in the hardware This w ill help in the spectrum computation component of the s oftware processing. It may be necessary to re-arrange the d ata access pattern for optimal co-processor performance to av oid the pitfall seen when deploying the dot-product core Finally, no embedded processing system is complete without an OS. Linux is a good choice and is supported by X ilinx in EDK It is important to first finalize the hardware  design prior to deploying the OS Support for the APU may be lacking in Linux and getting the OS to recognize th e hardware FPU may be a project in itself For the FTIR spectrometry algorithm this research task started the process of moving from an all software system to a mixed HW/SW implementation on the V4FX60 hybridFPGA In the best case a more than 8x speedup was achieved compared to the FTIR base system This implementation, although nearly 2x faster the V2P s ystem at NASA JPL still lags behind the current state-of-th e-art space processor  the BAE RAD750 However the marg in between the two was narrowed down significantly and with further research as suggested above will most lik ely be eliminated altogether Directly benefiting from the  work presented in this paper is a 3-year JPL technology

  16  Figure 15. AIRS-AMSRE differences as a function of AIRS error estimate over one day  AIRS has an error estimate of the total water vapor value that it calculates. The diffe rences between AIRS and AMSR-E are shown as a function of this estimate in figure 15 and very little correlation is found 11  R ELEVANT W ORK  Merged A-Train Level 2 Data A merged product that preserves the relationship of observed atmospheric water properties facilitates the hydrological studies by enabling scientists to get directly at the model data without worrying about the logistics of finding, collecting, and coordinating the measured quantities from different instruments. Previously there did not exist a capability to discover and access data from the A-Train\222s multiple instruments as merged multi-parameter data sets Enabling Orchestratable Service Workflows Our distributed service-oriented approach of loosely coupled services also enable s a higher level of reusability and orchestration with other services. Increasing numbers of workflow engines are already supporting Web Services as components/operators, which can then be orchestrated together into higher-level meta/virtual services SciFlo, a Scientific Dataflow Execution Environment, is a workflow engine that already supports assembling reusable SOAP Services, native execu tables, local command-line scripts, and codes into a distributed computing flow \(a graph of operators\8 SciFlo can u tilize o u r g en eric SOAP services as part of a larger coordinated data flow The Taverna Workbench is a free software tool for designing and executing workflows. Like SciFlo, it can orchestrate SOAP-based Web Services as components within a workflow. Taverna provides a visual editor to construct and edit the sequence of services in the workflow We have found that Taverna can dynamically introspect a given WSDL and construct the workflow component interface representing it Giovanni Giovanni, an acronym for the Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Cent er, or GES DISC, Interactive Online Visualization and Analys is Infrastructure, is a webbased tool to help visualize Earth science data  It  provides a simple and intuitive way to visualize, analyze and access vast amounts of Eart h science remote sensing data without having to download the data. Similar to the services developed here, it addresses the difficulties of traditional data acquisition and analysis methods by moving the complexity to the server-side Giovanni provides multiple in terface instances based on instrument and measurement ty pes. For example, the \223ATrain Along CloudSat Track Inst ance\224 can provide plots of vertical profiles of clouds, temperature, humidity, cloud and aerosol classification across the multiple instruments of the A-Train A distinction between Givanni\222s A-Train data and the data set in this paper is that we are using a formal merged product of the A-Train. We leverage the NEWS effort that is based on error- and resolution-weighted mean of the input data sets, with associated uncertainty estimates. This provides a formal model of the collective A-Train observations rather than the collection of the individual instrument measurements Each of Giovanni\222s multiple interface instances provides a very simple and easy to use web interface. However, we recognized that sometimes scientists want more than the simple interfaces. Some scien tists may want to process Level 3 products using their own trusted code, or may want to perform variations of their own plots. With Giovanni, the individual scientist wanting more custom advanced capabilities must depend on the Giovanni development team Giovanni is based on the web portal paradigm where users visit a web page and use web tools to find and visualize data. Similar to Giovanni, our client APIs also make data acquisition more seamless. However, our services are based on the different paradigm were the power and flexibility of data analysis and processing are shifted back into the scientists own familiar computing environments. We realize that scientists generally want to perform \223exploratory computing\224 where they can sere ndipitously analyze the data using their own familiar and trusted code 


  17 Giovanni 2 was inherently synchronous where processing was bounded to a single http session. Long service running times still require the user to hold the same http session Similar to our asynchronous Web Service we discussed, the upcoming Giovanni 3 will be supporting asynchronous sessions. They will be using a RSS feed to monitor the service request. Version 3 will also be based on a servicesoriented architecture, wher e Giovanni services can be offered as a standard SOAP Web Services. This is similar to our approach, as well as SciFlo\222s services 12  C ONCLUSIONS  To achieve the science research goal of investigating longterm and global-scale trends in climate, water and energy cycle, and weather variability, we enhanced and improved on existing algorithms to work with distributed and heterogeneous data and information systems infrastructure By developing a service-oriented architecture for discovering, accessing, and mani pulating of NEWS merged A-Train data sets, we can strengthen the interconnectedness and reusability of these services across broader range of Earth science investigations The merged NEWS Level 2 data is a formal model containing the voluminous data from the AIRS, AMSR-E MLS, MODIS, and CloudSat instruments. Previously scientists wanting to perform long-term and global-scale studies encompassing simultaneous measured quantities would quickly face a data acce ss hurdle of first finding the data, then manually downloading them, and finally merging the data into a cohesive model\227before starting their analysis. Additionally the voluminous nature of the data particularly because of the MODIS data\each scientist potentially downloading the same data resulting in redundancy of reprocessing on the client sides. Our paradigm pushes more of the commonly repeated processing onto the server side. Moreover, this avoids repeated downloading of the same data among the science users. We can deliver customi zed averaged, subsetted, and summarized data of the merged A-Train observations to the scientists for them to immediately begin their analysis work We recognized that scientists also often want to perform 223exploratory computing\224 where they can freely explore the aspects of the data and run serendipitous exploration in their own familiar environment. We developed client-side distributed APIs in popular analysis environments such as Matlab, IDL, and Python. Our APIs hide the complexity of Web Services and allow the service capabilities to be embedded in the scientists own computing environments By purposely avoiding the \223web portal\224 paradigm and providing the suite of platform specific APIs in each of these language platforms, we enable the scientists to remain within their own familiar environments to select, process and download the data seamlessly into their environment for their own further analysis. Alternative methods involving web portals force the scientists to leave the environment and manually interact with the web portal to search and download the data We can examine not only long-term changes in amplitude of a single variable but also those among multiple variables Our L3Q clustering method was specifically designed to preserve information about the covariability of multiple observations, such as those from the A-Train.  Weather and climate variability is characterized by changes among atmospheric observables, but those changes have been limited by a lack of observations and analytical techniques We are not aware of any multi-parameter analyses to date The full potential of the A-Train climate record will not be realized until the multi-parameter climatology is understood. The work presented is one method of approaching this difficult problem Our service tool addresses several objectives of the NASA Earth science data community including 1\mprove interoperability to facilitate the transparent access and manipulation of heterogeneous and distributed data by science users, 2\ransition and deploy existing Earth science research analysis tools and software using a 223Service Oriented Architecture\224 \(SOA\ to enhance their reuse potential for other science domains and improve overall awareness and access of these tools by a broad community, 3\ increase users\222 ability to customize their discovery, access, deliv ery, manipulation, and preferred format of data and information 12  F UTURE W ORK  On-demand Level 3T Summaries from Level 3Q We plan to develop services for creating custom summaries of the L3Q data into more refined Level 3T summaries L3T\create their own custom Level 3 products on demand from L3Q. The custom Level 3 products are the transformation of L3Q data based on user-specific objectives such as regression and correlation analyses. The cust om production will generate not only the transformed data but also the statistical estimation of the accuracy of the summarized data based on the distribution of L3Q and the quality of L3Q Delegating the Temporal-Spatial Data Querying Currently, our processing layer utilizes existing and legacy processing code that was developed in IDL, Matlab, and C++. Though the original intent was to be able to adapt existing code and wrap as a service, this meant maintaining its original form of accessing the source data for processing Small modifications were made to enable these codes to quickly access the data based on file path and file naming schemes. However, we want to decouple the file accessibility and processing roles 


  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs.
