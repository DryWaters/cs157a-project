A Method of Security Improvement  for Privacy Preserving Association Rule Mining over Vertically Partitioned Data Yiqun Huang, Zhengding Lu, Heping Hu School of computer science and technology Huazhong University of science and technology Wuhan, Hubei, P.R. China E-mail: yiqunhuang@hotmail.com Abstract There have been growing interests in privacy preserving data mining. Secure multiparty computation \(SMC\ is often used to give a solution When data is vertically partitioned scalar product is a 
feasible tool to securely discover frequent itemsets of association rule mining. However, there may be disparity among the securities of different parties. To obtain equal privacy, the security of some parties may be lowered. This paper discusses the disharmony between the securities of two parties. The scalar product of two parties from the point of view of matrix computation is described. We present one algorithm 
for completely two-party computation of scalar product. Then we give a method of security improvement for both parties 1. Introduction Data mining is a technology to find meaningful models from large data set\(s\. When data is distributed in different sites, centralized warehouse is needed to collect and mine all the data. However, privacy concerning may limit this attempt Privacy preserving data mining has emerged as a 
direction to solve the problem. Two methods have been used to give solutions. One is to disguise all the data before centralization and then mines the modified data 1    Reconstruction is used to gain the same result based on the real values. Another is based on secure multiparty computation \(SMC 5][6 SMC is a kind of distributed computation. It uses new algorithms 
with distributed computation in a secure manner. In these two secure approaches, revised algorithms are adopted to operate on secured data to achieve the same data model generated by the original non-secure approach However, as to privacy preserving distributed data mining with SMC, we find the disparity problems 1\ SMC is a kind of computation conducted by cooperation. The security of different parties may be unequal 
2\. Communication/computation cost is needed to obtain security and the final data mining result Usually, the more security we require, the more the cost of communication and computation is needed Thus, ways should be found to balance the security among different parties. Besides, we need to weigh the security obtained and the cost paid for different algorithms When data is vertically partitioned scalar product of vectors from different sites is a useful technique to discover frequent itemsets of association rule mining 
Up till now, most work has been centered on secure scalar product between two parties. However, to obtain equal privacy for both parties, only n/2 security has been gained for most of the algorithms In Section 2, we first describe scalar product and than present one algorithm for completely two-party computation of scalar product. In Section 3 we introduce our method with an untrusted third party to perform some extra computation 2. Using scalar product to find the frequent itemsets between two parties

association rule mining. The problem is defined as follows [6  There exist a global database which is vertically divided into two parties A and B. Assume A has n transactions and l attributes 1 a  l a B contains n transactions and m attributes 1 b m b Thus, the global database has n rows and l  m columns 1 a l a 1 b m b  Let vector X i.e 1 x  n x nd Y i.e 1 y  n y denote 1 one column of party A and party B respectively Then 1 i x or 1 i y represents the presence of an attribute. And 0 i x  0 i y represents the absence of an attribute 2 the combination of columns for party A and party B respectively. Then j p j i a x 1 l p  1 and j q j i b y 1  m q  1 elegates the corresponding internal itemsets of party A and B Accordingly, whether or not the \(p+q\itemset {x, y between A and B is frequent is to decide the following result of scalar product of X and Y  sup min_ 1 n i i i y x Y X min_sup is the required minimum support of an association rule 2.2 Efficient protocols by Clifton and Vaidya Two-party secure computation of the scalar product can be summarized in formula \(1 n i i i y x Y X 1 B n i i A j n j j i i y R c x 11   A B r n j i n i j i n j j R y c R 1 int 1 1  1 B i r i A r n j j r n i R R 11 1  1 In the above protocol, party A generates its private random vector R i.e 1 R  n R B generates its private random vector R i.e 1 R  r R  Notation A and B represent that the corresponding computation is performed by party A and B respectively. Matrix C is known to both parties. Vector X of party A is encrypted to a new vector X each value is j n j j i i i R c x X 1  Similarly, vector Y of party B is hidden to form another new vector Y  each value is r n j j n i i j i R y c Y 1 int 1 1   Besides, n randoms of R is compressed to r randoms of r n R in which r n j j r n i i r n R R 1 1  A simplified computation of formula \(1\is as follows [7   n i i i y x Y X 1  B n i i A j r j j i i y R c x 11  A B i n i j i r j j y c R 1  1 2 As formula \(2\ shows, only party A needs to generate a new random vector R i.e 1 R  r R  2.3 Secure analysis based on selection of r The security of the above two protocols is based on the inability of either side to solve k equations in more than k unknowns [6   T h e s e l e c t i o n of pa ra m e t e r r a nd matrix C is critical and sensitive to the privacy of both parties Proceedings of the 9th International Database Engineering & Application Symposium \(IDEASê05 1098-8068/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE 


Formula \(1\that n values of X are hidden by 2n unknowns. However, they are revealed by \(n+r equations to party B.

However, they are exposed by n equations to party A.

As to r, 2n>n+r>n is required for protocol \(1\nd n+r>n>r for protocol \(2\wever, there is disparity between the privacy of vector X and Y Reasons are given below 1\r protocol \(1\o hide X from B more securely, 2n should be much greater than \(n+r\\(viz 2n>>\(n+r\ich lead to r<<n. Thus, r should be as small as possible. However, to blind Y from A, \(n+r should be much greater than n \(viz. \(n+r\>>n\, which cause r to be as big as possible. To obtain equal privacy of vector X and Y r should be n/2. If  2 n r protocol \(1\ protect the security for party A at the expense of party B, v.v. From another aspect the key notion of security for party A is to group the generated randoms \(viz R into r sets and transmitted the sum of each group to party B. The smaller party A is grouped, the more privacy party A gained. However it makes the same number of Y share the same generated randoms \(viz R he smaller party B shares the same random, the more security party B gets 2\For protocol \(2\ation of the selecting r is the same. As relationship n+r>n>r shows, when r=n/2 party A and B have equal privacy The problem is that the number of equations revealed for party A is equal to the number of unknowns for party B. Besides, if n/2 values are revealed, all the data are revealed. It is impossible to improve the security beyond n/2 for both parties from the above two protocols. To change this situation, we introduce an untrusted third party 3. Our method of security improvement As we know, vector is a special kind of matrix Scalar product can be gained by matrix computation Both cardinality n vectors X and Y can be expressed by 1 n n rows and 1 column\ matrixes 1 n X and 1 n Y Thus, we can describe protocol \(2\lows A B n T r n T n r B n A T n r r n n n T n Y C R Y R C X Y X Y X 1 1 1 1 1 8 Proceedings of the 9th International Database Engineering & Application Symposium \(IDEASê05 1098-8068/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE 


In the above formula, T represents transpose of a matrix. To improve the security of both two parties, we employ an untrusted third party to perform some computation. The trust place in the party is that it 1\. not collude with any of the participating parties to violate information privacy, and 2\. correctly executes the protocol Then, formula \(8\ can be modified as follows  A B n T r n T r B t A t n T r r n n U B t t n n A T r r n n n T n Y C R R D R C X R D Y R C X Y X Y X 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 9 In the above protocol, party A generates its private random matrix 1 r R Party B generates its own random matrix 1 t R Matrix r n C and t n D are known to both parties to form linear indep endent equations. Notation A and B represent that the corresponding computation is gained by party A and B respectively The untrusted third party U does the following computation  B t t n n A T r r n n R D Y R C X 1 1 1 1  As matrix 1 n X and 1 n Y have been encrypted to two new matrix 1 n X and 1 n Y in which 1 1 1 r r n n n R C X X and 1 1 1 t t n n n R D Y Y n+r>n, n+t>t party U can not obtain the original values of party A and B A has n+r unknowns and t equations revealed to B B has n unknowns and r equations revealed to A Thus, the security of party A requires n+r>t. The security of party B requires n>r. the privacy between party A and B is not at odds. If n+r>t and n>r/2, the security can exceed n/2 for both parties It is easy to find that the improvement of security of both A and B is at the cost of more computation than that of formula \(8\er, as all the computation is totally algebraic, the cost of computation and communication is still acceptable As the minimum support viz. min_sup\known to all parties, the above protocol is turned into judging the following relationship  U B t t n n A T r r n n R D Y R C X 1 1 1 1 sup min_ B t A t n T r r n n R D R C X 1 1 1  A B n T r n T r Y C R 1 1 10 The step of the algorithm is given below 1\ A generates its private matrix 1 r R B generates its private matrix 1 t R  2\.

of two or more regions may overlap. Let o\(t location of object o at time t and assume that o\(t be measured accurately. Instead, we know the set of objects that fall in each region every timestamp, which is indeed the case in many practical applications. For example, although the exact location of every mobile user is not usually known, it is possible to decide the cell that services the user Given an aggregate query q with window qr and time interval qt, we define the set M\(q M\(q t rj intersects qr Note that M\(q i.e the finest aggregation granularity oi ? M\(q query, even though the object itself does not lie in qr during qt. Now we are ready to define the query types considered in this paper Problem 3.1: A distinct \(spatio-temporal DC, for short with window qr and time interval qt returns the number of matching objects, or more formally DC\(q q Assuming that each object oi carries a measure wi invariant with time DS retrieves the sum of the measures of all matching objects DS\(q q The exact computation of DC\(q at least linear to the number of distinct objects. This lower bound also applies to DS\(q case of DS with measure wi=1.Thus, if n is the number of distinct objects and T is the total number of timestamps in history, any solution that solves DC/DS queries precisely needs ?\(n  T both n and T may be very large. To overcome this problem, we develop a structure that answers DC/DS queries approximately, consuming ?\(m  R  T  log n where R is the number of regions, and m is an adjustable constant that, as explained shortly, determines the tradeoff between overhead and approximation accuracy Using the FM algorithm discussed in Section 2, for each region ri \(1?i?m si\(t ids of presents the system for distinct aggregation. At each timestamp, every object reports its id \(or measure, for DS queries has a sketch generator that creates the corresponding sketches based on the object information, and transmits them to the database. To obtain sketches for DC queries the generator simply performs the PCSA algorithm described in Section 2.1.

In other words, let DS be the set of objects that satisfy the condition stated in Lemma 3.2; then, the sketch of DS is exactly the same as the ORci=1sxi\(ti Lemma 3.2 indicates a simple algorithm for approximate DC processing. Consider, for example, a DC query with window qr intersecting r1, r2, r4 and qt=[1,4]. The goal is to compute the OR of the sketches in the shaded cells. In this case, the result is 11100, and since the left-most 0 is at position 4, the \(approximate 1.29  24=10.32. This algorithm, however, is  conceptual   meaning that it does not consider the actual access paths for retrieving the necessary sketches. Efficient sketch retrieval cannot be achieved using conventional data warehouses because there is no natural ordering on the region axis; therefore, regions intersecting qr may not be consecutive. Furthermore, there is no pre-defined hierarchy on regions, rendering traditional group-by techniques inapplicable. Motivated by this, in the next section we introduce the sketch index to accelerate the sketch retrieval 3.2 Sketch index structure The sketch index is similar to the aRB-tree in terms of structure, but differs in the query algorithms. Figure 3.3 shows an example for the data in Figure 3.2. An R-tree indexes the regions r1, r2  r4. Each R-tree entry is associated with a B-tree that records the historical sketches of the corresponding region \(or regions in its sub-tree 4 leaf entries \(in the format &lt;time, sketch&gt 4 sketch changes in history \(i.e., no change at time 3 sketch 11100 of the first root entry in this B-tree equals the OR of all the sketches \(i.e., 10000, 01100 subtree. The same rule applies to all intermediate B-tree entries 


entries Consider the first leaf entry &lt;1,10100&gt; in the B-tree of R1 Its sketch 10100 equals the OR for sketches of r1 and r2 i.e., 10000, 10100, respectively each intermediate R-tree entry Ri, its sketch at any time t is the OR of sketches of all the regions in the subtree \(of Ri incremental maintenance algorithms follow those of the aRB-tree due to the similarity of the structures R-tree for the R 1 R2 r1 r2 r 3 r4 spatial dimensions 4B-tree for r 10000110002100001 1010043 3110001 10100 1B-tree for r 11100011002100001 1010054 4111001 11100 1B-tree for R 11100111002101001 1010154 4111001 11101 2B-tree for r 11000100003101001 1000154 4101001 11001 N 4 N 2 N 1 N 3 3B-tree for r 11111100002010001 5 5110001 11111 2B-tree for R 10100100003110001 4 5110001 11111 111115 Figure 3.3: A sketch index example 3.3 Query processing using the sketch index A straightforward algorithm for answering DC queries using the sketch index is to perform the search in a way similar to that in the aRB-tree. To illustrate this, we assume, for simplicity, the same extents of regions \(r1 r2  r4 R1, R2 in Figure 2.2a. Consider again the query q with window qr \(shown in Figure 2.2a  search algorithm initiates a result sketch RS with all bits set to 0, and gradually updates it. Specifically, the search starts from the root of the R-tree. Since R1 is contained in qr, we fetch the root N1 of its B-tree, where the first entry lt;1,11100&gt; indicates that the OR of all sketches in its subtree during [1,3] is 11100, which becomes the new value of RS. The child node N2 of the second root entry must be searched. Inside this node, entry &lt;4,11100&gt; qualifies qt and thus its sketch is OR-ed with RS \(which, however incurs no change to RS the R-tree and, since R2 partially intersects qr, accesses its child node, in which the only entry intersecting qr is r4 Hence, it visits N3 and N4 producing the final sketch RS=11100. In Figure 3.3, the visited B-tree nodes are shaded The above algorithm applies spatial and temporal conditions \(using qr and qt respectively ignores the pruning power of the sketches themselves Notice that in the previous example RS is already set to 11100 \(i.e., the final result search process \(i.e., after accessing the root of the B-tree 


search process \(i.e., after accessing the root of the B-tree of R1 not affect the final result at all. This motivates the following pruning heuristic Heuristic 3.1: Let RS be the current result sketch, and e an intermediate B-tree entry whose associated sketch is se Then, the sub-tree of e can be pruned if \(se OR RS  Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE  04 1063-6382/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE According to this rule, the processing of the above query can avoid visiting node N4 because the sketch \(10100 its parent entry &lt;3,10100&gt; satisfies 10100 OR RS = RS The implication is that, in order to maximize the effectiveness of Heuristic 3.1, we should first try to maximize the 1's in RS, before descending intermediate B-tree  postpone  visiting nodes that may be pruned later as more bits of RS are set The next question is: which node accesses are avoidable and which ones are necessary To answer this question, let SRE be the set of R-tree entries whose B-trees must be accessed. Equivalently, each entry e in SRE satisfies the following conditions: \(i covered by query rectangle qr \(or its MBR intersects qr if e is a leaf ii i In the example of Figure 3.3, SRE={R1,r4}. Evidently accesses to the roots of their respective B-trees are unavoidable1. Hence we visit all of them \(in Figure 3.3 nodes N1 and N3 of these entries allow us to set \(possibly many without any further node access. The first entry of N1 has lifespan [1,3] \(3 is derived from the timestamp of the next entry 4 we can immediately update RS to its sketch 11100 Similarly, the lifespan [1,2] of the first entry in N3 is also contained in qt; hence its sketch 11000 is also taken into account, but does not change RS Now let us consider the remaining entries in N1 and N3 namely, &lt;4,11101&gt; and &lt;3,10100&gt;. Although, their lifespans are not contained in qt=[1,4], Heuristic 3.1 eliminates &lt;3,10100&gt;. Nevertheless, &lt;4,11101&gt; is not pruned by the heuristic because 11101 OR RS = 11101 RS. However, recall that our objective is not to retrieve the complete final RS. Instead, we are interested in the position of the left-most bit that is still 0. What is the possible left-most position \(of the final RS Given the current RS=11100 and entry &lt;4,11101&gt;, the answer is 4 \(i.e., the left-most 0 must be at the 4-th bit since the first 3 bits of both RS and the entry  s sketch are all 1. Therefore, the access to the child node of this entry can also be avoided, because \(even if we actually visit it the only possible change to RS is to set the 5-th bit to 1 which does not affect our estimation. This observation leads to another heuristic Heuristic 3.2: Let SU be the OR of the sketches of the entries whose sub-trees cannot be pruned so far. If p is the position of the left-most 0 in \(RS OR SU tree of an intermediate \(B-tree sketch se satisfies the following condition    1 1 AND 1...10...0  OR  AND 1...10...0e p p RS RS s       1 


1 Unlike the aRB-tree, we do not store sketches in the R-tree entries because this would decrease the node fanout Heuristic 3.2 subsumes 3.1 by providing a more general condition. Specifically, instead of requiring all bits of RS and \(RS OR se p?1 bits \(of the these sketches where p is decided by RS and SU together indicates a good access order for the child nodes of entries not pruned by Heuristic 3.2 Heuristic 3.3: Given a set of qualifying entries, we visit their child nodes in descending order of the number of 1  s in their sketches We use a heap to manage the entries which cannot be pruned yet, using the numbers of 1  s in their sketches as the sorting keys. As an example, consider another query whose \(i r1, r2, r3, r4 and contains the MBR of R1 but not R2, and \(ii qt=[1,4]. In this case, the algorithm first visits the roots of the B-trees of R1, r3, r4, after which RS=11100, and the heap contains two entries &lt;1,11111&gt; \(from the root of r3  s B-tree the second entry in the B-tree of R1 visit the child node of &lt;1,11111&gt; next since it has more 1  s.

For instance, the order may be decided according to the number of additional bits in RS that may be set \(to 1 and two sketches 11100 and 00110; then according to this order, the second sketch will be processed first \(although it has fewer 1  s while the first sketch can set only one bit adjusting the sorting keys of the entries in the heap as the algorithm proceeds \(and RS changes

The storage of the sketch index at each timestamp is linear to \(i ii log2n of each sketch, and \(iii used. As a result, the total space complexity \(for all T timestamps in the history m  R  T  logn 3.4 Supporting distinct sum queries The proposed method for DC \(distinct count can be applied to DS \(distinct sum the sketches of the leaves. The resulting sketches are then indexed and queried in exactly the same way as described in the previous section. Hence, it suffices to illustrate the specialized algorithm for creating the sum sketches Specifically, the problem is stated as follows: given a dataset with \(possibly duplicate object o, measure w distinct objects. That is, if an object appears with the same measure several times, its measure is added only once We solve this problem by reducing it to DC processing Given an input record \(o, w generation algorithm by inserting w different elements o,?1,w o,?2,w  o,?w,w to distinguish these elements. Consequently, the estimated  count  using FM is actually the sum of the w  s of distinct records \(o, w comparing both o and w problem2. The disadvantage of this approach is that, if w is large, inserting w different elements will be expensive Here we briefly describe an alternative algorithm for generating sum-sketches that remedies this problem \(more 2 An alternative approach is to insert elements of the form o,?i  count  is the sum of the maximum w  s for each distinct o details and proofs may be found in [CLKB04 idea is to leverage the observation of [FM85] that the first few \(say x almost estimator is only concerned with the first 0 in the final sketch, we only need to consider the part \(of the sketch starting at the \(x+1 ignore the insertion of those elements \(let their number be y function \(used by FM probability of setting the i-th bit equals 2?i, each element has probability ?xi=1\(2?i any of Hence, y follows the Binomial distribution3 Bin\(w, ?xi=1 2?i in order to decide how many bits after the x-th one is set and obtain the resulting sketch. Let the left-most 0 of this sketch be at position k'; then the corresponding position k in the sketch of inserting all w elements equals x+k There remains only one question: what is a good value for x? The analysis of [FM85] observes that inserting w distinct items sets the first x = log2 w?2 log2 log2 w bits of the resulting sketch to 1 with high probability. This value is adopted in our implementation. Finally, we note that this method can also be combined with PCSA to improve accuracy, as shown in Figure 3.5 algorithm  sum_PCSA \(DS, h, m, r dataset DS={\(o1,w1 o2,w2  h is a random function such that, Prob[h\(o,w the number of bits in each sketch

Section 4.1 uses sketches to reduce the size of general spatiotemporal databases and enhance the performance of 3 For Binomial distribution x~Bin\(n,p Prob[x=m] is \(nm 1?p Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE  04 1063-6382/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE aggregate processing. Section 4.2 applies sketches to mine spatio-temporal association rules 4.1 Approximating general moving data The discussion in Section 3 assumes a set of regions that constitute the finest aggregation granularity, which may not be the case for the conventional spatio-temporal databases. In this scenario, each object o reports its location \(x,y maintains a tuples in the form &lt;o,x,y,t&gt;. Evidently, the size of the database table grows continuously, so that eventually it becomes prohibitively large \(especially if the number of monitored objects is high space complexity O\(n  T where n is the number of objects, and T is the number of timestamps in the history this deteriorates query performance. In the sequel, we show that, if the goal is to support aggregate queries, we can reduce the size and query overhead significantly, at the trade-off of some small error \(around 15% as shown in our experiments We manually impose a res  res regular grid over the data space \(i.e., each cell of the grid has length 1/res of the total axis extent resolution. Then, the sketch index is directly applicable by treating the grid cells as the finest aggregate granularity. It is worth mentioning that if the number of cells is relatively small \(i.e., low resolution approximation tends to over-estimate the actual result because an object, which does not fall in the query rectangle qr, but in a cell intersecting qr, will also be counted. This problem can be alleviated by setting res to a sufficiently large value \(e.g., 50 in our implementation is easy to verify that the space complexity is O\(\(res  T  logn T  logn further improvement, observe that we can actually remove the R-tree from the sketch index, because the cells indexed by the R-tree are regular. Specifically, it suffices to introduce a hierarchical decomposition as shown in Figure 4.1, where the grid at level i has resolution 2i, and the maximum level equals log2res Level 0 Level 1 Level L B-tree 


B-tree B-tree B-tree B-tree B-tree Figure 4.1: Grid-based approximation Note that, this hierarchy implicitly defines the parentchild relation among cells of different levels \(e.g., the shaded cell at level 0 is the ancestor of all the shaded cells in the lower levels associated with a B-tree managing the historical sketches about objects in its extent \(cells in intermediate levels resemble intermediate entries in the R-tree of a sketch index of cells \(in a particular grid i ii index, descending the hierarchy is only necessary for case i ii can be proven that, given the finest resolution res, the algorithm accesses O\(res  hB for any query hB is the maximum height of the B-tree 4.2 Mining spatio-temporal association rules Consider a user in region ri at time t. What is the probability p that this user will appear in region rj by time t+T? We denote such a spatio-temporal association rule with the syntax \(ri,T,p important in practice. For example, in mobile computing they can identify trends in user movements and lead to better allocation of antenna bandwidth to cater for potential network congestions in the near future Additional constraints, such that ri and rj must be within certain distance, may also be specified By maintaining the sketches of all regions at each timestamp as in Figure 3.2, we can answer the following question easily: given specific ri, rj, and a timestamp t how many users that are in ri at t, appear in rj at any of the following T timestamps \(i.e., t+1  t+T t sketch of ri at time t, and sj\(t t+T rj at the subsequent T timestamps. We first estimate the number n1 of objects at ri at time t \(using si\(t number n2 of objects at rj during time interval [t+1, t+T using ORt+Ti=t+1\(sj\(t+i number n3 of objects that appeared either in ri \(at time T or in rj during [t+1, t+T] \(using ORt+Ti=t+1\(sj\(t+i t Then, the number of objects that appear in ri at time t and then appear in rj during [t+1, t+T] equals n1+n2?n3. This idea naturally leads to a simple brute-force algorithm for discovering the association rules, which as shown in Figure 4.2, checks all possible instances of \(ri, rj, t algorithm associate_rule_mining \(T, p, c T is the horizon; p is the appearance probability; c is the confidence factor 1. for each region ri 2.  for each region rj 3.   sample=0; witness=0 4.   for each timestamp t in history 5.    sample 6.    s' = sj\(t+1 t+2 t+T 7.     n1=FM estimate from si\(t n3=estimate from si\(t 8.    if \(n1+n2?n3 9.   if \(witness/sample&gt;c ri,T,p end associate_rule_mining Figure 4.2: Algorithm for mining association rules Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE  04 1063-6382/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE 5.

sketch-index in answering aggregate queries. Then Section 5.2 studies the effect of approximating spatiotemporal data, while Section 5.3 presents preliminary results for mining association rules 5.1 Performance of sketch-indexes Due to the lack of real spatio-temporal datasets we generate synthetic data in a way similar to [SJLL00 TPS03] aiming at simulation of air traffic. We first adopt a real spatial dataset [Tiger] that contains 10k 2D points representing locations in the Long Beach county \(the data space is normalized to unit length on each dimension These points serve as the  airbases  At the initial timestamp 0, we generate 100k air planes, such that each plane \(i uniformly generated in [200,300], \(ii, iii destination that are two random different airbases, and iv  the velocity direction is determined by the orientation of the line segment connecting its source and destination airbases move continually according to their velocities. Once a plane reaches its destination, it flies towards another randomly selected also uniform in [0.02, 0.04 reports to its nearest airbase, or specifically, the database consists of tuples in the form &lt;time t, airbase b, plane p passenger # a&gt;, specifying that plane p with a passengers is closest to base b at time t A spatio-temporal count/sum query has two parameters the length qrlen of its query \(square number qtlen of timestamps covered by its interval. The actual extent of the window \(interval uniformly in the data space \(history, i.e., timestamps 0,100 air planes that report to airbases in qr during qt, while a sum query returns the sum of these planes  passengers. A workload consists of 100 queries with the same parameters qrlen and qtlen The disk page size is set to 1k in all cases \(the relatively small page size simulates situations where the database is much more voluminous specialized method for distinct spatio-temporal aggregation, we compare the sketch-index to the following relational approach that can be implemented in a DBMS. Specifically, we index the 4-tuple table lt;t,b,p,a&gt; using a B-tree on the time t column. Given a count query \(with window qr and interval qt SELECT distinct p FROM &lt;t,b,p,a&gt WHERE t?qt &amp; b contained in qr The performance of each method is measured as the average number of page accesses \(per query processing a workload. For the sketch-index, we also report the average \(relative Specifically, let acti and esti be the actual and estimated results of the i-th query in the workload; then the error equals \(1/100 set the number of bits in each sketch to 24, and vary the number of sketches The first experiment evaluates the space consumption Figure 5.1 shows the sketch index size as a function of the number of sketches used \(count- and sum-indexes have the same results more sketches are included, but is usually considerably smaller than the database size \(e.g., for 16 signatures, the size is only 40% the database size 0 20 40 60 80

Figure 5.2a illustrates the costs of both algorithms for countworkloads with qtlen=10 and various qrlen \(the index used in this case has 16 sketches also illustrate the performance of the relational method which, however, is clearly incomparable \(for qrlen?0.1, it is worse by an order of magnitude we omit this technique Sketch-pruning always outperforms na  ve \(e.g., eventually two times faster for qrlen=0.25 increases with qrlen, since queries returning larger results tend to set bits in the result sketch more quickly, thus enhancing the power of Heuristics 3.1 and 3.2. In Figure 5.2b, we compare the two methods by fixing qrlen to 0.15 and varying qtlen. Similar to the findings of [PTKZ02]4 both algorithms demonstrate  step-wise  growths in their costs, while sketch-pruning is again significantly faster The experiments with sum-workloads lead to the same observations, and therefore we evaluate sketch-indexes using sketch-pruning in the rest of the experiments 4 As explained in [PTKZ02], query processing accesses at most two paths from the root to the leaf level of each B-tree regardless the length of the query interval Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE  04 1063-6382/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE sketch-pruning naive relational 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 number of disk accesses query rectangle length 300 0 100 200 400 500 600 1 5 10 15 20 number of disk accesses query interval length a qtlen=10 b qrlen=0.15 Figure 5.2: Superiority of sketch-pruning \(count As discussed in Section 2, a large number of sketches reduces the variance in the resulting estimate.

Conclusions While efficient aggregation is the objective of most spatio-temporal applications in practice, the existing solutions either incur prohibitive space consumption and query time, or are not able to return useful aggregate results due to the distinct counting problem. In this paper we propose the sketch index that integrates traditional approximate counting techniques with spatio-temporal indexes. Sketch indexes use a highly optimized query algorithm resulting in both smaller database size and faster query time. Our experiments show that while a sketch index consumes only a fraction of the space required for a conventional database, it can process 


required for a conventional database, it can process queries an order of magnitude faster with average relative error less than 15 While we chose to use FM sketches, our methodology can leverage any sketches allowing union operations Comparing the efficiency of different sketches constitutes a direction for future work, as well as further investigation of more sophisticated algorithms for mining association rules. For example, heuristics similar to those used for searching sketch indexes may be applied to improve the brute-force implementation ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Yufei Tao and Dimitris Papadias were supported by grant HKUST 6197/02E from Hong Kong RGC.
