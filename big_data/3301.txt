Hailstone Detection Based on Image Mining   Zhiying Lu 1 Lei Wang 1 Hongmin Ma 1 Qimeng Zhang 1 Huizhen Jia 2  1 Tianjin Key Laboratory of Process Measurement and Control, School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Tianjin University, Tianjin 300072, China 2 Tianjin Meteorological Bureau, Tianjin, 300074, China E-mail luzy@tju.edu.cn    Abstract   Hailstone is one of the main meteorological disasters and it is very difficult to be forecasted effectively. A novel method of automatic recognition hail cloud is proposed base on association rules in this paper. Firstly, the method preprocesses the original reflectivity image. Then the color features and texture features are extracted from the radar echo image Lastly, the association rules, which are used to distinguish hailstorm from rainstorm and super refract are constructed, namely hail echo ensemble forecast model based on image mining is constructed. The results show that hail echo ensemble forecast model based on image mining has higher accuracy compared with the PUP products   1. Introduction  At present, the hailstone forecast is mainly a short-time work which is done by forecasters who have to observe many radar products. Quantities of hail echo indexes are used to analyze, judge and determine hailstorm area. Depending on the artificial pattern, it is possible to have alert failure. Also the result has much relationship to subjective experience  With the widely use of Doppler radar, lots of radar image products are used. In this paper, to improve the accuracy of hailstorm detection, the image mining is integrated into the hailstorm detection for the first time Using the image mining technology 1 the implicit features and rules from the radar images can be mined and the knowledge is formed. The experimental results validate the availability of the method  2. The discovery of hail echo  Image mining is a process that finds a small set of knowledge \(unknown and interesting pattern previously from large amount of the image data 1  Image mining is an essential part in process of knowledge discovery databases. Knowledge discovery in image as a process 2 is depicted in Figure.1          The method that discovery hail echo based on knowledge discovery in image database is proposed in this paper, it consists of an iterative sequence of the following steps Step 1 Image preprocessing——Create image feature database. The original image can not be directly used for mining. So the image feature database for mining knowledge must be created. It includes a. Format conversion——Transform the original reflectivity image to bitmap b  Data cleaning——Filter noise and in consistent data c. Area selection and image feature extraction——Feature relevant to hailstone detection are extracted from the bitmap Step 2 Data mining——An essential process where data mining technology is applied in order to find out image pattern and potential knowledge Step 3 Pattern evaluation and interpretation——The truly interesting patterns representing knowledge are identified by support and confidence Finally, to support related image services, the acquired knowledge is applied such as object recognition, image classification, retrieval, etc   3.

3.1. The color feature radar echo extraction  Color Feature reflects the perception of human visual system to the color of the physical world Because different color represents different reflectivity in radar images, the color features of radar echo can be used to mining the potential and interesting knowledge of hail cloud  3.1.1. Color histogram Color histogram is computed by discretizing the colors within the image and counting the number of pixels of each other. The histogram is a global feature of image. It can eliminate the influence of image rotation, translation and scaling  3.1.2. Color features The  n th order moment of the sectional area is applied to express color Features of hail clouds 3  1 Mean m the first moment    1 i L i i r f r m 000    1 Where r s an envelope of histogram r is a color value of a point on the envelope 2 n order moment Definition of the n th order moment of the hail cloud on the r-color is described as follows 4         1 i n L i i n r f m r r   000   2 If n 2 is selected 002\035 2  r corresponds to the 2nd order moment of the sectional area equal to the measurement of contrast in gray image. It describes the envelope distribution in relation to mean. Furthermore 002\035 2  r  describes the extent of dispersion of the gray in radar image  If n 3 is selected 002\035 3  r orresponds to the 3rd order moment of the sectional area equal to the deviation of histogram. it measures the degree of asymmetry in relation to mean. Furthermore it describes the distribution of gray-scale in the image  If n 4, the 002\035 4  r is kurtosis. It characterizes the relative peakedness or flatness of the distribution compared to the normal distribution. It shows whether histogram distribution is gathered in the vicinity of average or close to the two ends. Further it describes the gray-scale contrast in the image Meteorology research and experience of forecaster show that the location of radar echo centre always counterparts the extreme height of hail water content This explains that the distribution of hail water content and development trend can be reflected effectively by radar echo strength 5 So, another color feature that is the proportion of 45 dBz higher color frequency is extracted in the total frequency. The feature is defined as high echo proportion. It is described as follow 000 000    L i i L h i i p r r h 1  3 The results of the experiment indicate that echo region detection based on above features is valid in radar images 3.2. The extraction of radar echo texture features  The texture describes the relative distribution of every gray-scale image pixel, and it also reflects the changes of gray-scale or 2D colors. Therefore, the texture of image can be measured by texture features At present, satellite cloud textures were successful analyzed to realize the identification of various clouds such as cumulonimbus, stratus, and cirrus\ and strong convective weathers like typhoon automatically 6 In this section, the method of gray level co-occurrence matrix \(GLCM\ in statistical are introduced 7 to analyze radar image from statistical texture features  GLCM texture based on the second-order gray level probability distribution of a texture image can be calculated by considering the relation between two pixels at a time. It reflects the integrated information of image such as direction, local area and changes in the rate 8 For a given displacement vector 000  000 x  000 y   the probability of a reference pixel at location x  y  having a gray level i and the pixel at location x  000 x  y  000 y   h a v i n g a g r ay le v e l j is  r e p r e s e n te d b y  P  i  j  000   Features are extracted from P  i  j  000 as follows 1. Energy ASM Energy is a measure of textural uniformity of an image. It shows the amount of signal in a specific resolution. The definition is as follows  000¦\000  ij j i P ASM  001    2  4 When the image is not texturally uniform, many GLCM elements have a very small value, which implies that entropy is very large. So, the texture of the image is rough. In contrast, if the energy feature will have smaller value, the texture of the image is silky 2. Contrast CON Contrast measures the amount of local variations in an image. It expresses the clarity of image  000¦\000   ij j i P j i CON  001    2 5 In images, the bigger the contrast is, the deeper the ditch of texture, the visual effect of the image will be clearer 3. Correlation COR Correlation is used to measure the relevance of the GLCM elements at row line\ for the similarity y x y j i x j i P j i COR 002 002     001           000  6 And 000¦\000  ij x j i P i  001      000¦\000  ji j i P j  001    y   000¦\000   ij x x j i P i  001      2  002  000¦\000   ji y y j i P i  001      2  002  4. Entropy ENT Entropy is the measurement of information content of the image; it shows the disorder of an image

 001    lg  001    j i P j i P ENT ij 000¦\000   7 If there is no texture in the image, the value of GLCM will tend to zero and the same is entropy. If there are full of the textures in the image, then the value of GLCM will tend to be the same and entropy becomes the highest 9 If the texture distributes less in the image, the GLCM elements differ a lot and entropy is smaller  5. Local Homogeneity LOC Local homogeneity measures smoothness of an image in a local neighborhood. Here, local homogeneity measures the trends present in the singular  000¦\000    ij j i P j i LOC  001    1 1 2 8 6. Gray Mean GM Gray Mean describes the gray average for the texture uniformity   001     000¦\000  ij j i P i GM   9 7. Gradient Advantage Dd Gradient Advantage describes the size of texture   001       001     2 000¦\000 000¦\000  ij ji j i P j i P Dd   10 In this paper, the algorithm of the features extraction based on P  i, j 000   is as follows  Step1 Normalize images of image base. Before computing GLCM the images in the database are normalized. Normalization is done for all the images in the database by setting mean and standard deviation to common values Step2 Calculate P  i, j 000 of echo regions, where displacement vector 000 1 1  1   0  1   a n d 1  1   Step 3 Calculate above features of four direction vector using P  i, j 000  Step 4 Average each texture feature values of four displacement vector  The features of different radar echo in Figure.2 are obtained in Table.1                    As shown in Figure.2 and Table.1, we know information by texture analysis: the deeper the ditch of radar image is, the clear the texture is, the more obvious the gradient is. It indicates that the more prominent radar echo is, and the stronger the reflectivity intensity is. Therefore, when the contrast feature of radar echo is greater, the energy feature is smaller and the entropy is larger, this radar echo is echo of hail            4. Mining association rules  4.1. The concept of mining association rules   Association rule mining 2 10 plays an important role in the field of data mining. It is a process of finding interesting association or correlation relationship among a large set of data items. That is the rules must satisfy support  min_sup  min support   confidence  min_conf  min confidence   Where rule support and confidence are two measures of rules interestingness. They respectively reflect the usefulness and certainty of discovered rules The greater the value of support is, the more frequently the rules appear in the entire data and the more universal it is. The definition of support and the credibility are as follows  support  A 000 B  P  A 003 B  002  confidence  A 000 B  P  A|B  Where A the former of the rules, it is condition attribution B the latter of the rules, it is decision-making attribution  4.2. Image association rules mining  The method of association rules mining based on image 11 is belong to the domain of association rules, but it is different from association rules mining based on transaction database. In this paper, the main object of radar echo mining is search for the association rules of hailstone detection, the key procedures are Step 1 Data Selection. Selected data records from the characteristics of radar images and builds transaction table Step 2 Discretization of numerical attributes. By method based on discrete distance, it splits every feature attribute into equidistance intervals. Then, it maps every <attribute, interval> to a Boolean attribute  C A B A  Hail;   B  Super-refraction;  C  Rainstorm Figure 2   Different radar echo  Tabl e 1 The features of different radar echo  Features Hail Storm Rain Super-refraction Mean 63.713 41.228 26.904 002\035 2  r 24456.1 7163.56 2505.89 002\035 3  r  1.367  10 6  249593 -56023.5 002\035 4  r  7.662  10 7 8.755  10 6 1.266  10 6  h p  57.22 49.071 19.543 ASM 0.0308 0.0327 0.0288 CON  1.5088 1.5753 3.8647 COR 0.0197 0.0138 0.00756 ENT 3.7706 3.7768 4.0859 LOC 0.6731 0.65284 0.56427 GM 8.2533 6.9172 5.19701 Dd 0.10037 0.11074 0.12022

Step 3 Search for frequent itemsets. Each of this itemsets will occur at least as frequently as a pre-determined minimum support count  Step 4 Rules formed. Set all frequent itemsets L 1  L 2 L k as the former rules, and the type of the echo characteristics as latter rules, then rules to be formed  Step 5 Save strong association rules from Step 4 as knowledge base \(rules base  4. 3. Results and analysis  The association rules based on radar images experiment are mined, and the part results are shown in Table.2                 Combining meteorological knowledge, the mining results will be analyzed and compared with radar images in this paper. The knowledge is summarized as follows 1\ The cloud area where has high reflectivity has high possibility of hail  2\ The higher the compactness value is, the more irregular the edges of the radar echo images are. The definition of compactness is as follows Radio  L 2 4 004 A Where L is the length of region A is the area of region  3\ The area of storm cloud is always great and the high reflectivity of storm cloud is less than hp. It indicates that the certain values of reflectivity of storm cloud have uniformity and has not levels of overall 4\he contrast features of super refraction region are higher than hail cloud and storm cloud regions 5. Rule-based hail echo detection  To classify the hail echo region and detect the hail echo, the mining results of association rules based on radar images is used  5.1. The process of automatic hail echo detection  1\ Image preprocessing and image segmentation  2\ The automatic selection of cloud region  a. The region labeling algorithm is applied to the segmented binary image to mark connected region in radar reflecting. And the connected regions that will not occurred strong convective weathers \(such as the area is too small\ in short time are filtered  b. To detect echo region, all connected region are marked with blue rectangular boxes. It is depicted in Figure.3            c. Connected region are Linked by chain list which will be detected and ready for the next step process  d. The specific cloud region is obtained and the binary image is turned into original  3\ Feature extraction of cloud region: The five color and seven texture characteristics from echo region are calculated using method of section 3 4\ Detection of cloud region: The characteristic vectors, such as the color feature and texture feature of cloud region and rules from knowledge base are used to detect cloud region. During the process of the detection, the strategy of rule-priority is applied in order to solve conflicts, that is, the condition of rule R i  is superior to rule R j is   The confidence of R i is higher than R j that is   R i  conf  R j  conf 002    The confidence of two rules is the same, but the support of R i is higher than Rj, that is  R i  conf  R j  conf  R i  sup  R j  sup  002     The confidence and the support of R i and R j are the same, but R i generates earlier than R j    Default rule should be used to classify data objects, when the other rules are not satisfied with above conditions  5\ Show the results: the hail cloud regions of radar images detected are marked with white rectangular boxes. The results are shown in Figure.4            5.2.

In this paper, the test samples are composed of 15 large hail examples in all 699 images, 17 slight hail examples in all 459 images and 12 rainstorm examples in all 594 images, which are offered by weather bureau of a city. The result obtained by Association Rules is shown in Table.3            As shown in Table.3, 1 monomer and 2 monomers were alert failure respectively in hail examples Because hail melted when falling and can not sense on the ground, 3 monomers in 459 images won’t cause disaster The results show that hail echo ensemble forecast model based on association rules has higher accuracy compared with the PUP products. And the hail cloud detection based on association rules satisfies practical applications. It supports forecasters to make more accurate forecasts   6. Conclusion  1\ A novel method of image mining is proposed in the hail detection model. And a system that is concerned on the automatic hail echo detection based on mining rules was built. This system is applied to distinguish hail cloud to rainstorm cloud and super-refraction effectively  2\ The accuracy of the hail cloud detection is obviously higher by classifying the production rules than that by the PUP products  3\ The system can help forecasters to make accurate forecasts Theoretical analysis and experiment results show that the automatic hail echo detection based on mining rules is effective. This method is a whole new route and made great contribution for the automatic hailstone detection. This research of this paper is a challenging and developing work, and is worth in-depth studies in the future  References   u rl  M  C e t  a l   M i n i n g f o r Im a g e Co n t e n t    Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics  Information Systems  Analysis and Synthesis \(SCI-ISAS99  Orlando, FL  Jul.1999  2 J i a w ei H a n  an d M i c h el in e K a m b er   Data Mining  Concepts and Techniques Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, Beijing , 2000   u j i n Z h a n g  Image Engineering Tsinghu University Press, Beijing, 2002    u j i n Z h a n g   Content-based Visual Information Retrieval Science Press, Beijing, 2003   5 Y a n  C a i an d D e s h an g F u  C la s s i f i ca t i o n o f B a s e d  on Satellite Data and Its Program Design Journal of Nanjing Institute of Meteorology Sept.1999, Vol.22 No.3, pp. 416-422   u l o n g H a o  B a oy i C h e ng Y i n F a n  a n d H o n g j un Zhang, “Auto-recognition of Typhoon Based on the Character of Layout of Texture Direction Journal of Image and Graphics Dec. 2002, Vol.7, No.12,pp 1319-1322   a n q i n g  T i a n  P i ng G u o  a n d P i ngqi ng L u   T e x t u r e  Feature Extraction of Multiband Remote Sensing Image Based on Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix Computer Science 2004, Vol.31, No.12, pp. 162-163   8 P i n g Y u e X i a o y u n Li u  Li an g cai G u o an d  Changhong Lv, “Identification Geosynchronous Satellite Infrared Image and Detection Violent Convective Weather System in Flood Season by Textural Analysis Technique Arid Meteorology Jul 2005, Vol.23, No. 2, pp. 50-53     Rafael C.

If in Fig. 4 there is at least one T, then DCAR6 holds DCAR1 through DCAR6 forms a complement lattice shown in Fig. 5 In Fig. 5, the lower rule implies the upper rule That is, if DCARj is reachable from DCARi via an ascending path, and DCARi holds, then DCARj holds Because DCAR1 through DCAR6 satisfies Fig 5, their algorithms can be merged into one algorithm called connective determination algorithm, shown in Fig. 6 Suppose cf 1 80%, cf 2 75%. In Fig. 4, for the column of C1, there are M*cf 1 5*80%=4 elements whose values are T \(namely, S1, S2, S3, S5 Therefore, DCAR2: course\(Cno 004 1  student\(Sno 003 1  study\(Sno, Cno\olds. From Fig. 5, we know that DCAR3 and DCAR6 also hold. In Fig. 4, there are at least N*cf 2 4*75%=3 columns which have value T \(namely, in the column of C1 there is S1, in the column of C2 there is S1, in the column of C3 there is S2, in the column of C4 there is S5 therefore DCAR5: course\(Cno 003 1  student\(Sno 004 1  study\(Sno, Cno  VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS 1\ Double-connective association rule mining is different from single-connective association rule mining. The former mines the association among the primary keys of the two entity tables and the primary key of the binary relationship table. The latter mines the association between frequent item sets 2\. 4 is different from data cubes in data warehouses. The elements in Fig. 4 are T or F. The elements in the data cubes are data 3\The differences between double-connective association rule and database query are that, first, the query information in databases are predeterminate while the information to be mined by double-connective association rule is not predeterminate, it is implied. Secondly, database query needs to write SQL statements, while double-connective association rule mining is automatic. Thirdly, the information obtained by database query is quantitative, while the information obtained by double-connective association rule mining is qualitative such as “for many”, “there are some  REFERENCES 1 Ji a w ei H a n   M i ch eli n e K a m b er   D a t a  M i n i n g C onc ep t s  a nd Techniques, Higher Education Press, Beijing, 2001, Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, 2000 2 A  G  Ha m i lt on  L o gi c for M a th em a t i c ia ns R evi s ed E d i t i o n   Cambridge University Press, 1988, Tsinghua University Press Beijing, 2003 3 X unw e i Z h o u   Br ie f I ntr o du c t io n  to  Mu t u al l y I nve r s is tic Logic”, 1999 European Summer Meeting of the Association for Symbolic Logic, Utrecht, The Netherlands, August 1-6 1999 4 u n w ei Zh ou F i r s t leve l exp l i c i t m u lt ip le i ndu ct i v e composition”, 2005 Spring Meeting of the Association for Symbolic Logic, The Westin St. Francis Hotel, San Francisco CA.

support pruning gene expression classifier with an accurate and compact fuzzy rule base for microarray data analysis Biosystems vol 85 computationally challenging As training set sizes increase it is likely that these difficulties will also increase VI RELATED WORK While operating on a microarray dataset current CAR 1 2 3 4 and other pattern/rule 20 21 mining algorithms perform a pruned and/or compacted exponential search over either the space of gene subsets or the space of sample subsets Hence they are generally quite computationally expensive for datasets containing many training samples or genes as the case may be BSTC is explicitly related to CAR-based classifiers but requires no expensive CAR mining BSTC is also related to decision tree-based classifiers such as random forest 19 and C4.5 family 9 methods It is possible to represent any consistent set of boolean association rules as a decision tree and vice versa However it is generally unclear how the trees generated by current tree-based classifiers are related to high confidence/support CARs which are known to be particularly useful for microarray data 1 2 6 7 11 BSTC is explicitly related to and motivated by CAR-based methods To the best of our knowledge there is no previous work on mining/classifying with BARs of the form we consider here Perhaps the work closest to utilizing 100 BARs is the TOPRULES 22 miner TOP-RULES utilizes a data partitioning technique to compactly report itemlgene subsets which are unique to each class set Ci Hence TOP-RULES discovers all 100 confident CARs in a dataset However the method must utilize an emerging pattern mining algorithm such as MBD-LLBORDER 23 and so generally isn't polynomial time Also related to our BAR-based techniques are recent methods which mine gene expression training data for sets of fuzzy rules 24 25 Once obtained fuzzy rules can be used for classification in a manner analogous to CARs However the resulting fuzzy classifiers don't appear to be as accurate as standard classification methods such as SVM 25 VII CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK To address the computational difficulties involved with preclassification CAR mining see Tables IV and VI we developed a novel method which considers a larger subset of CAR-related boolean association rules BARs These rules can be compactly captured in a Boolean Structure Table BST which can then be used to produce a BST classifier called BSTC Comparison to the current leading CAR classifier RCBT on several benchmark microarray datasets shows that BSTC is competitive with RCBT's accuracy while avoiding the exponential costs incurred by CAR mining see Section VB Hence BSTC extends generalized CAR based methods to larger datasets then previously practical Furthermore unlike other association rule-based classifiers BSTC easily generalizes to multi-class gene expression datasets BSTC's worst case per-query classification time is worse then CAR-based methods after all exponential time CAR mining is completed O SlS CGl versus O Si CGi As future work we plan on investigating techniques to decrease this cost by carefully culling BST exclusion lists ACKNOWLEDGM[ENTS We thank Anthony K.H
