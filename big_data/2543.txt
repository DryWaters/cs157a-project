INTRODUCTION\nThere are few approaches with the potential to improve\nthe reliability and security of Intelligent Transport Systems\nusing the possibilities to merge local resources of vehicle and\ndifferent kind of global cloud oriented services [3]. Senergy\neffect is achieved by the integration of three key technologies\ninto reconfigurable and scalable service infrastructure the\ninformation, computer and communications. Such a process\nis not a trivial task, especially in the case of transportation\nsystems that support interaction with the moving objects.\nBonus from this technological effort is to expand online\nservices to drivers and passengers, increase logistics efficiency\nand security of transport operations, as well as the prevention\nof accidental events. In this context the main challenge con-\ncerning design of new generation of ITS is associated with\ncollaborative decision of fundamental problem arrange real\ntime access to big data from moving car [4]. All aspects of this\nproblem have a common background that closely associated\nwith communication technology tasks, namely:\nConnecting user to local and global data. The volume of\ndata to witch has access the vehicle is a critical parameters\nof the of ITS. This requirement defend hierarchical structure\nof communication system, the local part of which provided to\nthe end–users and improve latency, and the second one belong\nto the global cloud–oriented distributed information services\nhousing information at data center sites far from the edge of\nITS information infrastructure.\nDistributing computing tasks between vehicle and cloud\nbackbone resources. Computing platform extends ITS services\nby sharing multipurpose operation with data between mobile\nreal time vehicles appliances and high performance massive\nscale resources belongs to global information network or\nprivate cloud backbone 5].\nSupport mobility and bilateral vehicle interaction. Mobility\nis a key feature of ITS, that should be taking account due\nto improve performance, security and privacy issues. By con–\ntrolling data at networks edge points, integrates multiprotocol\nvehicles gateway with distributed communication infrastruc-\nture.\nSeamless integration with security services. Data security\nrequired seamless integration of information and communica-\ntion services. This can be reach by using specific decision with\nbase on stealth firewall technology belong to vehicle telematics\nhardware platform and IaaS components of cloud environment.\nTaking into account all aspects that are mentioned above\nwe consider new services for Vehicle Controls Systems VCS automotive protocols that\nsupporting by vehicle embedded computing appliances, as well\nas available via MESH network private cloud resources and\nglobal public information systems. From the system point of\nview new services can be divided into three main categories:\n1 require-\nments; 2 storage systems\naccessible to VCS and belongs to ITS cloud environment.\nDiscussed approach can be utilized not only within ITS but\nalso for various applications including emergency departments,\nregional data centers and IoT applications [2].\nThe paper is organized in four sections. In the second\nsection we introduce basic requirements for new generation\nof ITS system, delineates characteristics, architecture and data\nstructure of proposed services. The third section takes as\nclose look at a key component of MESH network required\nto support mobility services. In the fourth section we propose\nnew decision to enhance access to control services base on\nstealth firewalls.\n2013 13th International Conference on ITS Telecommunications ITST 


infrastructure management vehi-\ncles is the technology of cloud computing. This technology al-\nlows taking into account the distributed character and dynamic\nnature of the transport systems that their necessary to improve\ntheir sustainability and scalability. The synergistic effect of the\nuse of cloud technology has a number of aspects, including:\n• improving dynamics at the physical and links layers of\nMESH segment of using infrastructure;\n• expanding available information and computing services;\n• spreading end–user requests between several access\npoints and applications due to reduce response time and\nincrease semantic significance of the responses.\nThe main technological challenger concerning the way how\nto allocate distinguishing services and provides their proximity\nto end–user. One of the perspective way to solved problems\nmention above is to use cloud–oriented approach with can be\nextend for mobility application due to use delay tolerance and\nsecure infrastructure services \(Fig. 1 information to the\ncloud environment and to other vehicles simultaneously. The\nvehicle control system itself shall have a non–zero probability\nto crash or fail. However, the flow of data from vehicle via\nwireless mediums is susceptible to interference that can disrupt\nconnectivity and interaction of network nodes and service\ncomponents. In this case, the reasonable metric of effective-\nness of the tasks listed above is the probability of delivering the\nmessage in a given time interval from the source to a particular\ndestination within the shared cloud infrastructure. Delivery\nprobability is a controlled parameter which is a function of\nthe cloud resources needed to process requests for services.\nFor example, fault tolerant implementation of supervisory\ntasks, such as route planning or vehicle speed set–point can\nbe achieved with requested level of probability relying on\nthe distributed cloud computing power. Furthermore, service\nagents which interact with vehicle applications and run on a\nremote virtual machine \(VM by analyzing historical driving patterns\nalong the same route over many different conditions.\nThe concept of virtual machine in the cloud architecture\nand MESH network, that we are proposing, provides the\nimplementation of fault–tolerant, powerful and flexible tool\nfor managing the traffic services, roads infrastructure and\nvehicle data. The implementation of such concept which is\nbased on the organization of access from vehicles appliances\nto cloud backbone services is executed through the currently\nexisting wireless and hard–wire connections of the various\ntechnologies.\nSecure communication between vehicle and cloud services\ncan be implemented in three ways: vehicle–to–vehicle \(V2V V2I vehicle–to–\ncloud \(V2C  and third — recon-\nfigurable wireless network. Merge together all this technology\nprovided solid background for bilateral information interaction\nbetween all parts of ITS. That leads to simultaneous use of\ncommunication channels of various technologies for improved\naccessibility to cloud services which requires integration to the\nshared wireless multiprotocol network of data communication.\nClassical algorithms of MESH networks offer the search of\nsingle route to a unique pre–known user. In the case of the\ncloud–oriented service and vehicles appliances interaction it is\nrequired to make a choice of the most perspective point from\nseveral alternatives. It is necessary to find available points with\nthe cloud access and to evaluate perspective of communication\ntransfer and receipt through them.\nFig. 2 presents the chart of interaction of multiprotocol\nMESH network with the cloud–oriented environment.\nFig. 2. Scheme of interaction of MESH network with the cloud–oriented\nenvironment.\nLocal vehicles appliances communicate via MESH network\nsingle vehicles V2V component V2I\nand V2C component implemented in two ways: by the vehicle\n2013 13th International Conference on ITS Telecommunications ITST area can access\nthe cloud through a vehicle transmitter chain. The network\nprovides a bidirectional message transfer — from the vehicle\nto the cloud and inversely.\nThe most important task of such network building is the\nalternative choice of communication protocol usage for in-\ncreasing message transfer adequacy. Estimation of message\ndelivery time to cloud services and the MESH network users\ndepends on vehicle traffic intensity communication network\ndownload traffic, interface availability and its composition in\nvehicles.\nA set of interfaces that allows being a user of LTE and\nMESH networks concurrently or MESH only \(communica-\ntion between vehicles only network\npoints LTE, 802.11s serves\nas a gateway providing communication between the MESH\nnetwork and the cloud environment through LTE.\nDependencies of message transfer adequacy, design and\nactual communication speed relations, mean lag of message\ndelivery during interaction as among vehicles appliances as\ncloud environment. These features depend on the set of used\nroute protocol and data transfer intensity.\nFeatures of the communication network in question\ngiven in fig. 2 are following:\n• short lifetime of MESH the vehicles;\n• necessity of message transfer via MESH to the point that\nhas an access to the cloud–oriented environment;\n• seamless integration with 


security services use cloud–\noriented private environment.\nIII. IMPLEMENTATION MULTIPROTOCOL TECHNOLOGY IN\nFUTURE ITS\nTo fully leverage cloud–based infrastructure in providing\ndifferent vehicle services, especially within mission critical\ntasks we need to ensure multiprotocol support for message\nand data delivery within restricted time interval using different\nkind of telecommunication protocols. These aspects are key\nrequirements for future ITS that should operates with mobile\nobjects and fixed components of infrastructure. The first as-\npect can be resolved by using network access devices with\nreconfigurable multi–frequency radio connections that are at\nthe low level compatible with wireless interfaces \(Fig. 3 others components of ITS we need to have computabil-\nity between access node of cloud infrastructure wireless\ngateway, and telematics appliances of mobile objects.\nTo support processing of information interactions mentioned\nabove requires designing a new generation of multiprotocol\nrouters for DSRC, LTE, MESH WI–FI networks. Such routers\nshould synthesize optimal paths taking into account the nom-\ninal and available bandwidth as well as ongoing delays of\ndelivering data packets or control information. These routers\nshould have a well–defined relationship between: 1 policy\nand the current network topology, and 3 services.\nand the data characteristics type the characteristics of the data\nlink layer protocols.\nUse of large number of parameters needs simulation model\nrealization. The NS–3 simulator v. 3.16 does not give a ready\nsolution for creation of a multiprotocol node that serves as a\ngateway between different wireless technologies. Building of\nsimulation model of mobile communication network required\nrealization of a multiprotocol point model functioned as mes-\nsage routing between MESH communication networks [6].\nRealization of a multiprotocol node is made on the base of\na ”spot–to–spot” virtual point enabled intermediate interaction\nbetween interfaces. To implement a model with the multipro-\ntocol point that provides NS–3 libraries and original code.\nTo implement a model with the multiprotocol point that\nprovides NS–3 libraries and original code. Modules NS–3 used\nin the process of model implementation:\n• 802.11s interface model Implementation enables by de-\nfault to use the HWMP route protocol in proactive and\nreactive modes, in addition to that route protocols for\nwireless MESH networks will be used: OLSR, AODV,\nDSDV.\n• implementation of route protocol models in wireless\nnetworks HWMP, OLSR, AODV, DSDV;\n• FlowMonitor is a module of network traffic statistics\ncollecting and processing;\n• WireShark is an analyzer of computer network traffic;\n• PyViz is a module of model visualization;\n• NS–3–highway–mobility is a model of vehicular traffic.\nParameters of simulation lead to choice settings of route\nprotocol, several network interfaces, speed of communication,\nnumber of transmitting points and type of network traffic are\nset up. Simulation is resulted in a set of XML–files generated.\nValid values of simulation parameters prescribed by such\nlimits allow researching the most dynamic periods of the\nMESH network existence \(short time of the network life,\n2013 13th International Conference on ITS Telecommunications \(ITST intensity of route\nrelocation protocol, communication traffic intensity,\nnumber of network points. Various sets allows to analyze\ndifferent kind of MESH and cloud–oriented states as esti-\nmation of security level of data transfer, actual speed of\ndata transfer supported by the network and average time\nof message exchange of the network point with the cloud–\noriented environment.\nIV. SECURITY SERVICES FOR CLOUD–ORIENTED ITS\nINFRASTRUCTURE\nNow we will discuss the organization of bilateral access\nservices control provided for the mobile and fixed compo-\nnents of the intellectual transport system \(Fig. 4 the services integration by using the expanding to cloud\napplications existing version of the patented \(US 7281129, RF\n2214623 so called addressless or\nstealth modes using security policy semantic as an invariant of\nany interconnection between vehicles and ITS resources [7].\nOperational form of proposed service can be represented as\na set of traffic filters that applies to each virtual connections\nusing for interactions.\nThe development of cloud computing environments requires\nnew approaches to provide information security. These require-\nments stem from the need to consider the dynamic nature of\nthe processes allocation of computing and network resources\nin the configuration of a virtual machines which are the basic\ncomponents of modern service infrastructure. In this section\nwe discuss an approach of the firewalls configuration by which\nproviders of IaaS services are formed control access policies to\nthe cloud resources. For this purpose on each stages of firewall\nconfiguration the semantic model of the active list of filtering\nrules should correspond to semantic model of selected access\npolicy. To fulfill the requirements of information security for\nall possible configurations of cloud environment resources\nsemantics \(model model or be close in sense of chosen\ncriteria. The complexity of configuring the firewall rules in\nthe cloud 


environment derived from the fact that access to the\nservices which allocated as IaaS resources can be performed\nusing different security patterns or models. Operational form\nof these models can be represented as a set of filters that\napply to traffic at the different levels of network interactions.\nSince the parameters of virtual machines that implement the\napplication services are allocated dynamically to properly\nimplement the chosen access policy the active filtering rules\nshould also be changed during operation. In these circum-\nstances, the traditional manual control settings of firewall rules\nin according to the access policy become very difficult. It\nshould be noted that in such dynamic environment as IaaS\nmost stable part of the information relations is specifications of\nselected access policy. These specifications are special type of\nmetadata that reflect the semantics of access strategy. Clearly,\nthis strategy is not changing depending on the dynamic re-\nconfiguration of available resources, so it can be regarded as a\nfunctional invariant of cloud services. Therefore it is especially\nimportant development the methods of automatic configuration\nof filtering rules and adaptation their parameters to the current\nstate of cloud infrastructure which can be viewed as carrier of\nthe mentions above invariant. Since the parameters of cloud\nenvironment are allocated dynamically filtering rules should\nalso be changed as far as possible [8]. In these circumstances,\nthe traditional manual control settings become very difficult\nand unrealizable. But in dynamic cloud environment there\nis some stable part, IaaS for example, that can used as a\ncarrier of the mentions above invariant and generates new\nfirewall configuration settings [9]. The formal model of cloud\nenvironment includes several parameters, namely.\n U,R, P,C > \(1 of privileges:\nrole = {pi}, i = 1 . . . n, role ? P , C — is a set of\nuser sessions which are presented by information virtual\nconnections between subjects and objects in a cloud, P —\nset of privileges in the following form: u ? U — user of a\ncloud system, who is running information service \(e.g. web\napplication ri}, i = 1 . . . n — set of rules which\nidentify network application. The rule consist of following\nparameters: r =< transport, port, protocol, ext >, where\ntransport — transport layer protocol \(e.g TCP or UDP application protocol.\nThe example P form by the following parameters:\n{ user:Ivan,\n transport:"TCP",\nport:"80",\nprotocol:"HTTP",\next:[ { method:"GET" }]}]}.\nThis privilege allows access to web servers which are\nrunning on port number 80 using HTTP protocol and HTTP\nmethod GET to virtual machines which below to user with\nname Ivan. Continue our formalization the state of cloud\nsystem can be presented in a following form:\nState = {vmi}, i = 1 . . . n, State ? VM× U \(2 of IP\naddresses of running virtual machines in a cloud. State is a set\nof addresses of running virtual machines with labels of users\nwho started virtual instance. This approach allows translating\nsecurity policy in RBAC model to filtering rules according to\nthe state of cloud environment. As explain above when the\nstate S changes all firewalls on a mobile and fixed parts of\nITS receives message ”new virtual machine with privileges\nP start” or ”virtual machine with privileges P stop” from\n2013 13th International Conference on ITS Telecommunications \(ITST generates new filtering rules keeping\nsemantic of security policy.\nTo provide a consistent set of rules consider operation\ngen\(as, ao, p and for object \(information ser-\nvice p =< us ruli 3 and\nwhen user requests new service ITS launches new virtual\nmachine and its security subsystem inspects user privileges\nand generate filtering rules which are running in another virtual\nmachine and vice versa. Stealth mode allows implementing the\ninformation protection system in a form of dedicated security\ndomain. This domain can be quickly adapted to the current\nstate of network infrastructure and scaled if necessary to\nachieve seamless integration without reconfiguration of current\nITS routing policy.\nThe proposed IaaS computing platform with integrated\nsecurity is implemented in telematics department of the Saint–\nPetersburg State Polytechnic University and operates for ITS\nand other services. This platform is built on top of OpenStack\nservices with custom proprietary software components. The\nplatform installation is fully automated by Chef scripts and\nit is possible to install all services in few hours on standard\nhardware. Our secure cloud computing test bench is available\nin the internet at following address: http://cloudlet.stu.neva.ru.\nV CONCLUSION\nThe results of this research can be summarized as perspec-\ntive way the expands opportunity for practical implementation\nof future ITS systems within emerging concept of Internet of\nThings \(IoT decisions can be used to reduce traffic\ncongestion and emergency incidents, support multiprotocol\ninteractions and predictable real time performance for different\nkind of end–user applications, that needs to:\n• sharing data between mobile objects and fixed infrastruc-\nture nodes;\n• routing messages in multiprotocol mode\n 


delivering urgent and delay tolerance information;\n• integration security services between ITS applications.\nOur future research will be focused on applying cloud\ncomputing paradigm to develop communication services that\nadequate to the times and a safer requirements for the future\ngeneration of ITS.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis research was supported by a grant from the Ford\nMotor Company.

The third column presents the \nevidence on the selected studies. \nTABLE VII PROPOSED APPROACHES  \nApproach Description Evidence \(S1-S22 nRepoGuard RepoGuard is a framework for \nintegration of development tools with \nsource code repositories RepoGuard is \nwritten in the Python programming \nlanguage, which allows for easy \nintegration of other tools The following \nversion control systems are currently \nsupported:  Subversion, Git, and Perforce.\nS9 nPeer-to-peer \nversion control\nThe decentralized peer-to-peer version \ncontrol system is built on top of  the p2p-\nframework FreePastry, which implements \nthe Pastry overlay routing and \nmaintenance. \nS7 \nConceptual nFramework  \nbased on \ncomponents  \nFramework for the evolution of software \nmodels in a collaborative modeling \nenvironment.

RQ4 – How was the described research evaluated? \nThis question’s purpose was to determine how the \nselected works were evaluated. Among 29 selected studies, \nmost of them \(9 studies nuse examples, other 4 were not evaluated the proposal, and 3 \narticles are experience reports and experimental studies. \nOther 2 articles are systematic mapping. Only one study was \nevaluated combining both industry report and university \nreport, as shown in Figure 5. \n \nFigure 5 Research Evaluated \nV. CONCLUSIONS nThis section presents the final considerations and the \ndiscussions about the results. Furthermore discusses nlimitations of this research and further research. \nA. Discussion about the Results \nDSD is generally recognized  as  being  much more  \nchallenging  than  traditional  co-located  development. \nArticles mentioned in this study ensure that the distributed \nenvironment heightens the challenges faced in traditional nsoftware development. In this context, CM has a critical role. \nThe Version Control is used in all subsequent phases of \nsoftware planning and developing. Development, testing, \ndeployment, and installation are done based on the software \nconfiguration [1]. \nIn the distributed environment, a greater effort is required \nto guarantee that all the people involved have a perception of \nthe evolution of their work, and that the conflicts are \nresolved. Moreover, the people involved need to be sure that \nthey are working on the last version of the project artifacts, \nand that there is no room for inconsistency in the project. It \nis highly important that there is an aiding tool to version \ncontrol that keeps the artifacts consistency and improves the \nwork coordination. \nAn interesting reflection is made on [16], when the \nauthors say that “CM was put into the world exactly to \nhandle certain aspects of distribution on traditional projects”. \nThey say that rarely requirement engineers, designers, \ntesters, and programmers are sitting at the same place at the \nsame time.  \nNevertheless, there are only a few works on the topic that \nevidences what changes exactly in the Version Control for \nDSD projects, what the challenges related to the distributed \nenvironment are, and what are the proposed solutions to \nmitigate these challenges in this scenario.  \nThis research’s main question was How is Version \nControl performed in Distributed Software Development”. It \nwas asked in order to verify if the same tools used in \ntraditional software development are also used in the \ndistributed environment and whether they offer or not the \nneeded support. \nIn this sense, this work’s main contributions consists in a 


nmapping of the challenges and solution proposals to support \nversion control in the distributed development scenario: \n \n#1: Academic tools to support Version Control in \nDSD projects \nThis research evidenced that researchers are concerned \nabout allowing for a better perception of the work that is \nbeing developed by other remote team members, such as \nconstant conflict verification when it comes to Version \nControl in DSD Another spotted concern is present in the \nproject design phase, especially the evolutions of UML \nmodels nSeven academic tools have been identified \(ADAMS, \nPalantír, SYSIPHUS, ADAMS+STEVE, CoDesign and \nSyde, CASI and all of them are based in the client-server \nmodel. Whereas ADAMS, SYSIPHUS, ADAMS+STEVE, \nand CoDesign are mainly focused on collaborative modeling \nsupport, CASI, Palantír e Syde are focused on source code. \n \n#2 Industrial Tools to support Version Control in \nDSD projects   \nSeven version control tools that are popular in \nconventional software development were indicated by two \nselected studies. The authors used the Git, Jazz and \nMercurial tools in academic projects at which students \nworked in a distributed scenario.  \nJust a few studies identified in this research evinced the \nutilization of traditional co-located VCS. However, one ncannot state that these tools are not used at all, but it is fact \nthat their use is not frequently reported in the literature. \n \n#3: Obstacles detected by the searches regarding \nVersion Control in DSD \nThirteen challenges related to Version Constrol in DSD \nprojects have been identified, some of which were mentioned nmore times than other by the selected studies, as dispersed \nsoftware teams do not get information on what other teams \nare doing and the conflict detection delay.  \n97\nThe challenges that were mentioned several times are \nalso the ones that are the targets of the proposed aiding tools. \nPalantír, for instance, aims at providing a wider perception of \nthe work that is being developed in different workspaces. \n \n#4: Few works evaluated in industrial environments \nand experimental studies \nMost of the selected studies’ proposals were tested solely \nin academic environments or merely represent simple use \nexamples. This shows that is need a greater exchange \nbetween the academy and industry so that both can benefit \nfrom it. With this proximity thus, academics can level up the \nmaturity of their researches and propose more appropriate \nsolutions to the needs of software companies. \nB. Limitations \nThe main limitations and threats to the validity of this \nstudy lie in the fact that the mapping process was performed \nby only one researcher. This threat is considered acceptable \nby [14] for doctoral students that make use of this method. \nAccording to the text, it is sufficient that the thesis advisor \nengages in the protocol review and perform parts of the \nreview himself nIn addition, from the 11 studies selected from the \nresearch libraries, the backward snowballing and forward nsnowballing were used only twice. The first application of \nthe snowballing method resulted in 11 new studies. The \nsecond application of the snowballing method resulted in 7 \nnew studies. Although continuing to apply this technique in \nthese 7 new studies is expected from this research, it has not \nyet been possible due to time restrictions.  \nC. Further Research \nThe previously discussed limitations offer clear paths to nfurther research. The utilization of the snowballing method \nin the 7 new studies can enrich the information collected so \nfar on Version Conrol in DSD projects, with the \nempowerment of the evidence on the challenges and already \nlisted solutions, as well as new proposals. \nBesides, given the limited number of industrial reports, \nthe conduction of a survey in software companies with \ndistributed projects to identify how they perform the version \ncontrol may display clearer conclusions on how Version \nControl is performed in Distributed Software Development. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThe authors would like to thank CAPES, CNPq, and \nFAPERJ for the financial support. \n \nREFERENCES \n[1]  E.

The spacecraft structure could not be \nan adequate Faraday cage due to the large number of \npenetrations required. \nElectronics boxes were fabricated without joints where \npossible close-outs were sealed with EMI gaskets or EMI \ntape. Assemblies that were constrained to use high-density nD-connectors that leak emissions at L-band were treated \nwith conductive overwrap to provide a complete covering. \nPedestals for connectors on the C&DH assembly were \nadded to aid overwrap application, and a cover plate was \nadded to seal the gaps between faceplates of the individual \ncards in the box \(Figure 19 added other provisions to address EMC including a \ncabling design that assures a continuous Faraday cage nbetween electronics boxes using twisted wire pairs with a \nshielded jacket \(TPSJ TPSJ \nwith Laird tape provides better shielding at L-band than \nTPSJ with copper braid overwrap. Because radiated \nemissions can be directional and connectors are often a \nsource, the ICE was configured so that the connectors \npointed away from the reflector to further attenuate \nemissions that could reflect interfere with science \ninstruments. The BAPTA was identified by modeling to be a \nlikely source of leakage; therefore, the observatory structure \nabove the BAPTA was designed as a Faraday cage and the \nrotation pathway for emissions was directed into the \nspacecraft interior where any emissions would less likely \ninterfere with science measurements. \nExisting inherited designs \(most of the commercial space \nassemblies used on SMAP accepted without \nadditional modifications for EMC. EMC requirements were \nlevied on these assemblies but with the recognition some \nmay be found non-compliant. In these cases, SMAP will use \ntraditional EMI/EMC control techniques during integration \nand test in order to control emissions \(adding EMI tape or \ncloth to cover possible areas of leakage performs the \nkey on-orbit operations needed to implement the conical \nscanning scheme employed for data acquisition by the radar \nand radiometer. The observatory uses a zero momentum bias, \ndual-spin architecture to rotate its large antenna at a spin rate \nof 13–14.5 rpm, while the spacecraft bus provides a three-axis ncontrolled platform that maintains both itself and the \ninstrument section’s spin axis in a nadir-pointed orientation. \nThe major pointing and control functional aspects and design \ncharacteristics are illustrated in Figure 20. A key challenge \nFigure 18. EMC requirement in the radiometer band for \nassemblies outside the spacecraft structure. Inside the \nstructure, the lower limit is relaxed by 6 dB. \n \nFigure 20.

In \na recent operational example of a nadir-pointing observatory \nemploying a momentum-compensated rotating antenna, \nWindSat/Coriolis, a dedicated momentum wheel was also \nused to counteract the antenna’s angular momentum, in a \nmanner similar to that planned for NROSS [21]. SMAP’s napproach provides a degree of functional redundancy for \nwheel failure and reduces control complexity nFigure 22 shows the system architecture, encompassing the \nattitude and spin rate determination functions attitude \ncontrol modes for both RWA and Reaction Control System \n\(RCS momentum \ncompensation, and the torque rod-based scheme employed \nfor RWA momentum management.

resonance effects. Frequency \ndistribution of these system components is shown in Figure \n23 to illustrate this aspect of the design. The minimum 1st \nflexible mode frequencies of the solar array, as well as the nantenna and boom, became key design requirements on the \nstructure to ensure adequate separation from the spin control \nsystem and the observatory’s attitude control bandwidth. \n \nFigure 22. Pointing and control system architecture. \n \nFigure 21. Observatory sensor and actuator description.\n  15\n10. LAUNCH VEHICLE CHALLENGES \nThe launch vehicle selection process for SMAP involved \nboth programmatic and technical challenges to develop an \nobservatory design that was compatible with several \npotential medium- and large-class launch vehicles and to \naccommodate a launch vehicle selection late in the design \nlifecycle without stretching the development schedule or \ndelaying the launch ready date. SMAP’s strategy effectively \nisolated the observatory design from launch vehicle \nuncertainty by applying very conservative bounding design \nloads and environments designing to the most constraining \nfairing volume, and by developing a flexible launch vehicle \nadapter design to address vehicle-specific interface and \nmission design differences after launch vehicle selection nWhen SMAP began Formulation in September 2008, there \nwas a dearth of suitable, affordable medium-class launch \nvehicles commercially available [23]. SMAP was too \nmassive to be lofted on a Taurus XL. Delta II production \nhad been halted. The Falcon 9 had not yet flown. Evolved \nexpendable-class launch vehicles \(EELVs were costly and \ngrossly over-capable for SMAP, and SMAP’s tall stowed \nconfiguration effectively eliminated it as a co-manifest \noption on an EELV. The situation was further complicated \nbecause NASA’s Launch Services Program \(LSP NLS-2 new contract would be in \nplace and which vehicles would be initially available in the \ntimeframe SMAP expected a launch vehicle selection. \nThe Project also simultaneously explored whether a \npartnership with the DOD Space Test Program \(STP DOD agencies have high interest in \nusing SMAP data in their applications [3] and were strong \nadvocates to the STP for such a partnership. Under such a \npartnership, the DOD might have earlier access to critically nneeded soil moisture and freeze-thaw data to support their \napplications and NASA would realize a substantially lower \nmission cost. STP has occasional access to EELVs and more \nfrequent access to Minotaur IV vehicles. The Minotaur IV \nuses components with a significant flight heritage such as \nsurplus Peacekeeper stages, a Taurus fairing and attitude \ncontrol system, and a mix of Minotaur I, Pegasus, Taurus, \nand other Orbital Sciences standard avionics and software \n[24]. The use of surplus Peacekeeper stages means the nvehicle was defined by NASA to be a non-commercial \nlaunch system under the Commercial Space Act and ntherefore, it is not available for NASA acquisition. The Act \nallows for Minotaur use by DOD under certain ncircumstances that appeared potentially allowable for SMAP \nunder a DOD partnership. The Minotaur IV had not yet \nflown at that time, but it appeared to be a good potential \nmatch for SMAP. The potential cost benefit to NASA of a \nDOD partnership was substantial, especially given the \nuncertainties in the commercial acquisition process, and for \na time, the DOD partnership track seemed like the most \nlikely prospect for a launch vehicle for SMAP. For these \nreasons, SMAP strove to develop an observatory that \nmaintained Minotaur IV compatibility \(the “+” variant \nreplaces the Orion 38 upper stage with a Star 48 which \nprovides more lift capability preliminary and then \ndetailed final design until CDR in July 2012, when NASA \nannounced selection of a Delta II launch vehicle for SMAP. \nPersistent launch vehicle uncertainty drove SMAP towards \nmission and observatory designs that maintained \ncompatibility with several launch vehicles: Minotaur IV+, \nAtlas V, Falcon 9 and then later the Delta II when it was on-\nramped onto NLS-2 in October 2011. In most aspects, the \nMinotaur IV represented the most constraining vehicle \nchoice. The largest drivers were its 92-in fairing, and its lift ncapability constraint and non-restartable upper stage, which \nlimited its final orbit insertion capability for SMAP. \nTypically in early formulation before launch vehicle \nselection, missions employ enveloping and highly margined \ndesign environments for compatibility with likely launch \nvehicles. Launch vehicle selection is typically completed by \nmission PDR so that as the observatory enters the final \ndesign phase, expected launch load requirements decrease \naround the selected vehicle and maturing coupled loads and \nmission analyses. The easing of requirements allows fewer \ndesign iterations \(margin is ‘cashed in’ to address problems \n \nFigure 23. Frequency separation is the key to meet stability and performance requirements while not responding to \ndisturbances.  \n  16\nthat arise in the detailed design and highly margined loads environment \npersisted through the entire design lifecycle, which in turn \ndrove more design iterations to insure the design was \ncompatible with the higher loads cases. \nThe 92-in fairing constraint significantly drove the \nobservatory packaging to achieve a compact design. The \nspacecraft bus underwent several design iterations to package \navionics, power, and radar electronics designs as the 


nassociated electronics packaging designs matured, while also \naccommodating commercial space assemblies for other \nsubsystems [transponders, transmitters, miniature inertial \nmeasurement unit \(MIMUs etc The packaging \nrequirements contributed to decisions to develop the NVM \nslice within the C&DH to avoid having to accommodate a \nseparate solid state data recorder assembly. Harness design \nwas a challenge to accommodate difficult bends and close \nclearances. The structure design was also optimized to reduce \nmass to insure healthy margins against the Minotaur IV+ lift \ncapability. The spacecraft structure was designed with 7050 naluminum alloy and the structure includes a number of \nmachined cutouts and thin walls that are time-consuming to \nfabricate. Thermal control was also a challenge in such a \nsmall bus due to the power dissipations \(~1400 W complexity; but nearly every available exterior \nsurface is used as a radiator. \nPerhaps most significantly impacted by the 92-in fairing \nconstraint were the stowed RBA and solar array packaging. \nThe RBA has been the most sensitive assembly to launch \nvehicle uncertainty, undergoing several design iterations to \naddress stowed packaging and launch loads, and thermal \ndesign iterations to address evolving launch phase mission ndesign scenarios. The RBA along with the spin assembly is \nso intimately coupled to the observatory’s fundamental \narchitecture that these contracts were initiated early in Phase \nA; however the RBA is now the last flight assembly to be \ndelivered to observatory integration and test, less than one \nyear before launch because the start of flight manufacturing \nwas delayed until the design work could be stabilized and nconfirmed for the selected launch vehicle. \nThe solar array design was also driven by the 92-in fairing nconstraint. Unusually, SMAP’s solar array has no exposed \ncells when stowed. Because of the small bus size the \nadjacent sizes of the spacecraft to the solar array central \npanel are ‘busy’ and close clearances to the fairing envelope \nwould not allow for a ‘wrap around’ solar panel stowage \napproach. The solar array folds over on itself, placing the \noutboard cells facing inward. This feature places high \nemphasis on ensuring there are robust battery energy \nmargins available to accommodate solar array deployment \ncontingencies following launch vehicle separation. \nThe mission design for orbit insertion was also developed \ninitially around the Minotaur IV+ vehicle capability. The \nMinotaur IV+ upper stage is not restartable and to naccommodate disposal requirements, the initial target \nspecification placed the upper stage/observatory in an nelliptical orbit \(566 x 664 km timeframe, but \ndrove the spacecraft propulsion system to accommodate the \nadditional delta V \(and propellant capacity 685 km also enabled the maximum achievable \ndry mass on-orbit for the observatory, subject to the need for \n80-kg propellant tank capacity on board the spacecraft. \nTo accommodate the Delta II selection, the existing Launch nVehicle Adapter \(LVA interfaces \n\(Figure 24 upper stage is restartable, \nthe mission design was adapted to directly inject SMAP into \nits final science orbit. Additional secondary batteries were \nadded to the LVA to provide appropriate power margins \nduring the longer coast phase until separation and solar \narray deployment places the spacecraft on internal power n\(Minotaur IV+ injection time was 16 minutes, Delta II is 60 \nminutes increased mass and fairing \nvolume resources than the Minotaur IV+; unfortunately, \nwhen the Delta II was selected, the SMAP design was \n \nFigure 24. SMAP’s launch vehicle adapter design \naccommodates changes needed for late launch vehicle \nselection. \n  17\nmature and many subsystems were well into fabrication. It \nwas not cost effective to iterate through another design cycle \nto take advantage of the additional resources. The added \ndesign and development effort to remain compliant with the \nMinotaur IV+ have ultimately allowed SMAP to \naccommodate a late launch vehicle selection without \nstretching out the development schedule or launch ready \ndate, thereby allowing SMAP to retain its October 2014 \nlaunch ready date despite the launch vehicle uncertainty. \n11. LESSONS LEARNED \nSMAP has significantly benefited from the experience and \nlessons from Aquarius and SMOS for the science \nmeasurements and instrument design, and from MSL for the \navionics and power subsystem architectures. Personnel from \nthese predecessor missions were engaged early in SMAP’s ndevelopment so that their insight and lessons learned could \nbe integrated into the early architectural design stages. \nKey lessons learned from SMAP include: \n\(1 nplanned scenarios very early with regulatory functions \nand key stakeholders. Spaceborne L-band science nradars operate as secondary users within their allocated \nspectrum. The primary users, civil and defense aircraft \nterrestrial navigation systems, are increasingly wary \nabout potential interference from secondary users. \nSMAP conducted significant analysis and testing to \ndemonstrate very low interference risk potential 


and \ncoordinated the results with these users early. SMAP \nmade significant modifications to the radar design and \noperating approach to effectively eliminate risk of \ninterference to primary spectrum users. \n\(2 the launch vehicle early; this is particularly \nimportant for new observatory designs where the \nnumber of design iterations can be driven by assumed \nconstraints and conservative bounding environments \n\(especially if they persist into detail design packaging, repackaging to \nremain within fairing envelope, for instance iterations, and mission design \niterations to accommodate various launchers before a \nfinal launch selection was made. This was unavoidable \nfor SMAP given SMAP’s launch vehicle and other \ncircumstances.  \n\(3 Integrated observatory design—spacecraft and \ninstrument—SMAP is a highly integrated design that \nuniquely leverages spacecraft capabilities to simplify \ninstrument design and operation. This resulted in lower noverall design complexity and has also allowed for a \nmore reliable design by reducing the number of npossible major failure modes.  \n\(4 new design insights incrementally \nunfold and thereby often reveal new issues to be \nresolved within the design. Occasional team ‘resets’ \nwere imposed to reassess local requirements and design \ncomplexity within the context of the overall observatory \ndesign. These ‘resets’ often resulted in significant \nsimplification and in reduced development risk and \nuncertainty. \n\(5 napply resources to mature these design areas, and \nqualify critical essential electronics parts and nsubassemblies to reduce downstream risk. SMAP \nsuccessfully did this, aggressively applying resources to nradar, radiometer, avionics, spin/dynamics and control, \nand the RBA—the key development challenges for the nmission. As described earlier, the RBA and spin \nassemblies’ designs were fundamental to the \narchitectural definition and to enabling preliminary \ndesign to proceed, so these were selected early in \nFormulation and placed under contract. This reduced \nsubsystem architectural- and system-level redesign \ncycles that can set back progress. \n12. CONCLUSION \nThe SMAP observatory has been carefully designed to \naddress a number of unique challenges posed by the mission \nobjectives: \n? Achieving global coverage every 2–3 days with a single ninstrument and observatory \n? Achieving both high resolution and high soil moisture \naccuracy \n? Minimizing data loss or corruption from L-band \nterrestrial RFI \n? Using a deployable mesh reflector for L-band nradiometric measurements \n? Mechanical packaging of the large instrument antenna \nand spacecraft, with its associated structural design \ncompatibility with several small-to-medium class launch \nvehicles and to accommodate a relatively late vehicle \nselection without delaying launch. \n? Fault protection approach to minimize science \nmeasurement on-orbit down-time \n? Adapting planetary heritage avionics to an Earth science nmission application \n? Design for EMC to avoid L-band emissions that could \ndegrade science measurements \n Dynamics and pointing control of a large deployable \nspinning reflector \nThe design ensures that SMAP will provide high-quality \nscience data. \n  18\nREFERENCES \n[1] “Earth Science and Applications from Space: National nImperatives for the Next Decade and Beyond,” \nCommittee on Earth Science and Applications from \nSpace: A Community Assessment and Strategy for the \nFuture, National Research Council, The National \nAcademic Press 2007.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles. The package totals 218.2 kg which includes four remote units, five instruments, one hub, and the carrier container\(s Table 5.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual

Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
