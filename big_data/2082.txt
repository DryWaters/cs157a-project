big challenge for wireless communications The QoS experienced by the multimedia trafﬁc is subject to the time-variant characteristics of the wireless channels In this paper a cross-layer algorithm is proposed to combat the wireless channel variation by adjusting the multimedia codec settings according to the MAC frame error rate in real-time The proposed algorithm is computational efﬁcient and the numerical experiments show that the cross-layer algorithm indeed achieves better performance even for the wireless channels in severe 
conditions 1 Introduction Since the introduction of the 802.11 wireless local area network WLAN the technology has achieved tremendous success due to its convenience of accessing the Internet The introduction of the 802.11a and 802.11g further increased the transmission rate and thus made real-time multimedia transmission over WLAN a practical application However the quality of service QoS requirements such as delay packet loss rate etc need to be constantly maintained to provide high 
quality multimedia transmission services Due to the time-varying channel characteristics in wireless environments it is a big challenge to constantly maintain the QoS of wireless multimedia transmission services Researchers have investigated several schemes to combat the inherent time-varying channel when transmitting multimedia trafﬁc In work Haratchere v et al propose a link adaptation algorithm to adjust the MAC transmission rate based on the channel state information CSI observed The adaptation criterion is 
obtained through experiment and the dynamics of the channel variation is not taken into account Fallah et al in  deri v e t he optimal MA C f rame size for t ransmission The work suggests that slicing the video data at the application layer rather than at the MAC layer can result in better video quality The dynamic characteristics of wireless channel are not considered in this work either In  B ucciol et al s uggest t hat the most perceptual packets should be of higher priority in 
retransmission The resulting PSNR is 1.5 dB better than the conventional MAC ARQ schemes However the scheme requires the priority of the streaming packets to be calculated beforehand  and thus not possible to support live multimedia streaming In Khan et al investigate the case in which a server serves three clients Different PHY/codec setting combinations of the clients are simulated to obtain the distortion experienced by each client The scheme then determines the PHY/codec settings of all users by choosing the com 
bination that jointly optimizes the PSNR of all clients Since the scheme also requires simulation beforehand it is not possible to be applied in real-time streaming Schaar et al propose a cross layer design in  which jointly considers the effects of the RS code/video packet size in the application layer the maximum MAC retry limit and the channel packet loss rate A simpliﬁed PSNR analysis is applied to determine the optimal system setting The work does not consider the dynamics of the channel variation either 
In this paper a cross-layer codec adaptation algorithm is developed Due to the short-term oscillation of CSI commonly seen in wireless environments it is our opinion that switching codec solely based on the instantaneous CSI or short-term averaged CSI could be overtuning the codec Instead we believe the codec setting should be adjusted by taking the possible channel variation behaviors in the near future into consideration As 
 


a result the proposed algorithm in this work uses the MAC frame error rate observed in certain period as the codec setting switching criteria In each observation period which consists of a xed number of MAC frame transmissions the observed frame error rate FER is compared to a set of pre-determined threshold values to determine the codec setting for the next observation period The major achievement in this work is to analytically nd the codec switching thresholds that optimize the expected PSNR As previously mentioned the major distinctive part of our work from the existing works is that the proposed scheme considers the channel variation behaviors in the next observation period This is done by deriving the FER distribution of each observation period from the possible state transition behaviors of the nite state Markov channel model FSMC in each observation period The expected PSNR can then be obtained from the FER distribution and thus optimized by setting the codec switching thresholds judiciously The optimal threshold values can be calculated ofﬂine to support real-time multimedia streaming This scheme does not pose any restrictions on the codec It can be applied to any codec with PSNR versus frame error rate simulated ofﬂine Numerical experiments show that the derived PSNR analysis matches well with the simulated PSNR and the proposed algorithm signiﬁcantly improves the PSNR by 5 dB The remainder of the paper is organized as follows In Section 2 the system model is described In Section 3 the cross-layer codec adaptation algorithm is described and the PSNR analysis required for determining the optimal codec switching threshold values is also presented In Section 4 numerical results are demonstrated to show the effectiveness of the proposed codec adaptation algorithm Finally conclusions are given in Section 5 2 System Model 2.1 Protocol Stack The protocol stack of our cross-layer design is shown in Figure 1 The raw data is rst compressed by H.264 codec at the media server and then fragmented into packets with real-time transport protocol RTP header combined Each RTP header contains a time stamp for packet-loss detection at the client end The packets are then sent to UDP/IP layer and then to the 802.11 MAC layer for transmission In 802.11 the stop-andwait SW ARQ mechanism is used which supports up to three retransmissions when CRC errors are detected The wireless channel layer is modeled by FSMC which is further addressed in Section 2.2 At the client end the  H.264 Encoder Changes Codec Setting RTP Layer UDP/IP Data Link Layer FSMC Channel Model for WLANs UDP/IP Data Link Layer RTP Layer H.264 Decoder Error Concealment Media Server Client Timestamp for Video Packet Report the Lost Packet by Timestamp ACK or NAK MAC Frame Retransmission Cross-Layer Codec Adaptation Objective Perceived Quality, PSNR Statistics MAC Frame Error Rate Measurement Figure 1 The cross-layer optimized protocol stack for wireless H.264 video transmissions inverse procedures are conducted to decode the video frames In this work we use H.264 codec and the simulated H.264 PSNR versus MAC FER is shown in Figure 2 Note that PSNR is generally deﬁned as PSNR  10 log 255 2 1 MN  M  1 i 0  N  1 j 0  x ij   x ij  2  1 where M N represent the size of the frame and x ij   x ij represent the original value and the reconstructed value of the pixel respectively The gure indicates that the video quality degrades as the MAC FER grows The crossovers also reveal the potential PSNR improvement by FER-based codec adaptation 2.2 Channel Model FSMC is widely used to model the wireless channel of WLAN which matches well with the actual channel measurement experiments  1 In this w o rk w e consider the wireless channel model proposed in The channel SNR  is quantized to several channel states as shown in Figure 3 The channel is said to be in state w k if    w k   w k 1   where the dividing points   w k  are determined so that the average sojourn time is the same for each channel state k  In our numerical experiments it is observed that when the channel condition is poor the codec is stuck to certain setting and the codec adaptation has little contribution to the expected PSNR As a result the codec adaptation is designed to be activated only when the channel condition is above certain threshold  w T  The resulting FSMC can be obtained by replacing the channel SNR probability density function

state transition time is the length of one observation period  M MAC frame transmissions and the state o i w j indicates that the codec setting o i is used for the M frames in the observation period with the wireless channel in state w j at the beginning of the observation period i.e the rst MAC frame transmission Note that the wireless channel does not necessarily stay in w j during the whole observation period It might transit to other channel states during the remaining M  1 frame transmissions of the observation period following the FSMC model in Section 2.2 Based on the codec adaptation algorithm described in Section 3.1 the transition probability can be derived as P o 1 w i o 1 w j  3  k 1  MT 1  2   l 0 F w i,k  l  P w k,j  P o 1 w i o 2 w j  3  k 1 M  l   MT 1  2  1 F w i,k  l  P w k,j  P o 2 w i o 1 w j  3  k 1  MT 2  1   l 0 F w i,k  l  P w k,j  P o 2 w i o 2 w j  3  k 1  MT 2  3   l   MT 2  1  1 F w i,k  l  P w k,j  P o 2 w i o 3 w j  3  k 1 M  l   MT 2  3  1 F w i,k  l  P w k,j  P o 3 w i o 2 w j  3  k 1  MT 3  2   l 0 F w i,k  l  P w k,j  P o 3 w i o 3 w j  3  k 1 M  l   MT 3  2  1 F w i,k  l  P w k,j  7 where i j  1  2  3   and F w i,k  l  represents the probability that l erroneous frames occur among the M frames given that the rst frame of the observation period encountering channel state w i and the last of the M frame encountering channel state w k  Detailed derivation of F w i,k  l  using factorial moment generating function FMGF is further illustrated in Section 3.3 Here we explain how the transition probability expressions above are obtained Take P o 1 w i o 1 w j for example If the codec setting of the current observation period is o 1 and the codec setting remains to be o 1 in the next observation period this indicates that the number of erroneous MAC frames l in the current observation period is less than  MT 1  2  so that the resulting FER l  M is less than T 1  2 to keep the codec setting unchanged This explains the summation of l in the expressions Also for the wireless channel state to transit from w i in the rst frame of the current observation period to w j in the rst frame of the next observation period the channel state can transit to any state  w k  at the end of the current observation period the M th MAC frame and then transit to w j in one frame duration This is why the expression sums up F w i,k  l  P w k,j for all possible k  The other expressions can be interpreted with similar intuition Once we compute F w i,j  l  i,j  1  2  3 from the analysis in Section 3.3 the transition probabilities in 7 are obtained One can then solve for the steady state probabilities of the Markov chain Denote the steady state probabilities by    o 1 w 1  o 1 w 2  o 1 w 3  o 2 w 1  o 2 w 2  o 2 w 3  o 3 w 1  o 3 w 2  o 3 w 3   8 With the PSNR function  i  x  of each codec setting deﬁned in Section 3.1 the expected PSNR can be computed as PSNR   o 1 w 1  3  i 1 M  j 0 F w 1 i  j  1  j/M   o 1 w 2  3  i 1 M  j 0 F w 2 i  j  1  j/M   o 1 w 3  3  i 1 M  j 0 F w 3 i  j  1  j/M   o 2 w 1  3  i 1 M  j 0 F w 1 i  j  2  j/M   o 2 w 2  3  i 1 M  j 0 F w 2 i  j  2  j/M   o 2 w 3  3  i 1 M  j 0 F w 3 i  j  2  j/M   o 3 w 1  3  i 1 M  j 0 F w 1 i  j  3  j/M   o 3 w 2  3  i 1 M  j 0 F w 2 i  j  3  j/M   o 3 w 3  3  i 1 M  j 0 F w 3 i  j  3  j/M   9 From the expected PSNR analysis above one can apply numerical optimization method to nd the optimal switching thresholds  T i,i  1 T i,i 1  for the FERbased cross-layer codec adaptation algorithm

Figure 7. Comparison of MDs of test system with baseline CPU performance-related parameters in the MD analysis fell beyond the threshold bound almost entire test time \(i.e 56% below lower bound and 42% above upper bound did not had the highest  MD  which suggested that there might be a problem with the CPU and should be analyzed further. The correlation coefficient analysis showed that the CPU performance parameters were not strongly correlated with the fan or temperature parameters. Whereas, a strong positive correlation \(correlation coefficient &gt; 0.75 the fan and temperature parameters was observed. The S/N ratio estimation suggested that the parameters related to CPU performance were of least importance in MD calculation. These two analyses suggested that CPU performance parameters were not causing the faults and thus were not considered as faulty. The results presented in Table 4 indicate that fan speed was the most likely faulty parameter because the fan parameter had highest PFP, and the fan speed was correlated with the temperature parameters At the 2,700th data point \(Figure 7 observed because the computer shutdown by itself and was then restarted manually. This resulted in temporary fan start-up and a drop in three temperatures. However, these temperatures were above the nominal/expected value of the CPU and video card temperatures during that period Therefore, these temperatures were identified as anomalous as well. Intuitively, if the fan were not functioning well, the temperature of the system would rise and become abnormally high. Manual investigation of the data set also indicated that the fan was not functioning well and that the three monitored temperatures were higher than the nominal temperature values by ~10  C. Therefore, it can be affirmed that this new approach did identify the faulty parameter of the computer Table 4.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS A new fault isolation approach that utilizes the Mahalanobis distance has been demonstrated. The work expands the 7 applicability of the Mahalanobis distance from detection to fault isolation. In the literature, unhealthy system data has been used to scale MD values for fault isolation. In the new approach presented in this paper, data from an unhealthy system is not required; rather, a threshold bound based on healthy training data for each parameter is defined considering design of analysis \(DoA strength of the MD method is that it preserves all the information available because it does not reduce the dimensionality of the data A set of experiments was conducted to establish the  healthy  or  normal  operation on a set of notebook computers subjected to a range of usages and environmental conditions. A field-returned computer was evaluated in situ using Mahalanobis distance techniques. The Mahalanobisdistance-based faulty parameter identification method was used to identify the fault and the related key parameters for 


used to identify the fault and the related key parameters for root cause analysis of the anomalies. Four important parameters  fan speed and three temperature components CPU temperature, motherboard temperature and video card temperature  were identified for health estimation using the MD method. In the analysis of a field-returned computer using the suggested fault isolation approach, the fan speed parameter was identified as being faulty and verfied later The results showed that the suggested approach could be used for quick fault detection at a system level, and the same distance measure can also be used for faulty parameter isolation ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work is sponsored by the members of the CALCE Prognostics and Health Management Consortium at the University of Maryland, College Park REFERENCES 1] M.

well as from practitioners, is available, IL strategy including DWH/BI strategy IL strategies are addressed at all, either actual artifacts/documents are proposed without an integrating meta model/methodology, or the strategy making process is described without proposing specific and consistent result templates/structures Since it consumes a significant amount of resources and may constitute significant potentials for business, IL needs strategy. IL strategy must not be limited to hardware/software selection and architectural considerations, but should address the entire business scope of sourcing services, integrating acquired and self-made services into customer-oriented IL solutions, and delivering such solutions to create customer value Our survey of the state of IL strategy in practice reveals that IL sourcing, IL delivery and IL portfolio strategies are regarded as important strategy components. The larger companies are, the more international their focus is, and the more their IL is organized according to the CC model, the more components of a supply-chain oriented explicit IL strategy they are likely to have deployed The IIM model provides a suitable conceptual foundation for structuring such strategy components and also provides best practices from IT management which often can be easily adapted to IL. Regarding IL product/service development and maintenance certain functional oriented strategy sub-components are differentiated in our framework. These strategy components are adapted from an established data management functional framework in order to reflect IL specifics. While traditional, more technically oriented sub-components such as system and data architecture are covered in most companies, business oriented components like change management and project/business requirements management are covered less frequently. Additional research is necessary to develop appropriate solution components based on existing fragments and experiences Based on a more complete comprehension of IL strategy and its components, the strategy development and update process needs to be addressed in future research as well. Instead of developing and updating business strategies, IT strategies and IL strategies in independent processes, dependencies and cycles need to be addressed. A comprehensive understanding of IL strategy and respective processes may also serve as a foundation for establishing maturity models, reference models and best practices  References 1] Arnott, D. and G.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
