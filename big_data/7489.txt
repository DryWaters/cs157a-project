To prevent cyber victimization from the activity is challenging. This paper enhanced the Na\357ve Bayes classifier for extracting the words and examining loaded pattern clustering. The algorithm included two main methods: \(1 creating partitions by iteratively relocating from entire datasets into clusters using k-mean clustering and \(2\any specific partition with the freque ncy of words with multinomial model feature vector and drawing the probability of words occurring in a document for p redicting the eight classes. The proposed method resulted in increasing accuracy and reliability of an experiment Keywords- Cyberbullying Prevention; Big Data Streaming Na\357ve Bayes classifier; Pattern Clustering I  I NTRODUCTION Due to the advances of internet and information technology, Online Social Network \(OSN Facebook, Twitter, and MySpace are gaining in popularity as a main source of spreading messages to other people. Messaging is widely used and very useful in various purposes, for example, business, education and socialization. However, it also provides opportunity to cr eate harmful activities. There are numerous evidences showing that messaging can introduce the very concerned problem, namely cyberbullying Cyberbullying involves the offe nsive information such as harassment, insult, and hate in the messages which are sent or post using OSN services for th e purpose of intentionally hurting people emotionally, me ntally, or physically I t can cause low self-esteem, anxiety depression, a variety of other emotional problem Its tragic consequences have continuously reported typically among the school-age children. Since the number of cyberbullying experiences has recently been  of how to effectively detect a nd prevent it from happening in real time manner is urgently needed. To prevent victims from the incidents, blocking the mess age is not an effective way Instead, texts in the messages should be monitored, processed and analyzed as quickly as possi ble in order to support real time decisions As the problems mentioned, a number of studies are dedicated to explore various te chniques to detect cyberbullying efficiently. Manual detection is considered the most accurate detection, but it is hardly employed because it takes too much time and lots of resources. Au tomatic cyberbullying detection system is therefore emphasized. Text mining technology and technique are mo  applied m u lti classifiers such as Na\357ve Bayes, JRip, J48 and SMO with YouTube comm d L D A to e x tract features and employ weighted term frequency-inverse document frequency \(TF-IDF\unction to improve the classification with datasets from Kongregate, Slashdot, and MySpace. Homa used Support Vector Machines classifier with datasets from Instagram and Roms Maximization \(EM\ for clustering documents from data streams for threat cyberbullying detection Even though cyberbullying detection system has extensively been exploring cyberbullying remains a growing concern and the existing approaches are still inadequate especially when dealing with a large volume of data. Various kinds of OSN services can represent different forms or patterns of data. Additionally, reduction in computation time becomes very crucial. The detection of cyberbullying is therefore still challenging This paper, we developed an automatic cyberbullying detection system to detect, iden tify, and classify cyberbullying activities from the large volume of streaming texts from OSN services. Texts are fed into cluster and discriminant analysis stage which is able to identify abusive texts. The abusive texts are then clustered by using K-Mean. Na\357ve Bayes is used as classification algorithms to build a classifier from our training datasets and build a predictive model. Moreover, we also used Na\357ve Bayes to classify the abus ive texts into one of the eight pre-defined categories. The categories include activities approach, communicative, de sensitization, compliment isolation, personal information, reframing, and relationship Our proposed approach consists of two main methods. The first method aims to clean and pre-proce ss our datasets by removing non-printable and special characters, reducing the duplicate words and clustering the datasets. The second one concerns 978-1-4673-9077-4/17/$31.00 \2512017 IEEE 242 


classification model to predict th e text messages for preventing cyberbullying In our experiment, the datasets of streaming texts are collected from two different types of sources: \(1\ed messages by members in Perverted-justice used as training datasets, and \(2\sets from Stanford University as testing datasets. The main goal of our research is to improve accuracy of our automatic cyberb ullying detection system and to process and analyze texts in nearby real time. However, the cyberbullying is detected. The fa ster the action is taken, the more the victims are safe The rest of the paper is orga nized as follows. Section II presents related researches on techniques used in automatic cyberbullying detec tion system. Section III describes our proposed methodology, and then followed by the detail of our experiment and its results as well as discussion on its potential and limitations in Section IV. Section V presents the conclusion with proposed ideas and how to improve our system as future work II  LITERATURE  REVIEW This section reviews the relev ant researches related to cyberbullying prevention, big da ta streaming, Na\357ve Bayes classifier, and pattern clustering A  Cyberbullying Prevention According to the accumulated literature, cyberbullying can be defined as the use of electronic forms of communication by an individual or group to invo lve repeatedly in posting or forwarding content about an indi vidual or group that a regular person would consider threatening, embarrassing, or harassing 9. Som e of the m o st co mm on form s of cyberbullying are forwarding someone\222s private e-mails to others, sending threatening or inappropriate me ssages via instant messaging and hacking into another person\222s account to send unsuitable content to others via social network sites. In addition cyberbullying is especially deceptive because it affords a degree of anonymity and the opportunity to reach a greater amount of victims without a s ubstantial threat of penalty There are a number of empirical studies regarding cyberbullying prevention that disc lose the approaches for state and local governments, students, and families to use when addressing cyberbullying [12. These appr oaches are classified into three main cate gories: \(1\regulations to control the use of the Internet and to establish policies related to cyberbullying and ot her methods of abuse, \(2 curricular programs considered to educate children and adolescence about safe using of the Internet and electronic media and how to avoid and address the consequences for cyberbullying, and \(3\ogical approaches to prevent the cyberbullying. This paper falls into the last category in which using Na\357ve Bayes classifier as a technological method, to extract the texts and examine clustering pattern, and to monitor text streams transmitted via the Internet B  Big Data Streaming The concept of a data stream is more suitable than a dataset Generally, a stored dataset is a proper model when significant portions of the data are queried repeatedly, and updates are small and quite rare. In the oppos ite, a data stream is a fit model when a huge volume of da ta is arriving uninterruptedly and it is unreasonable to store the data in some forms of memory. In addition, data streams are applicable as a model of access to big datasets stored in secondary memory in which performance requirements need access through linear scans 13-14 Past research in the data stream phenomenon has revealed the development of stream mining algorithms Henzi nger   w ed t h e attraction of data stream  to the attention of data mining community. They proposed two types of data stream mining algorithms: data-based and tasked-based techniques. There are a number of clustering, classification frequency counting and time series analysis have been conducted grounded by these two techniques. They also considered to the significant issues of data stream preprocessing and data stream mi ning technology. Another group of researchers also indicated that the data pre-processing is the method of designing a light-wei ght pre-processing techniques that assure the quality of the min   to this research was how a qu ality process was automated and integrated with the mining techniques C  Na\357ve Bayes Classifier A Na\357ve Bayes classifier uses the concept of probability to classify large volume of da ta by finding models that  class i fier  assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other features. The model can be applied to several kinds of problems, such as real time prediction, multi class predicti on, and text classification.

The po pular clustering model is namely K-means.

To perform the task of clustering, a variety of data mining tools is freely available. These tools have their own features to efficiently generate clusters automatically for a given set of A g nihot  use d cos i ne similarity for measuring the distance among the words to mining the important information from texts. K-means and hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm are used to form the clusters. Clustering is also applied with the multimodal crime patterns on the different modalities, which refer to the different data sources; offender data and weapon data. The GSVM has deployed for a hierar chical clustering approach by identifying patterns that exist in different levels of granularity for different modes of crime da  III  THE  ARCHITECTURE  OVERVIEW  AND  PROPOSED  METHOD Figure 1 illustrates the system that consists of four major steps; preparing dataset, genera ting clusters, training data, and predicting data. The details of each step are as follows First step, preparing dataset, data sources comes from the CyberCrime Data and Twitter across cluster networks from data streams Second step, generating clusters, data sources are clustered the features two categories of the messages as polite messages and abusive messages, which the contents of the messages are identified, based on a crime pattern and the normalized documents using K-means clustering technique. The K-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that is widespr ead for cluster analysis in data mining. It aims to do a partition of n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean for finding the word pattern frequency with N-Gram in each sentence Third step, training data, the abusive partition is used to transform each into the feature extractor for classification technique using on Na\357ve Bayes. We assigned the feature extractor into eight sub categories including; activities approach, communicative, de sensitization, compliment isolation, personal information reframing, and relationship The pairs of feature sets and labeled data are fed into the Na\357ve Bayes classifier to produce a model Final step, predicting data, the f eature sets are fetched into the model to produce predicted labels in eight categories For example, the message \223Oh girl, sexy so u wanna talk about underware??????//\224 is considered containing abusive content by K-means and it is classify by Na\357ve Bayes into Personal Information category; age, sex, and activity IV  EXPERIMENTAL  EVALUATION For these experiments, we used the CyberCrime Data which is a manually labeled dataset, for 170,019 posts from the perverted-justice dataset and Stan ford University dataset that collect from Twitter web site from July 2012 to Jan 2013 There are 467 million Twitter posts from 20 million users that consist of author, time and content. The datasets can be divided into eight clusters as follows 1\Activities approach, \(2 communicative, \(3\desensitization, \(4\compliment, \(5 isolation, \(6\personal info rmation, \(7\framing, and \(8 relationship. In this section, the evaluation approach and the evaluation results are elaborated and discussed in detail 244 


A  DataSet and Expermental Settings We used the CyberCrime Data and standard collection of Twitter dataset for training and testing the split data. Twitter include four direction networks that extracted from user activities including; re-tweeting replying to existing tweets mentioning other users, and being friends or followers as social relationships among users involve d in the above activities and twitter information during the data collection TABLE I  TWITTER TEXT CATEGORIZATION COLLECTION DATASET  Data Statistics Number of users 17,069,982 Number of tweets 476,553,560 Number of URLs 181,611,080 Number of Hashtags 49,293,684 Number of re-tweets 71,835,017  Table I illustrates documents of the Twitter categorization collection dataset in which they consisted of number users number of tweets, number of URLs, number of hashtags, and number of re-tweets during the seven months   The experiment was tested on HP - Compaq HP z620 Workstation \(12-DIMM slots\aster node. Our machine specification was as follows: the Intel C602 Chipset 8-channel ECC DDR3-1866 \(Transfer rates up to 1866 MT/s\hannels per CPU, and hard disk 12TB. We run on Hadoop flume Version 1.5.0 for streaming data flows based on Apache YARN \(for MR2\.3.0 framework. Hadoop Mahout 0.10.1 for executes the K-means and Na\357ve Bayes classifier algorithms   B  Experimental Results We conducted a maximum number of iterations of 20 \(to make a fair comparison\ algorithm.  Each experiment is running ten time s. We set the threshold of relevant strength between two words to 0.4. For each sentence we did training the data to optimize the sentiment word strengths that covered spelling correction, negating word list and repeating letters or punctuation and emotions. The Kmeans clustering was used to split data sources into an abusive cluster  a  002 0.005  b  002 0.02 Figure 2  b\and \(c\ve Bayes classification accuracy against feature set size for various values c\maximum number of iterations is 100 and the feature set is 200 features. There are three values being tested in this works, which are 0.005 0.01 and 0.02. Na\357ve Bayes was used for outperforming without the extended feature set by a lower margin of 0.7%. It performs less well than N-gram 223I love you\224, \223I love\224, \223love you\224 and \223I\224, \223love\224, you\224 with adding the pattern terms. Na\357ve Bayes performs the classification accuracy = 95.79% is already very high when using all features. All except accuracy are statistically significant difference. In terms of value, 0.02 tends to perform almost uniformly better than other valu es for this data set. When  0.02, relevant measure will c ontribute more than redundant measure, which means that the extracting method will focus more on improving classification accuracy than reducing the number of features We guaranteed the abusive messages by considering the recurring patterns within the whole datasets K-mean clustering patterns applied for assigning th e partitions of a set of objects into the k subclasses 245 002 0.01  c  


 Figure 3  The eight subclasses from four-category clusters Figure 3 shows the results of a dataset that was collected during 2012-1013 and categorized into eight classes based on four clusters. We found that k=4 produced the best results that follow from the Cyberbullying type \(Child Exploitation Money Laundering, Internet-base d Drug Trafficking, and Mass Marketing Fraud\on the results in Figure 3, the isolation, communicative, and reframing were the three highest score on normalized activity count. For example, both of the contributions "are you alone" a nd "do you have many friends are considered under the category of \223isolation.\224 TABLE II  EIGHT SUB CATEGORIES  Categories Sentences activities approach 223Are you safe to meet\224 communicative 223I just want to meet and mess around\224 desensitization 223if I don\222t cum right back\224 compliment 223You are a really cute girl\224 isolation 223Do you have many friends\224 personal information 223Oh girl, sexy so u wanna talk about underware??????//\224 reframing 223Let\222s have fun together\224 relationship 223are you married yet\224  Table II illustrates the sample coding in these experiments contained 475 unique phrases.  For example, we assigned the sentences as \223Let\222s have fun together\224, \223Let\222s play a make be lieve game\224, \223there is nothing wrong with doing that\224 for reframing category As illustrated in Figure 4, the codebook used as the baseline for defining the conversation dialogs based on the eight sub categories that were previously tested with PV1 and SafeChat.  In order to improve the accuracy, we executed ten times and repeated on the labeled datasets \(i.e., Twitter and CyberCrime\and on the unlabeled datasets based on eight subclasses. Considering the results of the Figure 4, we realized that when using PV1, the accuracy for clustering the conversation dialog \(in each sub category\labeled dataset was approximate to SafeChat and for the unlabeled dataset was increased 33.48%, respectively  Figure 4  Based line result for verification of PV1 Knowing that many other studies previously conducted in this field\merely used labeled datasets collected from SafeChat, we aimed to compare our results based on both labeled and unlabeled datasets through PV1 Consequently, the results of PV1 and the Codebook baseline approaches from SafeChat were less accurate dealing with the unlabeled datasets compared to the labeled datasets V  CONCLUSION  AND  FUTURE  WORK The main objective of the paper is to partition abusive messages from big data streaming with K-means clustering method on top of word probabilistic on each document for determining the similarity sentences score based on the improving accuracy and computation time. The paper proposes a novel method which can generate a predictive model from large volume of data sets for su pporting the analysis services on business. The primarily study is to enhance the features of a Na\357ve Bayes classifier for extracting the words and generating model on text streaming. Moreover, a local optimum is guaranteed by our proposed me thod. The method was executed on CyberCrime Data, which is a manually labeled dataset, for 170,019 posts and Twitter web site for 467 million Twitter posts The empirical results demonstrate that our method; \(1\ is able to classify abusive messages from sentences frequency by using statistics score and partition data sources, and \(2\ is capable of classification and pre diction model from the feature sets into eight sub categories as; activities approach communicative, desensitization, compliment, isolation personal information, reframing and relationship. However, in future we will study more on the streaming K-mean clustering using Apache Spark for increasing a performance of computation time and cost on the different data types from many data sets A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The author would like to acknowledge the financial support of this work by grants from Institute for Research and Development, Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University under the IRD 0522.25/58 program on 2015 R EFERENCES  1  Cyberbullying Research Center, 'What is Cyberbullying?', 2016 Online].

From the com   maintainability. It fully supports continuous delivery and development technology  C  ORK In this paper, we propose a new microservice IoT framework that has improved features than existing IoT system such as: monolithic and microserivce system. The proposed sys tem provides a more generic microservice IoT architecture on a module approach, it is much better than existing approaches in terms of flexibility, scalability and platform indepen dency. In addition, we have also introduced the functions of the key components and il lustrated their applications. In the proposed microservice IoT framework, all IoT devices and objects are abstracted as resource plugin inside the system The allocation of microservices to devices works dynamically by interacting with core ser vice, where the core service interacts with the device by using the related plugins, the device plugins can be mounted or unmounted dynami cally, upgradation of the plugins is also possible without affecting the overall system, or even the whole module of a microservice can be freely replaced. Thus, the system not only pro vides the best IoT service but also has a good support for the Web of Things and has stronger adaptability, scalability and interoperability For the practice of microservice architec ture, there are still many problems to be stud ied, such as cooperative transaction process ing, network delay, faults in network, message serialization and other issues.

R Mehmood et al  UTiLearn A Personalised Ubiquitous Teaching and Learning System for Smart Societies  are under threat in a continuing gloomy global economy while digital and lifelong learners are increasingly demanding new T&L paradigms There is a clear and urgent need to transform teaching and learning landscape in order to drive global economic growth The use of distance eTeaching and eLearning 050DTL\051 is on the rise among digital natives alongside our evolution towards smart societies However the DTL systems today lack the necessary sophistication due to several challenges including data analysis and management learner-system interactivity system cognition resource planning agility and scalability We also discussed the developments around future cities and smart societies and highlighted the fundamental need of developing knowledge and human and social capital for their enablement It was discussed that smart society developments would extend the role of learning from mainstream education for employment scope to the notion of social and collaborative governance where the society will collaborate to train each other in maintaining its knowledge moral 034ber good practice resilience competitiveness and for bringing innovation and becoming a knowledge-based economy The key to such efforts would be a converged ubiquitous infrastructure comprising many systems that share information among them and collaborate with each other as necessary We felt motivated by the challenges and opportunities surrounding the education industry and digital learners as well as the developments in urbanisation and proposed in this paper a Ubiquitous eTeaching  eLearning 050UTiLearn\051 Framework UTiLearn leveraged IoT big data supercomputing deep learning mobile computing and cloud computing to provide enhanced development management and delivery of teaching and learning in future city and smart society settings UTiLearn framework provides an environment and ecosystem for societies to enrich their knowledge anytime anywhere any age through improved processes for collection development accessibility pedagogy and cognition of knowledge Its users could be teachers students governments 050such as for cloud-based healthcare systems 101]\051 b usinesses third parties and virtual organisations or groups formed for speci\034c purposes A learner may register her preferences and the system advises her through to the completion of the learning task In addition to the usual functions of an MOOC a government department can develop speci\034c material to reach out to a group of people to create awareness of a topic for social intervention purposes The UTiLearn framework can run in a cloud and can be offered as a service UTLaaS A proof of concept implementation of the UTiLearn framework called the UTiLearn system comprising 034ve components was developed in the paper The 034ve components were described in details along with their functions methodologies algorithms implementation as well as their evaluation We used 11 widely used datasets for system evaluation The R statistical platform was used for the data analysis data quality management prediction and decision making The methods used included Na\357ve Bayes classi\034er Random Forest and DLANNs The experiments were carried out on the supercomputer Aziz Future work will focus on building additional capacity of the UTiLearn system in terms of the quality and functionality of the processes used in the various components of the system data quality management extension of big data related functionalities and IoT related functionalities A major issue in designing a real life UTiLearn system would be its data and information management We could bene\034t by the research and practice on designing sustainable enterprise information systems Our earlier work in this respect 103 would form the basis of our future direction on extending information management aspects of the UTiLearn system Another major issue in a scalable design of the UTiLearn system would be to deal with big data and computational load related issues Our research direction in this respect will rely on modelling analysis and design methods that leverage HPC technologies and are able to deal with big data such as our earlier work in and 10 5 The w ork on the UARI component in this paper has revealed that the human activity datasets available online are limited in their quality and extent We believe that in the future many more detailed and high quality datasets will be available to allow a better understanding of human activities across space and time Moreover systems like UTiLearn can record the activity data of the users and buildup its own datasets over time to have a better understanding of human activities to allow better optimisation of pedagogy human cognition delivery mode selections and required application traf\034c and network characteristics Additional work is also needed in 034nding and incorporating networking applications and system workload related datasets to be used in the SNPDP Component These are required to enhance the precision of the training computation and prediction of networking characteristics application traf\034c models and system models In this respect our earlier work on city transportation modelling evacuation and telematics such as in  w ould be useful both from activity recognition and learning point of view That is information learning and entertainment would be integrated and system optimization would bene\034t from all kinds of 050big\051 data Finally the use of computational and arti\034cial intelligence and human-machine interaction demands a careful look at the design of UTiLearn and similar systems There is need to consider the theory and practice of sociotechnical systems  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The experiments reported in this paper were performed on the Aziz supercomputer at KAU The authors
