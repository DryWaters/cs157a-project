I I NTRODUCTION The scale of data generated by modern scienti\002c applications is rapidly increasing ranging from terabyes at present to petabytes or exabytes down the road in the predictable future Such data now commonly termed as 223big data\224 can be resulted from various sources including simulations exper 
iments or observations and must be processed and analyzed in a timely manner for scienti\002c discoveries and inventions Among many existing methods for data analytics visualization has been well recognized and widely used in broad science communities to make sense of the data However the sheer volume of today's scienti\002c data has posed a daunting challenge on traditional visualization technologies and parallel visualization has proven to be a promising solution to handle data of such scales As a result many parallel visualization architectures have emerged in the last decade 15   1 6    7   13   1    1 9   As put forth by Molnar 
et al 
 according to the time when primitives in the raw data are sorted on their corre 
sponding processors parallel visualization architectures can be classi\002ed into three categories i.e sort-\002rst sort-middle and sort-last 14  A l t h o u g h t h e i n s t a n c e s i n e a c h c a t e g o r y m a y differ in their particular implementations they generally share some common features In sort-\002rst each primitive in the raw data is assigned to a certain processor which is responsible for a predivided region of the display screen This scheme could save network communications between the processors due to the predetermined locality of each primitive but may result in unbalanced workload among the processors due to the static screen partitioning In sort-last primitives are not assigned as strictly Instead they are rendered into pixels 
by the processors they are initially assigned to and these distributed pixels must be composited into a 002nal image This scheme may achieve a high level of workload balance at the cost of increased network communications In sort-middle the entire visualization process is naturally divided into two distinctive stages geometry processing and rasterization Such a partitioning of visualization groups together the operations with similar purposes and distinguishes from others This scheme may consume more bandwidth and incur a longer processing time and hence is investigated in more theoretical than practical settings Among the above three well-known parallel architectures sort-last is often preferred in many applications due to its 
adaptability to load balancing In general the sort-last architecture comprises of two stages rendering and composition 20  However one prominent issue associated with this scheme is the communication overhead caused by gathering and compositing partial pixels distributed among processors after the rendering stage As the data volume increases at an unprecedented pace more processors are needed to render larger image sizes in parallel which aggravates this composition latency issue and inevitably degrades the performance of the entire visualization process To address this performance limitation we propose a generalized Grouping More and Pairing Less GMPL method for image composition in sort-last parallel 
rendering GMPL is of two-fold novelty i It divides the processors into groups based on the prime factors of the total number of processors available in the system In doing so we are able to obviate the common power-of-two restriction in existing methods to fully utilize computing resources and break down the processors to the lowest level with a minimum number of peers in each group to achieve high concurrency and save communication cost 978-1-4799-3214-6/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 


operator 18  I n t h i s o p e r a t o r  t w o input pixels are combined with a ratio that depends on the 002rst input pixel's channel value which makes the operator non-commutable and imposes a limitation on the design of potential algorithms Among the order-independent methods the most widely used one is the Z-buffer algorithm proposed by Catmull and others 2   1 8   T h e b l e n d i n g r e s u l t o f t h i s method is only determined by the two input pixels distances to the view point i.e the one closer to the view point is taken as the resultant pixel It also means that the input order does not affect the blending result hence facilitating the design of more 003exible algorithms There also exist a wide range of research efforts in the aspect of work\003ow organization for image composition Among the most traditional ones the Binary Swap method proposed by Ma et al ii Within each group it employs an improved direct send method to narrow down each processor's pairing scope to further reduce communication overhead and increase composition ef\002ciency The performance superiority of the proposed GMPL image composition method over existing methods is evaluated through rigorous theoretical analysis and further veri\002ed by extensive experimental results on a high-performance visualization cluster II R ELATED W ORK As one key step in a sort-last parallel rendering system image composition has received a great deal of attention from many researchers Existing efforts mainly focus on the following two aspects of research i design blending methods to determine how input pixels should be combined and ii organize composition work\003ows for higher composition ef\002ciency with less resource consumption Blending methods can be divided into two categories i order-dependent methods and ii order-independent methods Among the order-dependent methods the most representative one is the Porter-Duff   which are interconnected through a local switch Each processor has a locally rendered image of an identical size homogeneous processors denoted as 013 N et al proposed the 2-3 swap composition method with the intention to generalize the original Binary Swap method 22  I n t h i s g e n e r a l i z e d m e t h o d  e a c h p r o c e s s o r i s i n i tially assigned a different number of pixels for composition As the process continues the difference in the number of pixels on each processor may become smaller and eventually it reaches a 002nish point when the number of pixels each processor needs to handle is equal and the pixels on all the processors constitute a complete image This method removes the constraint on the number of processors but each participating processor may incur more communications with others and some processors may be left idle in the process In addition they also proposed and analyzed several intuitive methods such as Reduced Binary Swap to extend the application scope of Binary Swap More recently Peterka 000 proposed the Parallel Pipeline method where all the processors are arranged in a 2-D grid and the entire composition procedure is divided into two sub-stages accordingly 9  A t e a c h s u b s t a g e  e a c h p r o c e s s o r j o i n s a group of processors sharing one common coordinator in the established 2-D grid coordinate system and communicates with others in the current group to blend its own pixels Different from Binary Swap this method removes the powerof-2 constraint on the number of processors However it introduces more communication cost than Binary Swap when the number of available processors happens to be a power of 2 Eilemann over P W proposed the classical Direct Send method which can be viewed as a simpli\002ed version of the Parallel Pipeline method in 1-D 5  Lin et al proposed the Rotate Tiling RT method which integrates the Binary Swap method with the Parallel Pipeline method 11  B y c a r e f u l l y d i v i d i n g t h e r e n d e r e d i m a g e o f each processor into a certain number of blocks Rotate Tiling reduces the communication overhead incurred in the entire procedure at the cost of unbalanced workload which may negatively affect the overall visualization performance Yu  W N divides the entire procedure into several substages according to the number of available processors 12  At each sub-stage each processor is paired with its counterpart according to its own processor label and the current sub-stage number This method evenly distributes the composition workload among all the participating processors and minimizes the number of sub-stages The main issue associated with this method is its constraint on the number of processors being a power of 2 Lee     W 0 1 1 without any blank pixels and needs to blend its own pixels with those corresponding et al et al et al proposed the Radix-k method in which the number of processors can be factorized arbitrarily 17  O n c e a c e r t a i n f a c t o r i z a t i o n i s s e l e c t e d  t h e composition procedure is scheduled according to the number of factors and the value of each factor involved in the factorization This method does not impose any constraint on the number of processors and has potential to achieve a good performance in terms of communication cost with a carefully selected factorization However since this method is intended for order-dependent problems it raises an issue on how a proper factorization should be selected in the case of a dynamic image arriving order In general an exhaustive search of all possible factorizations might be needed for the best performance The proposed Grouping More and Pairing Less GMPL method provides a generalization framework that encompasses several existing algorithms GMPL takes a prime factorizationbased approach to strategically divide the processors into a set of groups at the 002nest possible grain and form a wellstructured grid to minimize the communication overhead with evenly distributed workload When the number of processors is a prime or a power of 2 GMPL reduces to an improved version of the Direct Send algorithm applied to all the processors or in each established group The rest of the paper is organized as follows In Section III we describe the problem of image composition and present the details of our proposed algorithm with a theoretical justi\002cation on its validity In Sections IV and V we analyze and compare our algorithm with existing ones through theoretical analysis and real-life experiments respectively III T ECHNICAL A

generally incurs a high latency more ef\002cient methods are needed to improve its latency performance By integrating the above two aspects into algorithm design we propose a Grouping More and Pairing Less GMPL method for order-independent image composition whose pseudocode is provided in Algorithm 1 which calls PrimeFactorEncoding in Algorithm 2 andImprovedDS in Algorithm 3 The PrimeFactorEncoding function is used to calculate the code series of a given processor ID which comprises of a sequence of coordinates in the hyperspace of the prime factors derived from the number of processors Note

S 10 T 20 HyperX topology Results obtained from packet level simulations for MPTCP and ow level simulations for Dahu MPTCP-1Der achieves with 64 or 128 subows and can also handle short ows with efcient hash rebalancing At the transport layer MPTCP has no way of distinguishing between shortest and non-shortest paths and can leverage Dahu for better route selection These results indicate that Dahu effectively enables MPTCP to leverage non-shortest paths and achieve much better network utilization in direct networks with fewer subows 7 DISCUSSION As seen in Section 6 Dahu exploits non-minimal routing to derive large benets over ECMP for different topologies and varying communication patterns Yet there is a scenario where nonminimal routing can be detrimental This occurs when the network as a whole is highly saturated shortest path forwarding itself does well as most links have sufcient trafc and there is no unused capacity or slack in the network With Dahu a derouted ow consumes bandwidth on more links than if it had used just shortest paths thereby contributing to congestion on more links In large data centers this network saturation scenario is uncommon Networks have much lower average utilizations although there may be hot-spots or small cliques of racks with lot of communication between them Usually there is network slack or unused capacity which Dahu can leverage The network saturation case can be dealt with in many ways For example a centralized monitoring infrastructure can periodically check if a large fraction of the network is in its saturation regime and notify switches to stop using nonminimal paths Alternatively a simple renement to the localized load balancing scheme can be used which relies on congestion feedback from neighboring switches to fall back to shortest path forwarding in such high load scenarios Network packets are modied to store 1 bit in the IP header which is updated by each switch along the path of a packet to indicate whether the switch used a shortest path egress port or derouted the packet A switch receiving a packet checks if two conditions are satised 1 It doesnt have enough capacity to the destination along shortest paths alone and 2 The previous hop derouted the packet If both conditions are satised it sends congestion feedback to the previous hop notifying it to stop sending derouted trafc through this path for the particular destination prex for a certain duration of time say 5ms This solution is discussed further in 8 RELATED WORK There have been many recent proposals for scale-out multipath data center topologies such as Clos networks 2 16 direct networks like HyperX Flattened Buttery 20 DragonFly 21 and even randomly connected topologies proposed in Jellysh Many current proposals use ECMP-based techniques which are inadequate to utilize all paths or to dynamically load balance trafc Routing proposals for these networks are limited to shortest path routing or K-shortest path routing with Jellysh and end up underutilizing the network more so in the presence of failures While DAL routing allo ws deroutes it is limited to HyperX topologies In contrast Dahu proposes a topology-independent deployable solution for non-minimal routing that eliminates routing loops routes around failures and achieves high network utilization Hedera and MicroTE 7 propose a centralized controller to schedule long lived ows on globally optimal paths However they operate on longer time scales and scaling them to large networks with many ows is challenging While DevoFlow impro v e s the scalability through switch hardware changes it does not support non-minimal routing or dynamic hashing Dahu can co-exist with such techniques to better handle congestion at ner time scales MPTCP proposes a host based approach for multipath load balancing by splitting a ow into multiple subows and modulating how much data is sent over different subows based on congestion However as a transport protocol it does not have control over the network paths taken by subows Dahu exposes the path diversity to MPTCP and enables MPTCP to efciently utilize the non-shortest paths in a direct connect network There have also been proposals that employ variants of switch-local per-packet trafc splitting 13 W ith Dahu instead of per pack et splitting we locally rebalance ow aggregates across different paths thereby largely reducing in-network packet reordering Trafc engineering has been well studied in the context of wide area networks TeXCP MA TE 14 and REPLEX 15 split ows on different paths based on load however their long control loops make them inapplicable in the data center context which requires faster response times to deal with short ows and dynamic trafc changes FLARE e xploits the inherent b urstiness in TCP ows to schedule owlets bursts of packets on different paths to reduce extensive packet reordering Finally a key distinction between Dahu and the related trafc engineering approaches is that Dahu actively routes over nonshortest paths in order to satisfy trafc demand Dahu decouples non-minimal routing and its mechanism for more balanced hashing and offers a more exible architecture for better network utilization in direct connect networks 9 CONCLUSION Existing solutions for leveraging multipaths in the data center rely on ECMP which is insufcient due to its static nature and inability to extend beyond shortest path routing We present a new switch mechanism Dahu that enables dynamic hashing of trafc onto different network paths Dahu exploits non-shortest path forwarding to reduce congestion while preventing persistent forwarding loops using novel switch hardware primitives and control software We present a decentralized load balancing heuristic that makes quick local decisions to mitigate congestion and show the feasibility of proposed switch hardware modications We evaluate Dahu using a simulator for different topologies and different trafc patterns and show that it signicantly outperforms shortest path routing and complements MPTCP performance by selecting good paths for hashing subows 69
