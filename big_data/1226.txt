the queries before proceeding with the next retrieval round The rapid emergence of digital cameras and the Internet In practice inexperienced users may be hesitant or has lead to huge collections of photographic images The unwilling to provide feedback by setting the relevance efficient access to the individual images in such collections weights of individual images Consequently unsatisfactory is yet an unsolved challenge Traditional image retrieval was images are returned to the users Another limitation is that text-based Images were manually annotated with keywords the users retrieval and system interaction 
history is and the users searched for their images purely based on discarded as only the current query session is considered textual descriptions However automatically generating How can we provide a flexible query mechanism that help descriptive texts for a wide area of applicable images is not users search for their desired images Furthermore how to feasible Manual image annotation is expensive timecapture the retrieval behavior of users To achieve this goal consuming and often subjective and ambiguous The a relevance feedback strategy that employs data mining is problem 
is due to vague linguistic descriptions of images proposed Even a lengthy textual description is sometimes inadequate This paper is organized as follows Section 2 describes for expressing the rich contents of an image Moreover one the image features extraction and object representation used image can be expressed using different texts by different in the proposed scheme The theoretical image retrieval users or even the same user The content-based image system based on the proposed GM\(1,N model is retrieval CBIR technique pioneered in the early nineties investigated in section

224 A pixel constitutes noise if it exists in an area with a size smaller than a given threshold Such noise reduces the image retrieval performance and is therefore filtered Next the skeleton of the object in an image can be sketched by applying edge detection and edge tracing Edges are detected by measuring gray-level discontinuities in the image Hence a an edge is defined as a set of connected pixels with derivative values larger than a preset threshold The presence of an edge at a point in an image can be detected by the firstorder derivative The least-mean-squared method is used to perform the gradient analysis The gradient vector for an c d image f x y at location x y can be derived as follows Figure 1 The feature extraction for objects in a color image a the original image b the binarization image c the object 15 skeleton with noises d the object skeleton with noise deletion rafl 0 f  1 B Shape Descriptor and Normalization Gv Laf A good shape representation scheme captures object LY characteristics such that high recognition rates can be The gradient vector describes the maximum rate of achieved for shape-based image retrieval systems The change in the direction of image f at location x y  skeleton of an object is characterized by a distance sequence Therefore the magnitude of this vector is a very important expressed in polar coordinates First the centroid of the quantity in edge detection This quantity gives the maximum object must be located The geometric center of the object is rate of increase of f x,y per unit distance in the direction chosen as the polar central point of an object as follows of Vf  In general the gradient vector is denoted as Vf  1 Nb 1 Nb where X  N Ext I YC 1 3 Vf  mag\(Vf   G  Gj 2 2 where xC Y is the polar center point of the object Nb is the number of pixels in the edge and xi yi is the The computation of partial derivatives af  ax and coordinate location of a pixel in the edge of the object af ay is time consuming In practice we can approximate Then by calculating the distance di from the polar the gradient with its absolute summation of Vf  G+Gy center point to each successive point along the edge in Here we take the Prewitt operators of size 3 x 3 to approach counterclockwise direction through a fixed angle 0  the the derivates shape is represented by the Euclidean distance sequence Edge detection involves finding the edge points and xi  do  d I dn_1 To achieve object scaling invariance edge tracing involves tracing the edge pixels usually by the distance sequences are normalized with respect to the collecting the edge pixels into an edge list The image is maximum distance in each distance sequence As a result scanned from left to right and from top to bottom to find the the values of the normalized distance sequences fall between first edge point of an object Then its 8-adjacency points are 0 and 1 checked to find the second edge point Due to the closure property of an object the first edge point will also be the end C Matching with Changing Start Point edge point Therefore the stop condition is whenever a By default the distance sequence representation is not point's coordinate coincides with the coordinate of the first invariant to rotation as two identical shapes rotated at edge point As a result the skeleton of an object can be different angles will have different distance sequences For sketched The process is shown in Fig 1 example the two distance sequences 0.231,0.415,0.316 0.287 and 0.316 0.287,0.231,0.415 represents the same shape These sequences will be equivalent if the first sequence is circularly shifted two positions leftwards The mountain climbing sequence MCS algorithm is introduced to obviate this problem 16 The ordering-consistency ci of a sequence 0  d,d1  d1  is first calculated as follows j+\(n-l c  n-\(kj 4 where i 1,2,...,n and le 1,n The index s with the smallest value is determined as follows 1 4244-0363-4/06/$20.OO 2512006 IEEE

Related work and conclusion Mining sequential patterns has been extensively studied in data mining community since the first research work in [1]. The earlier studies which focused on the large size of retail datasets have developed several Apriorilike algorithms in order to solve the problem of discovering sequential patterns from such databases However, the Apriori-like algorithms only perform well in databases consisting of short frequent sequences [17 This is caused by the fact that it is quite time-consuming to generate nTerms sequences candidates from \(n1 disadvantage of Apriori-like algorithms [1], a variety of algorithms such as PrefixSpan [17], SPADE [25 SLPMiner [22] and GST [12] have been proposed. In order to improve the efficiency, each algorithm pursues a different method of discovering frequent sequential patterns, which makes them featured by the capability of mining such patterns without even generating any candidates With respect to the representation of the content of documents, some research works have used phrases rather than individual words [21]. However, the effectiveness of the text mining systems was not improved very much. The likely reason is that, a phrasebased method has  lower consistency of assignment and lower document frequency for terms  21]. Hence, in this paper, we present a novel concept for mining text documents for sequential patterns. Instead of using single words, we use pattern-based taxonomy to represent documents. By pruning meaningless patterns which have been proven to be the source of the  noise   in this study, the problem of  overfitting  is solved and the experimental results which show the encouraging outcomes are achieved 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Recall Pr e c is

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
