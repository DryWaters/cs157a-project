ficiently solve the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping problem for indoor environments, and to reconstruct a 3D representation of the environment. The accompanying video illustrates the incremental generation of a 2D map and the estimation of the robot trajectory alongside the laser range data projected on omnidirectional images. It also shows the vertical lines detected in the images and their mapping into a 3D reconstruction of the environment In order to show the robustness of the methodology, we tested the algorithm with a sequence taken in a different indoor environment with our old robot Anis which is equipped with the same catadioptric camera and an AccuRange 4000 2D laser range finder. This laser is composed of a laser telemeter with a rotating mirror that allows measurements of points on 360?, except for an occlusion cone of approximately 30? caused by the assembly of the mirror. The resulting 2D map is shown in Figure 9. The vertical line extraction and the reconstruction of the 3D environment were 3523 Fig. 9. Global Map obtained by SLAM in Borel Building consistent as well The SLAM problem has been solved using many different approaches, however some important problems need to be addressed that are often directly linked to the sensors used Laser range finders cannot help in evaluating the translation of a robot moving in a straight line in a corridor. Mapping in dynamic environments is also hard with only laser data. On the other hand, using visual sensors alone introduces issues such as propagating correctly the scale factor, initializing the range when using a monocular sensor, and merging data when using multiples cameras In our approach, the laser provides metric information of the environment that helps to fix a scale factor \(removing the difficulty of propagating the scale factor need to use multiple cameras. Throughout the paper we have identified several advantages of combining laser and visual sensors. Our experimental results are encouraging and give us valuable insight into the possibilities offered by this composite sensor approach We have considered several research directions that could be pursued to improve the results obtained so far. We have thought about extending our algorithm with loop closure de 


tection. This would allow the algorithm to detect previously visited locations and improve the accuracy of mapping and the precision in the estimation of the robot pose. Being able to detect previously visited places is of great importance to solve the problem of global localization and to recover the robot from kidnapping, a situation occurring when the robot is displaced by something out of its control \(e.g. taking an elevator, being transported from one location to another Therefore, solving the loop closure problem will not only improve SLAM performance, but will as well enable new capabilities Further work will concentrate on an extension of the PSM algorithm to exploit the information about vertical lines detected using omnidirectional images. Segmentation of the ground \(floor a dense \(textured onto the geometric model of the world. Finally, we believe the general approach can be extended to solve the full six degrees of freedom \(6DOF active field of research REFERENCES 1] L.Charbonnier and O.Strauss, A suitable polygonal approximation for laser range finder data, Proceedings of the Intelligent Vehicles 95 Symposium, Detroit, Mi, 1995, pp 118-123 2] J.Nieto, T.Bailey and E.Nebot, Recursive scan-matching SLAM Robotics and Autonomous Systems, vol. 55, 2007, pp 39-49 3] J.S.

As can be seen, in general, TOP-MATA shows a better performance than TOP-DATA. And as the increase of the ? value, the advantage tends to be even more impressive for these four data sets 4.3. The Computation Saving of TOP-MATA As can be seen in the Tab. 4, four data sets, enjoy signi?cant computation savings brought by TOP-MATA. We can conclude that the computation saving is a major factor for the performance of TOP-MATA. That is, compared with TOP-DATA, a higher computation saving implies a much better performance of TOP-MATA. Since this saving is more signi?cant as the increase of the items, TOP-MATA works better for large scale data sets with a large number of items 5. Conclusion In this paper, we studied the problem of searching for top? item pairs with the highest cosine values among all item pairs. Speci?cally, we provided a novel algorithm TOPMATA which employ a Max-First traversal strategy for ef?ciently performing top-? cosine similarity search. Extensive experimental results veri?ed the effectiveness of the algorithms, And TOP-MATA algorithm is superior to TOPDATA for large-scale data sets with multiple items Acknowledgment This research was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China \(NSFC No. 70901002 and the Ph.D. Programs Foundation of Ministry of Education of China \(No. 20091102120014
