radar using a Particle filter as a nonlinear predictor for data fusion and prediction. The algorithm is based on using Particle filter instead of using a linear or non-linear Kalman Filter Extended Kalman Filter\. Particle filtering, also known as Sequential Monte Carlo, is an attractive estimation procedure for non-linear dynamical systems. Recently several popular methods such as Forward Backward Smoother \(FBS\, and Maximum A-Posteriori Smoother \(MAP\ave been introduced into the literature. These techniques involve a re-computation of the discrete distribution obtained from the Particle filter While the smoother offers an improvement in the estimation there is a significant computation cost that often makes this step unattractive in practice. The system is simulated using 
Matlab to compare the performance of the estimation routines of both the Kalman and Particle filters, and Particle filter without and with smoothers. The processing time is also studied. Simulation results shows that the Kalman filter improves the automatic tracking performance with multiple observations. Particle filter improves the fusion and prediction estimate of the non-linear moving object in presence of measurement errors  T ABLE OF C ONTENTS  1  I NTRODUCTION 1 2  T HEORITICAL D ESCRIPTION 1 3  T HE S IMULATION

This pre-detection step produces detection at a constant false alarm rate and further signal processing is performed to achieve a synthesized signal 
Though there are several methods for target tracking described in literature [1-5 e Kal m an  f ilteri n g ex te n d ed  Kalman filtering, Bayesian approach, IMM-PDA, ML-PDA particle filters, random set theory, covariance intersection neuro-fuzzy methods, tracking through genetic algorithms and so on, the goal has always been to adaptively tackle the changing situations. Since, no one sensor can perform well in all the conditions, multi-sensor adaptive processing has been the inherent focus. This paper confines our attention to investigating the performance of the Particle filter when combining estimates from multistatic radar systems. The approach, involves the use of a Particle filter to correct track errors. This filter improves the fusion and prediction estimate of the non-linear moving object in presence of 
measurement errors  2  T HEORETICAL D ESCRIPTION  Now we consider nonlinear relationships between the state and observed variables to add more flexibility to the time series framework. A general description of such a stochastic state-space model would have the following form       1    2 where f and g can either be linear or nonlinear functions Assume a system of the form given in Equations \(1\ and \(2 
This system can be used to generate a sequence of observations. Our goal is to obtain an estimate of x t given only the observations y t and the probability models that govern the data generating processes. An estimation of the discrete distribution, p\(x t y 1:t be obtained from a simulated system of particles. First, we assume an initial set of n particles   coming from some initial distribution p\(x1\he predicted state for particle I at the next time t = 1 is computed as follows      
3 This iterative procedure is done for all particles I up to time T. The next step is to compute a weight for these predicted samples by applying Bayes theorem, which shows how to determine inverse probabilities: if the conditional probability  of A given B, what is the conditional probability  of B given A?. These weights can be thought of as corrections to the predictions. Prediction particles that have a large error in predicting y t are given smaller weights probabilities\d particles with small estimation errors are given larger weights. The filtering procedure is a two steps iterative process that can be stated more generally as follows  


  2 Prediction Step : Assume we are given samples [6        Obtain the predicted samples at the next time    using the following equation for i=1,2\205N       4 Correction Step: Take samples from  and generate samples from the next posterior                      5 So the particle  is therefore a sample from the discrete distribution  according to the following probability             6 The forward-backward algorithm is an inference algorithm  for hidden Markov models  which computes the posterior  marginals  of all hidden state variables given a sequence of observations/emissions y1:t, i.e. it computes for all hidden state variables x1:t, the distribution   This inference task is usually called smoothing The algorithm makes use of the principle of dynamic programming  to efficiently compute the values that are required to obtain the posterior marginal distributions in two passes. The first pass goes forward in time while the second goes backward in time; hence the name Forward-Backward Algorithm. Maximum A Posteriori probability \(MAP estimate is a mode  of the posterior distribution [7   T h e MAP can be used to obtain a point estimate  of an unobserved quantity on the basis of empirical data. It is closely related to Fisher 's method of Maximum Likelihood ML\, but employs an augmented optimization objective which incorporates a prior distribution  over the quantity one wants to estimate. MAP estimation can therefore be seen as a regularization  of ML estimation   Figure 1 - Multistatic Radar Particle Filter  3  T HE S IMULATION P ROCESS  The paper considers a nonlinear system of the following form     7   8 Then      9     10 For this illustration, we assume that the parameters 002 a, b  n o w n q u an t i t i e s  1012]. We w a nt t o obt ai n estimates of the state process X given observations from the data vector Y. To compare the performance of the estimation routines of both the filters and smoothers, we apply these procedures on a simple nonlinear model where 002  6, .2, .2, .2 u atio n s 9  an d 1 0  a r e u s ed to si m u late  T = 80 observations under 002 to obtain X and Y from the state and measurement systems. These simulated values for X and Y represent the latent values of the process and the observed data of this process, respectively. Treating the data Y and 002 as known, we apply both the filters and smoothers using n = 100 particles to re-estimate X. We then test how well each estimation procedure fits the initial simulated unobserved time-series X 4  S IMULATION R ESULS  The generated non-linear data is processed using four different kinds of Kalman filter [13-15 c o m p ared to a  Particle filter. Figure 1 show a simulated state variable X against several estimates. The first estimate, represent estimate obtained from Centralized Fused \(CEF\alman filter, against the Particle filter estimate in the presence of the noisy observations. The same comparisons for Decentralized Fused \(DCEF\r Covariance \(EC\, IMM Kalman filter are demonstrated in Figures 2 to 4 respectively. For all comparisons it is clear that the particle filter has superiority over Linear Kalman Filter or Extended Kalman filter for tracking the combined observation from multistatic radar receivers. Table 1 illustrates the processing time for each filter and it is clear that Particle filter has shortest time than extended Kalman filter techniques. FBS and MAP smoothers are applied to the Particle filter to improve its operation, the results in Figures 6 - 7 and show that these smoothers improve the performance of the filter but pay much time for processing than the filter so it is not suitable for fast real time applications. Figure 8 shows the Root Mean Square Error \(RMSE\or the particle filter at 10 20, and 50 particles
