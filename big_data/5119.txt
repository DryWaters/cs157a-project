The 7 th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Data Acquisition and Advanced Computing Systems Technology and Applications 12-14 September 2013 Berlin Germany Strong Passwords Practical Issues Keisuke Kato Vitaly Klyuev Department of Computer Science and Engineering University of Aizu Fukushima Japan  s1190085,vkluev  u-aizu.ac.jp URL http://www.u-aizu.ac.jp  vkluev Abstract  Nowadays there are a lot of news about hacking attacks over the Internet against companies and government organization Web sites in the world Victims 
are big companies such as Evernote Facebook Google and others Web server providers understand that the current authentication systems and passwords should be strong The end users who are not specialists in the security should understand how to select strong passwords Now however there is no ideal way to set a strong password Most of the users donêt know important elements for password protection In this paper we analyze the tendencies in the password protection We survey 262 students of the University of Aizu A questionnaire consists of 15 questions about length of a password strategy to create a new password and etc We discuss useful techniques to create 
strong passwords and compare them Our analysis is based on our data and the state of the art literature review Our results can be helpful for the users to create a new password and/or change it and make it strong KeywordsÑSecurity Password Hacking Survey Tendency Authentication I I NTRODUCTION Password authentication is one of important services on the Internet personal computers and so on We always use password authentication to be logged into Web applications remote systems and etc Now password authentication is an essential service in our life for protecting our data On the other hand this service is also very 
dangerous cause of hacking attacks If the user set a password that is easy to hack or guess the user may loose money sensitive data etc Thus many companies and/or governmental organizations consider this service as 2-step password authentication for protecting the data For example Google has developed 2-step veriìcation system in 2011 and all user accounts of Google can use 2step password veriìcation for protecting their data from hackers This service should be very strong however itês not a complete system yet Passwords are of course not the only the means to authenticate end users to systems Book discusses three key options for authentication The rst one it is to 
retain physical control on the device such as a remote car door key The second one is a password The third option is to use something like a ngerprint or iris pattern Also recently Hardware Authentication is one of them But for the cost reason most systems take passwords Thus we have to know more details about passwords To obtain a good knowledge of password authentication there are a lot of sources To understand password security better we consider the problem from three different angles  Will the user remember the password  Will the user choose a password thatês hard to hack 
or guess  Will the user reuse the password on other systems and/or applications In this paper we seek to better understanding of the tendencies that make creating and/or changing passwords We discuss key security problems tendencies in password protection techniques misunderstanding points for the users etc We present the results of a survey of 262 University of Aizu undergraduate students The results of our investigations are important for end users to help in setting the strong passwords This paper is organized as follows In Section II we discuss basic issues to encrypt a password hacking approaches protecting measures and some tools to hack 
passwords In section III we discuss the tendencies in password protection show the results of our questionnaire and compare them with other data In Section IV we show some japanese data collected by the Informationtechnology Promotion Agency Japan and compare them with our data In Section V we discuss practical recommendations to set strong passwords In Section VI we highlight our signiìcant ndings II P ASSWORD H ACKING The standard way to present the passwords on the remote server or on the local computer is to encrypt them Because keeping a plaintext le with passwords is very dangerous passwords are often protected by encrypting 
them using one-way algorithms Encryption algorithms use hash functions In this section we analyze ways to construct hash functions and discuss the approaches to hack or guess passwords A One-Way Encryption When we try to access a Web application on-line system etc the password is passed through a one-way function and the user is logged into only if it matches a value of the stored one already However actually we use a more precisely techniques Thus the right way to do it is to 978-1-4799-1429-6/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 608 


1 generate random numbers by a pseudo-random generator that is called salt 2 pass through a one-way function with the password and the salt 3 If it matches a value store the salt and the hash value in the le When the user logged in next time the stored values are used for checking a password One-way functions are one of classical type of ciphers and also known as Cryptographic hash functions  They are used to compute checksums on les you can compute hash values of the les to identify which les are already known and which are new ones Also hash values are used as means of checking the integrity of les as they are changed if les are corrupted An example of this usage is the digital signature Signature algorithms tend to be slow if the message is very long so itês usually convenient to sign a message digest rather than the message itself There are three properties related to on one-way functions The rst property is one-way  Given an input x we can easily compute the hash value h\(x  however it is very difìcult to nd the input x  if the hash value h\(x is known See Figure 1 On the other hand a pseudorandom function will also have this property or will be used to distinguish from a random function The second property is that output will not give any information about any part of the input Thus a oneway encryption of the value x can be accomplished by concatenating it with a secret key k and computing h\(x,k  If the the number of possible salt values is not enough to utilize it then the one-way encryption will produce a lot of collisions in calculation of the hash values The third property is that itês difìcult to nd collisions when the two different messages M 1   M 2 will result with h M 1   h M 2   If the hash function output is an n bit number the number of hashes the enemy will need to compute before he can expect to nd A match will be about 2 n 2 hashes This issue is very important in security engineering For the one-way function it is crucial to have these properties If it defects just only one thing the function can be hacked easily by hackers and the user will loose a lot of data For example MD5 is one of the popular hash functions however it was broken in 2004 5 collisions can now be found easily even between strings containing meaningful information B Hacking Approaches For a hacker the rst step to hack a password is to encrypt the possible password candidates and to compare the result values with the values of encrypted real password Actually there may be some weak points in some functions or hackers can nd the weak points faster than specialists in security can do that and hackers may attack these weak points utilizing a lot of ways The one of the common way to break the passwords is to scan the whole Figure 1 Parts of one-way functionês properties space of the character set used in passwords for a brute force attack The one way functions or algorithms like MD5 SHA etc are very fast to run For hackers however this is very important because they can use a brute force attack easily Base on this a time-effective approach is to think about the candidates that are to be the actual words patterns or combination of the characters which are not difìcult to remember Another common way used in practice is dictionary attacks  In the past some system that use an encrypted password le made readable A user who can fetch this le then try to break passwords ofîine using a dictionary Thus he encrypts the values in his dictionary and compares them with those in the le This activity is called dictionary attacks  Actually most modern operating system have xed this problem However the dictionary attacks are still implemented Study discuss f ast dictionary attack algorithms by using time-space tradeoff and actually their algorithm recovered 67.6 of the passwords using a 2  10 9 search space C Hacking Tools There are several hacking tools available to hack or guess passwords The target of hacking tools is two object passwords and the function for administrators to reactively check the passwords used in the system The reactive checking may increase the system security by nding the easy to hack passwords and by warning the related uses to change their passwords to prevent their accounts from being cracked by intruders John the Ripper and Hashcat  9 are the tools to do the analysis and provide information on methods used by hackers III T ENDENCIES IN THE PASSWORD PROTECTION We do hope a lot of end users can set strong passwords in the future However now the Internet community is facing many problems One of them is in many misunderstandings in the security problems In this section we focus on this problem We discuss which information is true or not 609 


A survey on password protection issues was conducted in April 2013 at the University of Aizu The participations are 163 second year undergraduate students and 99 third year undergraduate students majoring in Computer Science A questionnaire in paper-based format was distributed among 262 students It consists of 15 questions A goal of this survey was to get the information on password usage by unprofessional security users We summarize the results of discussions by using survey data and data from others sources 10]Ö[13 A Difìculties with a password structure Our results shows that 8 22 of students said that their password is strong and 80 211 of students said that it is not strong It means that they donêt have a good strategy to set strong passwords Another interesting outcome is 40 105 of students use the same password for different accounts such as Google account Facebook account etc The mean of accounts that is used for the same password is 5.4 accounts Study sho ws that about 30 of users used the same password four or more times Thus we need a strategy to set a strong password for each end user So we tried to understand a strategy to set new password from the data of our survey but we could not nd it We prepared following selections for this question  Password based on the rst letter of each word in a phrase  Based on the name of someone or something  Based on a word or name with numbers  symbols added to beginning or end  Based on a word or name with numbers and symbols substituting for some of the letters  Based on a word in a language other than English  Based on a phone number  Based on an address  Based on a birthday  Abbreviation consisting of the rst characters of the phrase/sentence  Others However 36 96 students selected Others and 16 students selected I prefer not to answer The length of the passwords is very important issue in the password protection From our observation we found that many users have one big misunderstanding related to passwords It is about long passwords Actually many users believe that long passwords are equal to strong passwords but this is not true Why the long password is not equal to the strong password All users must memorize the long passwords However it is very difìcult for them to memorize the string like this qVwN2s6K@Ka  Thus they create the long password that is very easy to memorize and then many users use grammatical structure such as Ihave3cats for the passwords This passw ord may be long b u t applying the dictionary attack  it can be easily guessed As a Password Length Frequency  0 5 10 15 20 25 0 20406080100 Figure 2 Tendency of password length result the possibility to hack or guess increases from 6 to 20.5 W e carefully analyzed resulting sheets Figure 2 shows the distribution of the password length The mean of password length is 9.1 characters Figure 3 and Table I shows the difference of distribution between third year and second year students For 2nd year students the standard deviation is 2.4 but for third year students the standard deviation is 3.0 It means third year students have more variations in password length compared to second year students Table I D IFFERENCE OF S TANDARD DEVIATION BETWEEN 2 ND YEAR AND 3 RD YEAR STUDENTS  Question Summary  2 ndyear   3 rdyear  Password Length 2.409025 3.071228 How many lowercase letters 2.832335 3.421342 How many uppercase letters 1.646054 2.66999 How many numerical letters 1.667903 3.61654 Study sho ws the relationship between the passw ord length and strength of passwords The portion of the strong passwords with the length of 7 characters has a proportion of 96  among the whole passwords Such a high percentage is not observed for the passwords with the length less than 7 According to these results number 7 is the critical threshold value of the password length and the passwords including less than 7 characters may be seen as weak Another data related to the character lengths of the passwords is that the password with the exact length of 8 characters have a rate of 45  among the all passwords This last observation implies that the users have a high tendency on choosing passwords with 8-character long Study suggests to use P art-of-Speech tagging that is such as Determiner Adjective Adjective Noun to hack and utilize common hacking tools characterized in Section II 610

known way for setting passwords and this is easy for the end user to memorize However hackers also know this way for setting it and actually they work on how to break So variant c is not weak but not very strong Variant b is actually strong password However for memorizing the passwords variant b is NOT good for end users From this survey we analyzed the end users can distinguish which password is strong On the other hand they donêt have good strategies to set a strong password by themselves Actually in second year students 9 students selected variant a  71 students selected variant b  and 10 students selected variant c  And in third year students 11 students selected variant a  65 students selected variant b  18 students selected variant c  Thus an understanding the strong password is the same level between second and third year students Now it is time to summarize the users misunderstandings Studies 16]Ö[18 and results of our in v estigations are good sources for such explanation  The long password is NOT always equal to the strong password when you set the passwords you should set passwords such as long without language grammatical structure easy to memorize etc  A password consisting only of numerical characters or only alphabetical characters such as only uppercase or only lower-case is very dangerous It will be easily hacked or guessed The users should use numerical and alphabetical characters to set passwords 19  We strongly recommend the users for memorizing passwords to use a password management tools such as Last Path 1Password KeePass Password Dragon  etc  Users should avoid to use such as password  abc123 and personal data such as name birthday address telephone number etc directly Itês well known news that a lot of users set such passwords and hackers have already known it  A password that usable as abbreviation from a phrase of sentence is good for end users to memorize the password  The user should NOT tell any person their passwords and should NOT share it with any person VI C ONCLUSION In this paper we focused on the practical issues related to setting a strong password in the real world We discussed security issues related to password protection tendencies misunderstandings in the password protection difìculties to memorize the passwords strategies and algorithms Our analysis is from survey of 262 University of Aizu students and obtained results are compared with data from different sources We analyzed key problems for setting a strong password for Web applications remote systems etc Now however many companies convert the password authentication to 2-step password authentication This is the best way to authenticate users However we are thinking that for utilizing 2-step password authentication more effectively we must know more details about password authentication for protection our or companyês sensitive data The recommendations discussed in this paper also can help set the strong passwords It means that if password authentication is converted to 2-step authentication we can set a more strong password system R EFERENCES  Google 2-step v eriìcation  http://www google.com/landing 2step  R Anderson Security

Secretary Rice does not share any unique keywords with either Secret ary Albright or Secretary Clinton; however Secretary Albright and Secretary Clinton share the keyword together There seems to be more similarities between the Secretaries and the phrases they use. All three Secretaries share and as important keywords Secretary Albright and Secretary Rice share while Albright and Secretary Clinton share Secretaries Rice and Clinton also share and as well   the and have been common foreign policy goals since at least 1997 This shows us that although administrations may change, and even political parties, there are some consistent themes in foreign policy. We can say that the and are the main important region and state th at the United States is consistently concerned with, however the showing up as a common phrase between Secretary Rice and Clinton shows that this is an up and coming important region as well. This also tells us that a large portion of the United States foreign policy is concerned with Since this phrase has been consistent for almost 12 years, it can be said this is an important message from the United States. Another finding is the consistency of

across all Secretaries. This is particularly interesting in Secretary Riceês case since her previous statements include conducting foreign policy based on the national interest, and not the international community Some of the more interesting findings come from what is unique about each Secretaries important keywords and phrases. For instance, Secretary Albright has and as two of her most important phrases however these words are not found in Secretary Riceês important phrases. This could be a conscious effort by Secretary Rice to not use after it was found that Iraq never had them. There is also a commonality between Secretary Albright and Secretary Rice in that they share in their important phrases. This supports the fact that the Iraqi nation and its former leader was a key point in foreign policy from as early as 1997 up until 2005, a span of at least eight years Secretary Rice also has some of the most politically charged keywords and phrases, more so than Secretaries Albright and C linton. Three of Secretary Riceês keywords are Democracy, Political, and Democratic. This could show that she felt a very politically motivated purpose to foreign policy Another unique finding from the Rice dataset is that the Soviet Union is one of the important phrases for Secretary Rice. Since the S oviet Union collapsed in 1990, it is interesting this phrase comes up most frequently, and within a high percentage of her speeches. Further keyword in context analysis should lead to more explanations for the appearance of this phrase so frequently is another unique keyword for Secretary Rice as well, denoting an open mind towards dialogue and communication within her foreign policy messages Secretary Clinton separates herself from the previous female Secretaries of State as well. She is the only Secretary with keywords of and denoting a difference in how she views her position from the others. Future is an interesting keyword; it could note that she sees foreign policy as being a l ong-term investment, or that the United States should be more forward looking in their foreign policy initiatives. Or she wants to convey to other nations that the US is thinking about the future, and not staying in the present. Progress is also interesting. It is a word that can carry a negative connotation for some people within the United States, such as conservatives However, again keeping in mind the Secretary of State is usually speaking to a foreign audience, she could be lauding foreign publics for their progress, or pushing foreign countries to make more progress democratically, or within the human rights realm Finally, she is the only Secretary to use Economic as well. This could be a product of our times, when most of the world is embroiled in economic recessions; it could also note the ever-increasing globalization of the worldês economic ties and its shared ups and downs. Secretary Clinton and Secretary Albright share the keyword with each other, while this is not part of Secretary Riceês keywords. This could be confirming Jeffreys-Jonesês statement that women tend to be more pacifists, but Rice would not fit within the mold since Peace was not within her keywords. It could have to do with ideological differences between Democrat and Republican administrations, or it could be due to the fact that Secretary Rice was trying to manage public opinion on the two ongoing wars in the Middle East Afghanistan and Iraq. Mentioning might be seen as hypocritical while being involved in two conflicts. Secretaries Albri ght and Clinton also share as a common phrase while Secretary Rice does not. This might be a conscious decision since many foreign populati ons saw the invasion of Iraq as unlawful, and Secret ary Rice did not want to court controversy Finally, Secretary Albrightês dataset had the least amount of speeches, but it still provides insight into her unique themes is the only keyword unique to Secretary Albright, wh ich could possibly denote a pension for speaking the tr uth, or only imparting what is fact-based and not opinion based on her part She does have unique phrases though, including and Although currently most people would pair Weapons of Mass Destruction with a Secretary of State from the Bush administration, it was Secr etary Albright who used the terminology most often Secretary Albrightês use of the phrase Chairman Arafat is also telling, it shows that the Palestinian conflict was given much higher priority during the late 1990ês then it has been today Palestine or any of its conjugations does not appear on either Secretary Clint onês or Secretary Riceês important keywords or phrases. This conflict has given way to Iraq and Afghanistan Also interesting from the findings is there are no keywords or phrases relati ng to women, girls, or womenês rights as a foreign policy initiative Although Secretary Albright discussed her wish to make a difference in the lives of women and girls across the developing world within her article in the SAIS Review, our findings are not consistent. None of the female secretaries had an important keyword or phrase relating to females leading us to believe that while women and girls might be an important

and emotional topic, it is not a top priority for US foreign policy  This paper has multiple limitations on its research. The datasets included are only for the three most recent female Secretar ies of State and cannot be used to generalize an overall US foreign policy message. Also, there is a gap between the three female Secretaries filled by Secretary of State Colin Powell. For purposes of this paper, and in order to keep gender consistent across all datasets, Secretary Powell was not included Another limitation is the lack of keyword in context analysis. Although these keywords and phrases are important due to their number of times used, as well as their appearance in a large percentage of cases, their context may differ. Further analysis of these important keywords and phrases will lead to deeper insights and more complex nuances  This study is an initial analysis on three separate datasets. Further contextual analysis can lead to deeper understandings of the frequently occurring keywords and phrases that are predominant from each Secretary. Keyword in context analysis will provide further unpacking a nd clearer definitions of what each keyword or phrase means when the Secretary uses it. A prior crosstabs analysis on the Secretary Clinton dataset provided further clues to the evolution of keywords and phrases over time and geography. This analysis will be completed on Secretary Rice and Secretary Albrightês datasets as well. Future analysis will include Secretary Powellês tenure from 2001-2005 in order to see if his themes are consistent with those before and after his term Future research will also include the final two approaches from the ASSANA Methodology traditional hand coding as well as the High Performance Computing Environment. Incorporating these other approaches will allow for a full review of the differences in findings and time for analysis between each approach
