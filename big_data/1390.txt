INTRODUCTION \nRecently android phone and iPhone have become a regular \npart of our lives [1]. Irrespective of age or sex, most people \nown a smartphone, and they use many kinds of application that \nare using sensor and device on it. With the development of \nthese telecommunication technologies and the pervading \napplications, personal data that is recorded automatically like \nbuying information and action history have exploded and been \ndispersed throughout the society. \nNow, the personal data consists of personal attribute data \nsuch as address, birth, title and so on and personal history data \nsuch as buying information action history, food history and so \non. \nPersonal data that we called big data recently is attractive \nfor not only the companies to use for marketing purposes and \nprovide a new personalized service but also the goverrnnent. \nFor instance, the Japanese government is offering a 5.3 billion \nyen subsidy in last year [2 And JIPDEC [3], which is a non­\nprofit organization established with the aim of enhancing the \ndevelopment of economy and community offers many services \nfor personal information protection and information security nHowever, it takes a long time to build these social systems, \nand individuals have difficulties to access these data, and they \ndo not have any means to benefit from their own records, even \nthough they generate them. \n978-1-908320-20/9/$25.00©2013 IEEE \nYuuki Matsuda and Tetsuro Ogi \nGraduate School of System Design and Management \nKeio University \nYokohama, Japan \nIn the present study, we aim to suggest framework for \nhandling personal data to give the power of personal data back \nto individuals. And also, at the same time, the company can \nalso use it freely and across the companies, if individual allow \nusing it. Currently, most companies hold only limited personal \ndata that is collected by each company. Therefore, we need a \nnew framework in which the benefits of both individuals and \ncompanies can be balanced. \nIn this paper, to aim for the realization of this framework, \nwe focus on buying information that is got automatically from \nhousehold account application using Point of Sales \(POS  nEspecially, to propose a self-control method of our own buying \ninformation, we discuss which is the most available way based \non the questionnaire survey. \nThe structure of this paper is as follows. The next section nshows the situation surrounding personal data. In section 3, two \nproblems that we recognize under this situation are shown and \nthe framework to solve it is suggested. In section 4, the paper \nshows the structure that is able to handle personal data easily \nby focusing on buying information. In section 5, we explain the ndetail of questionnaire survey on handling buying information \nto select without any resistance and to allow using it for getting \nmore rewards on this framework, and also the result of it. In \nsection 6, the paper shows the idea of new digital signage \nsystem based on personal data. \nII. MARKET TREND AND RELATED WORKS \nIn these days, not only company but also the government is \nengaging in a lively exchange of opinions regarding Handling \nabout Personal data"[5]. And also, there are many studies about \npersonal data. In this section, we introduce hot market trend \nand related works and discuss how different from our study. \nA. Midata in u.K. \nIn u.K., BIS \(Department for Business Innovation & \nSkills  is \nthe one of the Consumer Empowerment Strategy. This project \naim that, 1 businesses to release \npersonal data to consumers electronically, 2 data securely, 3 apps effective use of their data. Actually, many \n107 \nThe 8th International Conference for Internet Technology and Secured Transactions \(ICITST-2013 ex. Google, British Gas, L10yds TSB and 02 project. It is very similar to our framework, but \nthey focus on only how to access to it which "the company nhold". They are unmentioned to "could download their own \ndata" and "hold it by themselves". \nB. The World Economic Forum \nThey reported "Rethinking Personal Data: Strengthening \nTrust" in 2012[7]. They discussed how the potential value of \npersonal data could be unlocked. But they focus on only for the \nbenefit to companies 


and organizations. Of cause they are care \nabout individual's benefit but not first priority. \nC. Related works \nThere are many related works, which focus on personal \ndata. \nFor instance, there are some developed systems that are \nable to stock own personal data such as movies and pictures \nautomatically[8][9][1O]. It becomes much easier to collect \npersonal data automatically than before, and also we can enjoy \ncollecting it much more than before. \nAnd also, there are some systems that are able to manage \npersonal own data. PIMA enhanced both human-computer \ninteraction and application integration for PIM on mobile \ndevices[II]. It becomes more perceived usefulness, ease-of-use, \nand efficiency of PIM on mobile devices. Open PDS by MIT nallows individuals to collect, store, and give fme-grained \naccess to their own data all while protecting their privacy[12]. \nThey provide a secured space. Therefore, individual can \nmanage and control the flow of data much safer than before. \nWith these systems such as PIMA and open PDS, individuals \nare able to use or manage their own data much easier and safer \nthan before. \nThey become recognizing and discussing consumers rights \nto data ownership in personal data and how important \nindividual-oriented information privacy model[13][14]. \nHowever these works are discussing only how to collect such \nas which device use or how to manage. They do not refer to the \nneed to get reward and be balanced the benefits of both \nindividuals and companies. \nIn this paper, we aimed to suggest framework for handling \npersonal data to give the power of personal data back to \nindividuals with rewards on each investment. And also, at the \nsame time, the company can also use it freely and across the \ncompanies, if individual allow using it. We need a new \nframework that can be balanced the benefits of both individuals \nand companies. \nIII. PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS \nIn this section, we discuss about two problems that we are \nable to recognize under the situation of current personal data \nand suggest the framework to solve it. \n978-1-908320-20/9/$25.00©2013 IEEE \nA. Problems \nThere are two problems to solve, under this situation: \n• We don't figure all of our own personal data out, and \nalso there is no reasonable way to control it. \n• There is no reasonable way to give our personal data to \nthe companies under our control and also we are not \nable to receive a proper reward from companies. \nFor many years, the companies have used personal data as \ncustomer data to better understand consumer and use for \nmarketing without any permission from each individual. \nHowever, individuals have not only difficulties to access, but nalso do not have any means to benefit from their own records, \neven though they generate. In fact, according to previous \nresearch [4], many people are eager to know and handle these \npersonal data by themselves. \nOn the other hand, the companies can hold only limited \npersonal data that is collected by each company. In Japan, if \nthey can identify an individual, it's forbidden to share personal \ndata among companies by law However they want to know \nwhole data for marketing. Therefore, sometime they edit it to \navoid identifying an individual and then sell or buy it, although \nit is offensive to some individuals. In fact, we can see it on the \nheadline news throughout Japan. \nTherefore, we aim to suggest framework for handling \npersonal data to give the power of personal data back to \nindividuals. And also, at the same time, the company can also \nuse it freely and across the companies, if individual allow using \nit. We need a new framework that can be balanced the benefits \nof both individuals and companies. \nB. Solutions \nTo solve these two problems, we suggest framework as \nbelow for handling personal data to give the power of personal \ndata back to individuals. And also, at the same time, the \ncompany can also use it freely and across the companies, if \nindividual allow using it. \nAbout this framework, individuals can hold their own \npersonal data in Information bank, and they are able to manage \nand access it whenever they want to use. Information bank is a \nsecured space and individual can't change their own data by \nthemselves, so personal data can be saved safer. And also nindividuals can receive new services, like household account \napplication that can manage how they spend their money and \nso on. At the same time, the company can also use it freely and \nacross the companies, if individual allow using it. \nThis is a new framework that can be balanced the benefits \nof both individuals and companies. \n108 \nThe 8th International Conference for Internet Technology and Secured Transactions ICITST-2013 j n----------------\nc\(impiinTes\n-\na\n-\nncr\n'\n,, \nCollecting the Pers?nal COllect?ng the Personal local govemments \\ \nInformation ' nformatton \n.

How TO HANDLING PERSONAL DATA \nIn this section, we discuss about the structure that is able to nhandle personal data easily by focusing on buying information. \nA. Structure \nIn previous study, to solve the fIrst problems, we studied \nabout system that could get personal data, especially focus on \npurchase information[4]. We made prototype of household \naccount application getting buying information automatically nfrom Point Of Sales systems by using network, and evaluated \nits marketability and effectiveness. On house 


hold account \napplication, we don't see a row data; we can see well-edited \ndata to help them understand easily. \nIn this paper, to aim for the realization of this framework \nand solve the second problems, we studied about system \nstructure that the companies are able to use personal data which \nindividual selected under their control. \nTo build this structure, there are two points: \n• Individual can select which data will they provide and \nwhich companies will be able to use it. \n• Individual who put in control their data and allow using \nit for the companies can receive much more rewards \nthan the other who wouldn't like to participate this \nframework. \nWith these two points in mind, we discussed how to handle \nbuying information nB. Consideration about Buying Information \nWhere and when did you buy? What kinds of things did \nyou buy This information is so-called buying information and \nwe can see these on receipt. On the receipt in Japan there are \n978-1-908320-20/9/$25.00©2013 IEEE \nmuch information as below: The name which you bought, the ncompany which made, the place where you bought, the time \nwhen you bought, the calorie of the meal which you ate at the \nrestaurant, and so on. These have much personal information. \nTo be able to select without any resistance and to allow \nusing it for getting more rewards on this framework, we \nconducted survey research how to handle buying information. \nEspecially wanted to know: \n• Is there any difference by individual? \n What kind of information in buying information does \nindividual want to keep a secret? \nV. THE QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY ON HANDLING \nBUYING INFORMATION \nIn this section, we explain the detail of questionnaire survey \non handling buying information to be able to select without any \nresistance and to allow using it for getting more rewards on this \nframework. And also we show the result of it. \nA. Overview \nAs we have already said, we conducted survey research. \nHere is overview of this questionnaire survey \(Table 1 THIS QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY \nSurvey Technique On the web site and print \nFormat of questions A closed-ended and open-ended questions, \nQuantity of 99 people responses \n• Student and teacher at Graduate School of \nSurvey Population System Design and Management, Keio University on the web site \n• Personal friend on Facebook and print \n109 \nThe 8th International Conference for Internet Technology and Secured Transactions \(ICITST-2013 Male 59%, Female 41 % \n• Married 50%, Unmarried 50% The Rate of Survey \n• 20's 29%, 30's 39%, 40's 19%, 50's and \n60's 13% \nB, Questionnaire \nIn the questionnaire, we asked individuals whether they \nmay give their buying information to the different types of \ncompanies under different cases. \nUnder fIrst case, there is no possibility to identify \nindividuals' behavior. Under second case, there is a few \npossibilities to identify individuals' behavior using date \ninformation. Under last case, there is some possibility to \nidentify individuals' behavior using place information. \nAbout buying information, we grouped it into categories \nsuch as food expense, medical care expense, supplies expenses \nand so on. \nAs for the products in each category, we asked respondents \nto make judgment whether they allow the buying information \nthat consists of product name or product name and date \ninformation, or product name and place information to be \nopened to the companies In this case, the companies were \nclassifIed into major company like Wal-Mart Stores and \nCarrefour S.A small private shop which user knows each \nother, and advertising company like Omnicom Group and WPP \npic nHere is sample about questioners \(Table 2 trade \nname \nFood Costs Trade name + date info \nTrade name + \nplace info \nOnly trade \nname \nInsurance Trade name + \nCosts date info \nTrade name + \nplace info \nOnly trade \nname \nEducational Trade name + \nexpenses date info \nTrade name + \nplace info \nOnly trade \nname \nCommunicati Trade name + \non expenses date info \nTrade name nplace info \nC.

Female \nFig. 2. Differences by Each Category and Gender. \nFigure 2 shows the differences of the results for each \nexpense category. For instance, on category of food and calorie \nof food that you ate more than 90 % people do not mind giving \nthe buying information to the company. In the meantime, on \ncategory of insurance fee and tax fee, around 50% people tend \nto avoid opening to the company. Individuals are extremely \nreluctant to open it. \nIt means that people tend to think categories of insurance \nfee and tax fee are much more sensitive and strong personal \ninformation than categories of food and calorie. If there is some naccident to be identifIed themselves, they do not really want to \nopen it and also anyone to know it nTherefore, there are some expense categories that \nindividuals feel reluctant to open, and there are other expense \ncategories that individuals feel free to open. We could say that \nthere are differences among each category. \nAlso fIgure 2 shows the result for the differences of gender. \nFor instance, more female tend to 


avoid opening personal data, \nwhich is not only sensitive data like medical care cost, \ninsurance, and educational fee but also food cost, to small \nprivate shop than male. It means that female tend to avoid nopening it to close shop/person. However male does not care \nabout it. And also more female tend to avoid opening food \ncalorie to close shop/person than male. \nMoreover, female do not care about place information but \nmale tend to avoid opening it. They do not want to open it \nmuch more than date information. For male place information \nis much more sensitive data and they do not want other people \nto ever know. \nTherefore there are differences between male and female. \nFigure 3 shows the differences between married and \nunmarried For instance, more than 60% unmarried people tend \nto feel free to open their food fee cost to the company nHowever there are only about 45% married people tend to feel \nfree to do it.

Though some \nanswerers want to get many rewards like cash, services and nattractive information, others do not want to any rewards even \nthey open it to the company. It seems that the opinions of \nrecent people have become different compared to previous \nresearch [4]. \nTABLE Ill.

Digital signage is an electronic display that \nshows information, advertisement, map and so on. In these \ndays, we are easy to touch it at station, airport, department \nstore, hospital and so on nUsually digital signage shows information to us one-sidedly, \nor people have to search to get useful information. To get \nuseful information for them, it takes a little bit long time and \nsometime it is getting trouble. And also, sometimes we could \nnot find out and miss what they want to get. \nOur idea is placing digital signage system at shopping \ncenter or tourist information center that presents the \npersonalized information to the users who allow using their \nown personal data and open it to the advertising company using nthe collaborative filtering method based on the personal data. \nIn this case, a template shown in Fig 5 is used so that the user \ncan select the categories of buying information that is given to \nthe advertising company. On Fig 5, vertical scale indicates the \nlevel on a zero-to-ten scale that individual does not mind to nopen their information to the companies. \(Ex: If individual \ndoes not mind to open at all, the rate is lO. If do not want to \nopen at all, the rate is 0 the digital signage system \nplaced in the public space. \nIn our idea, the companies that want to give useful ninformation to customers are able to give personalized \ninformation like order-made service by using their personal \ndata under their control.

CONCLUSION \nIn this paper, to solve the problems that there is no \nreasonable 


way to give our personal data to the companies \nunder our control and we are not able to receive a proper nreward from companies, we have suggested the system \nstructure that the companies are able to use personal data which \nindividuals selected under their control. \nTo build this structure, we had to consider two points 1 individuals who allow the \ncompanies to use their personal data under their control can \nreceive much more rewards than the others who wouldn't like \nto participate in this framework. To be able to select data and ncompany that can be allowed without any resistance for getting \nmore rewards on this framework, we conducted survey \nresearch how to handle buying information. \nWe got results from it: There is a gap between individuals. \nSome wants to open their personal data, but the other do not. \nSome wants to manage their own data, but the other do not. \nTherefore, to build this structure to give rewards back to \nindividual without any stress, it is very important to accept \neach individual's requests. \n978-1-908320-20/9/$25.00©2013 IEEE nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nIn this research, I am deeply thankful to people who \ncooperated with doing the questionnaire. \nREFERENCES \n[ I] Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, "Infonnation and nCommunications in Japan white paper 2012 nhttp://www.soumu.gojp/johotsusintokei/whitepaper/jalh24/pdVindex.ht \nml, 20 I2 \n[2] Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, "Competent Budget", \nhttp://www.soumu.go.jp/main _ contentlOOO 199023. pdf, 2012 n[3] JIPDEC, "Personal Information Protection Policy", \nhttp://wwwjipdec.or.jp/englindex.html \n[4] Yuri Nakagawa, Toru lzui, Akira Isegawa, Kentaro Arai, Masanori \nSonoda, Masahiko Narita, and Tetsuro Ogi Proposed Framework for \nCollecting and Handling Personal Data", IEICE TRANSACTIONS on \nInformation and Systems D, VoI.J95-D, No.4, pp.S25-S33, 2012 \(in \nJapanese  personal data: Learning from the \nAmerican discourse", Computer law & Security review 25, pp507-521, \n2009 n[6] Department for Business, Innovation & Skills on GOV.UK, "midata nhttps:!/www.gov.uklgovernmentlpolicies/providing-better-information­\nand-protection-for-consumers \n[7] World Economic Forum, "Rethinking Personal Data: Strengthening \nTrust", \nhttp://www3.weforum.orgldocs/WEF_IT _ RethinkingPersonalData _Rep \nort_20I2.pdf, 20 I2 \n[S] S.Mann, "'WearCam' \(The Wearable Camera Imaging \nSystems for long--term use in wearable tetherless computer--mediated \nreality and personal PhotolVideographic Memory Prosthesis," Proc.of \nISWC, pp.124- I3 I, Washington, I99S. \n[9] K.Aizawa, T.Hori S.Kawasaki, T.Ishikawa, "Capture and efficient \nretrieval of life log," Pervasive 2004 Workshop on Memory and Sharing \nExperiences, pp.15-20, Vienna, Austria, Apr. 20, 2004. \n[10] Ig-Jae Kim, Sang Chul Ahn, Heedong Ko and Hyoung-Gon Kim, \n"Automatic Lifelog Media Annotation based on Heterogeneous Sensor \nFusion," IEEE International Conf. on Multisensor Fusion and \nIntegration for Intelligent Systems, Aug., 200S. \n[ I I] Lina Zhou, Ammar S.

Similarly, the events i2, . . .  , ie E St do not \ndepend on any random variables other than the variables in \n{Rj I i2 < j <:: t}. Since the random variables Ris are chosen nindependently at random and the sets {Rj I i l < j <:: i2} \nand {Rj I i2 < j <:: t} are disjoint, the events i l E Si2 and \nn!?2 Aik are independent; that is, \nBy Lemma 3.1, we have Pr {i l E Si2} = t; = Pr {i l E St nPr {Ail} and thus, \nNext, by using Eqn. 9 and applying induction on £, we \nprove Eqn. 8.

For any given k E V, finding of j, where k E Vj \(Line \n9, Algorithm 3.1 done efficiently, preferably in \nconstant time without communicating with the other \nprocessors. \nB. The partitioning should lead to a good load balancing. \nThe degrees of the nodes vary significantly, and a node nwith a larger degree causes more messages to work \nwith. As a result, naive partitioning may lead to poor nload balancing. \nC. As we discuss later, combining multiple messages \(to \nthe same destination MPLsend oper­\nation for them can increase the efficiency of the al­\ngorithm. However, combining multiple messages may \nnot be possible with an arbitrary partitioning as it may \ncause deadlocks. \nWith the objective of satisfying the above criteria, we \nstudy the following nodes partition schemes. \n3.5.1 Consecutive Node Partitioning \(CP Partition Vi starts at nodes ni and \nends at nHl - 1, where no = 0 and np = n. That is, \nVi = {ni, ni + 1 niH - I} for all i. \nWith the consecutive node partitioning, the only decision \nto be made is the number of nodes to be assigned to each \npartition Vi. The simplest way to do so is uniform parti­\ntioning \(UCP there are an equal number of nodes \nin each partition, i.e., IViI = I? l for all i. This uniform \npartitioning satisfies Criterion A and C above; however, it is \nclear that such partitioning can lead to poor load balancing. \nThe computation in each processor i involves the following \nthree types of load: \nA. generating random numbers and some other processing \nfor each node t E Vi, \nB. sending request messages for the nodes in 


Vi and re­\nceiving their replies, and \nC. receiving request messages from other processors and \nsending their replies. \nThe computation load for load type A and B above is di­\nrectly proportional to the number of nodes in partition Vi. \nComputation load for load type C depends not only on the \nnumber of nodes in a processors but also on i, the rank of \nthe processor. With uniform consecutve node partitioning \n\(UCP processor receives more request mes­\nsages than a higher ranked processor, because with j < k, \nE[N!j E[MkJ, where Mk is the number of request mes­\nsages received for Node k \(see Lemma 3.4 the number of request messages \nreceived for node k. Then E[Nh] = \(1 - p Hn-l - Hk harmonic number. \nPROOF. Node k receives a request message from node t > \nk if and only if t randomly picks k and decided to assign Fk \nto Ft. The probability of such an event is \(1 -p messages received for Node k is given \nby \nD \nn-l 1 \nL \(1 - p 1 - p Hn-l - Hk the computation load for each processor \nwith an arbitrary number of nodes assigned to the proces­\nsors. To do so, we make the following simplifying assump­\ntions: i receiving a message, and ii the same anal­\nysis will follow for arbitrary p by simply multiplying each nterm with 2\(1 - p A and B \nis c\(ni+l - ni i is \nn'i+l-1 \nL \(Hn-1 - Hk niH - ni Hk niH - ni ni+lHni+l niHnJ + \(niH - ni niH - ni Hn-1 + 1 nHIHni+l - niHnJ \nThe second last line follows from Eqn. 2. 36 in page 41 of \n[15] . Thus, using another constant b = 1 + c, the total \ncomputation load at Processor i is \n\(nHl n Hn-1 + b niHHni+l - niHnJ \nThe combined load for all processors is c' n for some con­\nstant c' and desired load in each processor is c?n.

Slope d can be \napproximated easily by sampling two points on the actual \nline. How the parameter a and processor rank form a given \nnode \(Criterion A computed is given in Appendix \nA.2. \nMessage Buffering: The processors exchange two types \nof messages request messages and resolve messages. For \neach node t ,  a processor may need to send one request mes­\nsage and receive one resolve message. If a Processor i has \nmultiple messages destined to the same processor, say Pro­\ncessor j, Processor i can combine them into a single mes­\nsage by buffering them instead of sending them individually. \nEach processor can do so by maintaining P -1 buffers, one \nfor each other processor. If the messages are not combined, \nfor large n, there can be a large number of outstanding mes­\nsages in the system and the system may not be able to deal \nwith such a large number of messages at a time, limiting our \nability to generate a large network. Further message buffer­\ning reduces overhead of packet header and thus improves nefficiency. \n3.5.2 Round-Robin Node Partitioning \(RRP robin fash­\nion among all processors. Partition Vi contains the nodes \n\(i, i+p, i+2p, ... , i+kp i+kp::; n < i+ \(k+ l mod p' Similar to UCP, in this RRP \nscheme also, the number of nodes in the partitions is almost \nequal. The number of nodes in a partition is either I nip l or \nl nip J. The difference between the number of nodes in two \npartitions is at most 1 .  \nFrom Lemma 3.4, it is clear that the expected number \nof received messages decreases monotonically with increas­\ning node labels. Round robin partition on such monotonic \ndistribution typically performs better. For the round robin \nnode partitioning scheme, the computation load among pro­\ncessors are well-balanced as shown analytically in Appendix \nA. 3. The difference between the computation load for any \ntwo processors is at most O\(log n n

The request messages \ncan be buffered as it is done in UCP or LCP. The resolved \nmessage can also be buffered, but it needs to be done in a \nspecial way to avoid deadlock. To avoid deadlock, resolved \nmessages must be sent out from the buffer \(even if the buffer \nis not full yet processing every group of received mes­\nsages \(when buffering is used, messages are sent and received \nin groups the \nprocessors leading to a deadlock situation. \n4. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS \nIn this section, we evaluate the performance of our algo­\nrithms. Our parallel algorithms' accuracy is demonstrated \nby showing that the algorithm produces networks with power \nlaw degree distribution. Then we present the strong and \nweak scaling of the algorithms. These algorithms scale very \nwell with the number of processors. We also present ex­\nperimental results showing the impact of the partitioning \nschemes on load balancing and performance of the algo­\nrithms. \n4.1 Experimental Setup \nWe used a high performance computing cluster of 48 Intel \nSandy Bridge nodes. Each node consists of two dual-socket \nIntel Sandy Bridge E5-26 70 2.60GHz 8-core processors \(16 ncores per node inter­\nconnects. For the MPI based implementation of our algo­\nrithms, we used the MPICH2 \(version 1 . 7 which optimized \nfor QLogic InfiniBand cards. \nIn the experiments, we used up to 768 processors. We \nvaried n from 107 to 109 and x from 4 to 10. Each of the \nalgorithms we considered generates the network in the main nmemory, and the runtime does not include the time required \nto write the graph into the disk. \n4.2 Degree Distribution \nThe degree distribution of the graph generated by our \nparallel algorithm is shown in Figure 4 in a log -log scale. \nWe used n = 109 nodes each adding x = 4 new edges with \na total of 4 x 109 edges. \nAs the figure shows, the distribution is heavy tailed, which \nis a distinct feature of the real-world power-law networks. \nThe exponent I of this power-law degree distribution is mea­\nsured to be 2. 7, which supports the fact that for a finite av­\nerage degree of a scale-free network, the exponent I satisfies \n2 < I < 00 [9]. The above results show that our algorithms \nproduce scale-free networks very accurately. \n4.3 Strong Scaling nStrong scaling of a parallel algorithm shows its perfor­\nmance with the increasing number of processors keeping the \nproblem size fixed. Figure 5 shows speedup factors of our \nalgorithms with partitioning schemes uniform consecutive \nFigure 4: The degree distribution \(in log -log scale parallel algorithms. \nThe network is generated with n = 109 and x = 4. \n\(UCP LCP round-robin parti­\ntioning \(RRP Speedup factors are mea­\nsured as 1?/1?, where 1? and 1? are the running time of \na sequential algorithm and the parallel algorithm, respec­\ntively. We have implemented the sequential version of our \nalgorithm in C This sequential implementation outper­\nforms the best available implementation of BA model given \nin NetworkX graph algorithm library [16]. As the sequential \nalgorithm cannot generate more than 6 x 109 edges due to nmemory limitation, we choose n = 109 and x = 6. We varied \nthe number of processors from 1 to 768 for this experiment. \n250 \n200 \ni150 \n[t100 \n50 \n200 400 600 \nNumber of Processors \n_ucp \n........ LCP \n...... RRP nFigure 5: The strong scaling of our parallel algo­\nrithms for the problem size n = 109 and x = 6 nParallelization of network algorithms is notoriously hard. \nFurthermore, we have observed that the problem of gener­\nating a scale-free random network is quite sequential in na­\nture due to the dependencies among the edges. As Figure 5 \nshows, the speedups of our algorithms are increasing almost \nlinearly with the number of processors. Given the sequen­\ntial nature of the problem, our algorithms show very good \nspeedup. Further, the speedup of both LCP and RRP is \nbetter than UCP, due to better load-balancing as discussed \nin Section 4.6 n4.4 Weak Scaling \nThe weak scaling measures the performance of a parallel \nalgorithm when the input size per processor remains con­\nstant. For this experiment, we varied the number of pro­\ncessors from 16 to 768. With the number of processors, the \ninput size is also increased proportionally: for P processors, \na network with 107 P edges is generated. Figure 6 shows the \nweak scaling of our algorithms with the increasing number \nof procesors. \nIn a perfect weak scaling case, the runtime is expected to \nremain constant as the number of processors \(P nFigure 6: Weak scaling of our parallel PA algorithm. \nHowever, in practice, communication among processors in­\ncreases with P, leading to an increase in runtime. Our al­\ngorithm with load balancing schemes LCP and RRP show \nvery good weak scaling, almost constant runtime. Again, \ndue to poor load balancing in UCP scheme, we 


have worse \nweak scaling. \n4.5 Generating Large Networks \nOur main goal for designing this algorithm is to generate \nvery large random networks. Using our algorithm with the \nRRP scheme, we are able to generate a network with 50 \nbillion edges, with n = IE and x = 5. Using 768 processors, \nthe generation of this network takes only 123 seconds. \n4.6 Partitioning and Load Balancing \nN ode partitioning has significant effects on load balanc­\ning and performance of the algorithm. In Section 3.5, we \nhave discussed three partitioning schemes UCP, LCP and \nRRP, and theoretically analyzed them. In this section, we \nexperimentally study these schemes and their effect on the \nperformance of the algorithm. In these experiments, we use \nn = 108 nodes, x 10 edges per node, and 160 processors. \n160 processors are sufficient to demonstrate the behavior and ndifferences of the partitioning schemes. For each of the three \nschemes, we measure the computational load in the proces­\nsors by the number of nodes per processor, the number of \noutgoing messages from the processors and the number of \nincoming messages to the processors. The results are shown \nin Figure 7. \n4.6.1 Node Distribution \nThe node distribution is shown in Figure 7\(a uniformly among the pro­\ncessors, and each processor has about 62,500 nodes. For \nLCP, the number of nodes in the processors are increasing \nlinearly with the rank of the processors. \n4.6.2 Message Distribution \nIn a consecutive partitioning \(UCP and LCP and \nreceives incoming messages from processors i + 1 to P - 1 .  \nFor each node, a processor sends a request message with \nprobability at most 1 - p \(see Eqn. 2 a processor is propor­\ntional to the number of nodes in the processor, as shown \nin Figure 7\(b the UCP and LCP schemes, \nprocessor 0 does not need to send any request messages at \nall. \nFigure 7\(c the number of incoming request mes­\nsages for each processor.

Figure 7\( d shows the total load for the three par­\ntitioning schemes. Scheme RRP distributes the load almost \nperfectly among the processors. Load balancing in the LCP \nscheme is also quite good. On the other hand, UCP scheme ndistribute the load very poorly. These experimental results \nverify our theoretical analysis given in Section 3.5. \n5. CONCLUSION \nWe developed a parallel algorithm to generate massive \nscale-free networks using the preferential attachment model. \nWe analyzed the dependency nature of the problem in detail \nthat led to the development of an efficient parallel algorithm \nfor the problem. Various node partitioning schemes and \ntheir effect on the algorithm were discussed as well. Our \nalgorithm produces networks which strictly follow power-law \ndistribution. The linear scalability of our algorithm enables \nus to produce 50 billion edges in just 123 seconds. It will be \ninteresting to develop scalable parallel algorithms for other \nclasses of random networks in the future. \n6. REFERENCES \n[1] R. Albert, H. Jeong, and A.-L. Barabasi.

PARTITIONING SCHEME \nIn this section, we describe some additional details of the \npartitioning schemes. For a given n nodes and P processors, \nwe create P partitions Vo, V1 , . . .  Vp-1 . The processors are \nlabeled as 0, 1 ,  . . .  P - 1. Partition Vi is processed by pro­\ncessor i. For each scheme, we need to know i of nodes in each partition, and iii Below we show how to calculate them for the three \npartitioning schemes. \nA.1 Uniform Consecutive Partitioning UCP assigned to the par­\ntitions. \nPartition size: The sizes of the partitions are almost equal. \nLet B = I f5 l Then, the size of a partition is either B or \nB -1. \nPartition range: Partition i includes the nodes from iB nto \(i  + I III J . \nA.2 Linear Consecutive Partitioning \(LCP par­\ntitions, and the number of nodes in the partitions are mod­\neled by arithmetic progression a, a+d, a+2d a+\(P- l are partition pal'ame­\nters.

Putting \ni = 0 and i = P -1 in Eqn 10, we can compute nl and \nnp- l .  Then, the number of nodes in the first processor is \nnl - no = nl and the number of nodes in last processor is \nnp - np- l = n - 1 - np- l .

This is because the \ntime in preparation may be very low while the time in space \nmay be very long. If the preparation period will be less than \nseveral weeks then sampling frequency should be ncontinuous or as continuous as feasible . If the preparation \nperiod for launch will occur over many weeks then the \nsampling frequency can be reduced to once/hour. \nIn general, the shorter the preparation time for launch the \nhigher the data sampling frequency is required. Preferably, \nprelaunch activity biological diagnostic data should be \nrecorded continuously and the data available for merging \nwith launch and on-orbit data. After a person initially \narrives in space, the sampling frequency should be \ncontinuous or near continuous . After the person has been in \nspace for several weeks, the sampling frequency can be \nreduced to once/hour. If a person is in space for several \nmonths, the sampling frequency can be reduced to as little \nas once/6 hours . \nTable 2.

CONCLUSION \nA prognostic and health management \(PHM industry telemetry to collect, store and distribute \nto remote locations the biological, diagnostic information \nfor process for predicting mental illness using with \npredictive algorithms .  The predictive algorithms are often \nproprietary and must be developed for use with aerospace \ntelemetry to compensate for the many shortcomings and \ncomplexities of CCSDS telemetry to be accurate and \nreliable. Our proprietary predictive algorithms were \npioneered on the Air Force's GPS satellites and Atlas launch \nvehicles over 30 years ago. They have also been \nsuccessfully used on other military, NASA and commercial \nsatellites, launch vehicles and missiles to illustrate the \npresence of accelerated aging in normal appearing \nequipment telemetry from completely normal behaving \nequipment. \nA behavior of a person ' s  FOFR can explain the cause ntreatment and the cure for mental illness .  The chemicals \n1 8  \nreleased by the FOFR when activated were developed by the \nFOFR to be in the body an extremely short duration. \nToday's  lifestyle has forced people to remain in threatening \nsituations forcing the presence of the toxic chemicals used \nby the FOFR for self preservation to be present for many \nyears at varying levels. The chemicals released by the FOFR \nand release of chemicals that are created as a result of the \nrelease of adrenaline and cortisol cause accelerated aging on \nthe entire body including all areas of the brain. When the \nFOFR is damaged from accelerated aging, it forces the \nbrain 's  chemistry to be altered by changing the ratios of \nthree main chemicals very, causing mental illness .  All the \nmedications used in mental health treat only the symptoms \nof mental illness and do not cure it. \nThe identification of accelerated aging in biological, \ndiagnostic telemetry can be used by ground personnel to \npredict the mental illness in personnel to be used for deep \nspace missions. The model of the brain' s  FOFR subsystem \nprovides the information necessary for the ground crew to \npredict and thus prevent mental illness from occurring by \nmaking the changes to the person ' s  environment. The PHM \nuses information obtained from a variety of mission phases \nincluding pre-launch readiness, launch and during deep nspace travel to develop baseline behavior from which \nmental illness can predicted so it can be prevented nREFERENCES \n[ 1 ] .

specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
