Querying Remote Sensing and GIs Repositories with Spatial Association Rules Giovanni B Marchisio, Krzysztof Koperski and Michael Sanella Data Analysis Products Division of Mathsoft Inc 1700 Westlake Ave N Suite 500 Seattle Washington, 98109-3044 USA Tel: \(206\283-8802 Fax 206\283-8691 email: piovanni  splus.mathsoft.com krisk@splus.mathsoft.com sannella@splus.mathsoft.com We describe the fusion of multispectral image and GIs data mining functions in a module that implements spatial 
association rules Spatial association rules may represent 1 topological relationships between spatial objects 2 spatial orientation or ordering and 3 distance information Our approach relies on a fast and unique multichannel segmentation algorithm that combines region-based information with edge-based information in a variational framework The indexing strategy distinguishes between three levels of features 1 pixel level 2 region level and 3 scene level features We use pixel level information for the extraction of higher level features 
and in the process of query refinement Region level features describe groups of contiguous pixels Following segmentation we describe each region with a boundary and a number of attributes like spectral endmember types and percentages textural classes shape size, fractal scale, etc We quantify shape, orientation and other geometric properties of the segments by computing 32 moments. Scene level features describe global properties of whole scenes, and the spatial relationships of the largest regions in them The second level of features can optionally support definition of 
semantic labels from multiple attributes which include GIs attributes if present At a higher level we can attempt to construct semantic labels from a tree of topological relationships We store images and features in a database to enable fast access data integrity and easy interfacing with other applications STORAGE AND DATA FUSION Our data mining and information retrieval module I fuses information derived from remotely sensed imagery with GIS information Initially multispectral images are stored as BLOBS in a relational database An 
automatic indexing process attempts to extract a variety of interesting statistical descriptors from the images and stores them as feature indices in the database For each tile we extract pixel level region level and scene level features At an increasing level of information abstraction the storage representations that correspond to each level are raster vector formats and statistical data frames. We achieve data fusion at the second and third level of feature representations. We employ a fast and robust algorithm for automatic region segmentation 
based on multiscale or PDE methods 2 Following 3 we minimize a simplified Mumford and Shah functional. CPU times for the segmentation of a 512x152 Landsat TM image are twenty seconds on a Sun Ultra 60 workstation across six spectral bands. This enables us to segment large databases of Fig 1 a multispectra image of Vancouver, Canada left and the results of the fast region segmentation used in the automated indexing process right images covering large areas in a relatively short time 
As an example in Fig.1 we show the multispectral region segmentation for a 512x512 image tile of Vancouver Canada I I  U Fig 2 System Architecture The spatial descriptions of the regions created by the segmentation process are stored in the ESRI's Spatial Data Engine SDE along with other vector GIs information Our open architecture which is shown in Fig.2 allows uniform storage and access of 
image derived information from a variety of other application modules familiar to the remote sensing community We have designed multispectral data structures which allow the simultaneous representation of classified image, region image, and edge images in a single data structure Image derived features can be used in conjunction with GIS data to build statistical models that explain the relationships between data objects, or to perform information retrieval experiments SDE supports spatial 0-7803-6359-O/OO/$lO.OO 0 2000 IEEE 3054 


operations such as the creation of spatial buffers for proximity operations and spatial joins that can be used to create predicates describing spatial relationships between objects in the database FEATURES Each region in the database contains statistical descriptors that characterize image derived information such as the relative abundances of spectral reflectances textural classes, textural orientation, size, fractal scale and shape. We perform localized Spectral Mixture Analysis \(SMA and store relative endmember fractions for each region The preferred method of textural characterization is based on Gabor wavelets These seem to outperform other methods for texture analysis such as edge attribute processing the circular simultaneous autoregressive model and hidden Markov model methods 5 For each pixel we extract eight features U i=O,7 with Gabor kernels rotated by id8 Following 6 we compute rotational invariant features by takmg the values of the autocorrelation function ti  lai 1 x lumod\(i j,8 I  To minimize the size of the index we have chosen to compute values of the autocorrelation for j=0,2,4 These values correspond to the 0 45 and 90 difference in the orientation of Gabor kernels. This selection is sufficient for detecting urban road networks. Our approach also allows for the extraction of other microfeatures such as frequency and orientation We show an example of region level texture features in Fig.3 for an area of Greater Vancouver, Canada covered by 9 Landsat TM tiles In this example we cluster the values of autocorrelation for each pixel into 12 groups The region and scene level feature indices store the percentage of pixels within each particular region and scene that belong to each of the clusters We present SMA features corresponding to the same area of Fig.4 We use four endmember reflectances and compute their relative abundance in each segment The map labels each region by the dominant endmember If there is no dominant endmember as it is the case in some suburban areas, the label is none We quantify the shape of each region by computing and storing 32 moments. Our indexing methodology enables the fusion of image derived information with auxiliary GIS information such as land use zoning hydrographic or transportation network overlays and demographic information The data mining functions enable joint statistical analysis and similarity searches in these hybrid data repositories For instance a user can perform queries by image content \(QBIC with the constraint that the retrieved region\(s must be close to a major highway 7 i=O Fig 3 Region Level Texture Features Fig 4 Region Level SMA Features SPATIAL ASSOCIATION RULES A spatial association rule is of the form X Y c where X and Y are sets of spatial or non-spatial predicates and c is the confidence of the rule 7 An example of a spatial association rule is prevulent-endmembetfx concrete A texture-cluss\(x CI close-to\(x coastline 60 This rule states that 60 of regions where concrete is the prevalent endmember and that texture features belong to class C1 are close to the coastline There are various kinds of spatial predicates that could constitute a spatial association rule Examples include topological relations such as intersects overlap and disjoint spatial orientations such as lefi-of and west-oJ and distance information such as close-to or far-uwuy Spatial association rules in databases of remotely sensed images could be discovered at the pixel region or scene levels The process of finding spatial association rules at the pixel level is computationally intensive On other hand association rules at the scene level may be too general We concentrate therefore on finding spatial association rules at the region level. We initiate the mining process with a query that specifies the objects, the attributes, and the predicates to be used in the rules Minimum support and minimum confidence thresholds filter out associations that describe small percentage of objects and rules with low confidence To minimize the number of costly spatial computations performed the algorithm first uses various approximations like Minimum Bounding Rectangles MBRs to find coarse predicates then it applies finer but more expensive spatial 3055 


computations only to those patterns having large support at the approximation level 7 INFORMATION RETRIEVAL EXPERIMENTS Our information retrieval module employs an SQL like query language that allows the user to specify the data mining task feature\(s to be used in the mining process and input additional constraints The system can perform similarity searches based on any combination of features We can perform QBIC searches at the scene or region level, weight features differently and introduce thresholds in the search For instance we may be interested in retrieving only areas that are larger than 2000 pixels In two QBIC experiments on a database covering 3,000 square miles in Western Washington state and British Columbia we compare results based on single and multiple features When only a single feature vector \(SMA\is used the results tend to have a high percentage of areas that could be classified as false hits The selectivity of searches based on SMA features appears to be high for urban areas. However rock outcrops are often mistaken with concrete due to the similarity in spectral signatures The selectivity of searches based on our texture features is lower, but rotation invariance can be observed as urban regions are judged to be similar regardless of the orientation of street networks. For example the suburban area of New Westminster in the Greater Vancouver area is judged to be similar to East Vancouver despite the fact that the main direction of the street network differs by about 30\224 for these two region. Fig 5 presents the result of a search for regions similar to downtown Seattle and Burnaby in British Columbia These searches are at the region level and are based on both texture and SMA features When the query token is an image sample from downtown Seattle, the set of returned regions include many downtown sections of Vancouver Burnaby Bellingham Bellevue Tacoma Everett together with industrial areas of Renton Tukwila and South Tacoma On the other hand regions similar to Burnaby include high density residential areas with some small industrial pockets We also compared results of similarity searches at the region level with searches at the scene level In this case the returned scenes contain only about 40 of the top 20 regions returned by a region level similarity search The features of the smaller regions tend to be overwhelmed by the overall features of the scene CONCLUSIONS Our module for spatial data mining allows the joint statistical analysis of data derived from remotely sensed imagery and GIS information. A key innovation is the support for \223content based\224 searches based on properties of multispectral images Image properties are derived on three levels: pixel, region and image tile Our region level indexing strategy enhances the data analysis and similarity search processes by allowing for the more refined classification of image derived information 10 mi r e Fig.5 Regions Similar to Downtown Seattle, WA \(left and to West Burnaby, BC \(right The system also allows for interactive training of classification models that describe new object types ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Funding for the prototype comes from NASA SBIR Phase I1 contract NAS5-98053.

5 Conclusions We have presented two approaches to enhance LRU based web caching with data mining models built on histor ical data mainly aimed at increasing the hit rate Also the design of a suitable data mart has been presented, together the main problems that such design must solve The ap proaches differ for the kind of data mining model adopted association rules and decision trees The performance figures of the developed methods, com pared with LRU from one side and the theoretical off-line strategy ORCL from the other side, indicate substantial in crease in the hit rate the decision-tree strategy S2 out performs all best fixed strategies LFU LRUMIN SLRU moreover in principle S2 can be combined with the orthog onal association-rule strategy, in such a way that further en hancements may be achieved Although further extensive benchmarking is required there is a strong indication that data mining-based caching yields systematically enhanced hit and weighted hit rates due its adaptiveness to recent history we believe that adaptiveness is indeed the reason that makes our approach preferable to any,fixed caching strategy Directions for further research include the completion of the benchmarking phase with log data from various web and proxy servers as well as synthesized data with various artificial distributions the combination of the association rule and the decision-tree approach into one to investigate other possible metrics to optimize and other possible strate gies to start with considering approaches based on cluster ing References R Agrawal and R Srikant Fast algorithms for mining association rules in large databases In Proceedings 01 the Twentieth International Conference on Very Large Databases pages 487-499 Santiago, Chile, 1994 R Cooley B Mobasher, and J Srivastava Grouping web page references into transactions for mining world wide web browsing patterns In Proc of the 1997IEEE Knowledge and Data Engineering Exchange Workshop KDEX-97 November 1997 0 Etzioni The world-wide web quagmire or gold mine Communications of the ACM 39:65-68 1996 J Han and M Kamber Data Mining Concepts and Techniques Morgan Kaufmann, San Mateo CA 2000 R Kosala and H Blockeel Web mining research A survey ACM SIGKDD Explorations 2 1 1-15,2000 6 T.S Lim W.Y Loh and Y.S Shih A compari son of prediction accuracy, complexity and training time of thirthy-tree old and new classification algo rithms Machine Learning Journal 1999 To appear http://www.Recursive-Partitioning.com/datasets html 7 Microsoft Corporation Microsoft SQL Server 2000 http://www.microsoft.com/sql 8 J R Quinlan C4.5: Programs for Machine Learning Morgan Kaufmann, San Mateo CA 1993 9 S Ruggieri Efficient C4.5 IEEE Trans on Knowledge and Data Engineering 2001 To appear http://www kdd.di.unipi.it 603
