Abstract 
In many applications data mining has to be done in distributed data scenarios In such situations data owners may be concerned with the misuse of data hence they do not want their data to be mined especially when these contain sensitive information Privacy-preserving Data Mining PPDM aims to protect data privacy in the course of data mining Privacypreserving distributed association rules mining protocols have been developed for horizontally partitioned data scenarios with more than two participating parties However they depend on a secure multi-party summary and union computation which cannot guarantee security while the number of participating 
parties is two We use commutative encryption and design a secure division computation protocol as the core techniques to implement the protocols for the privacy-preserving two-party distributed mining of association rule mining The protocols security and performance are analyzed 
I I NTRODUCTION Data mining has gradually become the core technology in decision-making tasks in recent years While widely used however it is faced with many challenges Pri v ac y preser vation is one of these key challenges In man y applications data owners are concerned with the misuse of their data and they do not want sensitive information to be mined With such concerns in mind they are not willing to provide their data for 
any data mining-related activities Signiìcant privacy concerns in data mining also prevent the legitimate use of data For example the 
 enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America forbids the carrying out of data mini ng activities within the U.S Department of Defense unless it is for the purpose of searching public information or owing to particularized suspicion of an individual Data mining ho we v er  may pro vide more insights from data thus bringing huge economic and social interests PPDM makes tradeoffs between data mining contributions and data privacy It aims to carry out data mining

precisely and efìciently while ensuring data privacy 
PPDM research was initiated by two independent research papers 5 4 addresses the PPDM task in the centralized data storage scenario It builds a decision-tree classiìer from the training data in the values of individual records that have been perturbed The main idea is to employ a novel reconstruction procedure to accurately estimate the distribution of original data values By using these reconstructed distributions it is possible to build a classiìer whose accuracy is comparable to the accuracy of classiìers built with original data Meanwhile addresses the PPDM task in the distrib uted data storage scenario It focuses on the issue of ID3 decision tree 
A Related Work 
learning by building efìcient cryptographic protocols based on secure multi-party computation These two studies represent two different research directions in PPDM One is based on the Randomized Perturbation Technique RPT and the other is based on the Cryptography-Based Technique The former is mostly applied to centralized data storage scenarios while the latter is generally used in distributed data storage scenarios PPDM has developed to be a major research direction in the eld of data mining research in recent years It has achieved signiìcant results in many data mining areas such as association rules decision trees 5 clustering 7 outlier detection bayesian netw orks 9 recommender systems  stream mining 11 and social netw ork 12 
Besides there is another PPDM technique called 
anonymity which belongs to the pri v ac y-preserving data publishing techniques Its purpose is to prevent indirect identiìcation of records from public databases because combinations of record attributes can be used to exactly identify individual records But anonymity is believed to be vulnerable When there is little diversity in those sensitive attributes or attackers have additional background knowledge about the victim anonymity encounters severe privacy problems diversity  and

closeness are tw o subsequent techniques closely relative to anonymity and to relieve the problems However all of them havenêt yet resolved the privacy challenges Many research results have indicated that the three closed relative privacy models are vulnerable to various privacy attacks and pride insufìcient privacy protection 27 In recent years differential privacy 29 30 has received considerable attention for PPDM Differential privacy is a model aiming to provide privacy to statistical queries and pattern mining It aims to provide means to maximize

the accuracy of queries or data mining while minimizing the chances of identifying its records Laplace mechanism and exponential mechanism are tw o methods to implementing differential privacy under the scenarios of numeric outputs and discrete outputs There have been considerable studies on applying differential privacy to PPDM so far 34 35  Our study has little relevance to these above papers except that it is closely related to It can be seen as a subsequent work of In comparison with 36 it addresses a dif ferent problem with a different techniques which is a encrypted one but not a differential privacy  presented a method to perform pri v ac y-preserving distributed association rules mining protocols with the assumption of three or more parties at a horizontally partitioned data scenario However the method depends on a secure multi-party summary and union computation which cannot guarantee security while the number of participating parties is two In all nal globally frequent itemsets rules are disclosed to all participating parties In a two-party case it may be argued that knowing an a itemset rule is supported globally but is not supported at oneês site reveals that the other site supports that itemset rule  However we noticed in many cases that knowing whether or not a locally frequent itemset rule at one site is globally supported but not revealing this knowledge to the other site is worthy of investigation For example Walmart may want to know if the rule is strong when putting it under consideration for a transaction union of Walmart and Target but is not willing to reveal to Target that whether the rule is a strong rule of itself or not an owner may want to know if the frequent gene patterns in its gene database are still frequent under the combined database with another one but is not willing to reveal to the other gene database its private data such as the size of the gene database and the frequent gene patterns themselves such motivation does exist in a hospital where its president wants to know whether a nosogenesis generalized from large of patients still works on the combined two patients databases but with some privacy concerns Some researches are devoted to two-party security computation such as and 21 20 initiates the secure tw oparty computation and gi v es its security proof But the y are all about the protocols for the general secure two-party computations which are limited by their time complexity and are not applicable to concrete applications such as data mining tasks Our study can be seen as a complement to 13 as well as a concrete application of the general secure two-party computation protocol in To our knowledge no studies have been conducted to address this gap in knowledge so far In this study therefore we propose a secure division computation protocol based on commutative encryption The proposed protocol works as the core technique to build up protocols that perform privacypreserving two-party distributed mining of association rule mining for the rst time so far as we know which constitute the major contributions of this paper Since in the two-party case knowing an itemset is supported globally but is not supported at oneês own site reveals that the other site supports the itemset this work only needs to examine the problem by way of disclosing the global itemsets to the site at which they are frequent locally but hiding them from the other site The rest of the paper is organized as follows Section II presents the problem deìnitions basic preliminaries and security infrastructures Section III discusses secure multiparty association rule mining protocols and our proposed two-party protocol The analysis of the proposed protocols soundness and security is presented in Sections IV and V In Section VI the performance analysis is shown Finally in Section VII we conclude our paper and identify future work II D EFINITIONS In this section we will give some basic deìnitions of Association Rules Mining Distributed Association Rules Mining and Secure Distributed Association Rules Mining and the security infrastructures Commutative Encryption System on the mining problems Let be a set of items Let be a database of transactions where each transaction consists of a set of items such that  The association rules mining problem can be deìned as follows Let be a set of items Let be a set of transactions where each transaction is an itemset such that  Given an itemset  a transaction contains if and only if  An association rule is an implication of the form  where  and  The rule has support in the transaction database if the probability of a transaction in containing both and is  The association rule holds in the transaction database with if the probability of a transaction in containing and thus is  An itemset with items is called a itemset The problem of mining association rules is that one must necessarily mind all rules whose support is greater than a and whose conìdence is above a  For an itemset  its support is the percentage of transactions in a which contains  and its support count denoted by  is the number of transactions in containing  An itemset is frequent or more precisely frequently occurring if its support is no less than the minimum support threshold It has been shown that the problem of mining association rules can be reduced to two subproblems  1 Find all frequent itemsets for a gi v en minimum support threshold and 2 generate the association rules from the frequent itemsets found Since 1 dominates the overall cost of the mining association rule association rules mining research has focused on the development of efìcient methods to solve the rst subproblem

TABLE I Notation Table This paper investigates the mining of association rules in a distributed environment Let be a database with transactions Assume that there are sites  in a distributed system and the database is partitioned over the sites into  respectively Let the size of the partitions be  for  Let be the global support count and be the local support count of at site  For a given minimum support threshold  is globally frequent if  correspondingly is locally frequent at site if  In the following denotes the globally frequent itemsets in  and the globally frequent itemsets in  The essential task of a distributed association rule mining algorithm is to nd the globally frequent itemsets  A fast algorithm for distributed association rule mining is given in The procedure for the f ast distrib uted mining of association rules FDM can be summarized below 1 Candidate Sets Generation Generate candidate sets based on  itemsets that are supported by at the th iteration using the classic Apriori candidate generation algorithm Each site generates candidates based on the intersection of globally frequent itemsets and locally frequent itemsets 2 Local Pruning For each  scan the database at to compute If is not locally frequent at site  it is excluded from candidate sets  This pruning only removes from the candidate set at site  could still be a candidate set at some other site 3 Support Count Exchange Broadcast the candidate set in to other sites in order to collect support count Compute their global support counts and nd all globally frequent itemsets in site  4 Broadcast Mining Results Broadcast the computed globally frequent itemsets to all the other sites Some basic notations on distributed association rules mining are listed in Table 1 Let be the number of sites Each site has a private transaction database  We are given support threshold and conìdence as the percentages The goal is to discover all itemsets association rules satisfying the thresholds as deìned in Section 2.2 We further desire that disclosure be limited No site should learn the contents of a transaction at any other site what itemsets rules are supported by any other site or the speciìc value of support/conìdence for any itemset rule at any other site unless that information is revealed by knowledge of oneês own data and the nal result The above is the deìnition in Ho we v er  in the case of  we have stated in section 1 that knowing an a itemset rule is supported globally but is not supported at oneês site reveals that the other site supports that itemset rule  So the deìnition for the two-party case is a little different the purpose of our study is to design secure two-party association rules mining protocols to preserve the following data privacy 1 the support and database size of each site are preserved not to be disclosed to the other site 2 each site knows whether or not a locally frequent itemset rule at the own site is globally supported but not revealing this knowledge to the other site To implement the security of multi-party computation a commutative encryption system is necessary We deìne a commutative encryption system as follows Deìnition 1 Commutative Encryption System An encryption system where is the domain of plain and encrypted messages   are sets of encryption keys and decryption keys respectively is commutative if both the encryption function and the decryption function are computable functions in polynomial time deìned on nite computable domains that satisfy all properties listed below We denote   and use to signify  1 For all        each  we have and where   and are four permutations of  2 For all     all  such that and big enough wehave 3 For     the distribution of is indistinguishable from the distribution of  Informally Property 1 denotes that the ciphertext of compositely commutative encryption is identical regardless of the encryption order Property 2 signiìes that two different plain messages will never have the same encrypted messages Property 3 guarantees that the encryption is secure Speciìcally it states that given a plain message and its randomly chosen encryption way  for a new plain message  an adversary

cannot distinguish in polynomial time between and a randomly chosen value from the domain of encrypted messages The adversary cannot identify in polynomial time which of the two plain messages has been encrypted as well Thus the adversary can neither encrypt nor decrypt in polynomial time Some encryption systems satisfy these properties such as DDH Interested readers can refer to 16 for more detailed applications In the following we give the deìnition of Secure Two-party Computation Deìnition 2 Privacy with respect to semi-honest behavior Let be a functionality and resp  denotes the rst resp second element of  Let be a twoparty protocol for computing  The view of the rst resp second party during and execution of on  denoted resp  is resp  where represents the outcome of the rst resp second partyês internal coin tosses and represents the th message it has received The output of the rst resp second party after and execution of on  denoted resp  is implicit in the partyês own view of the execution and  We say that privately computes if there exist probabilistic polynomial-time algorithms denoted and  such that  where denotes computational indistinguishability Deìnition 2 says that under semi-honest model a protocol is said to securely privately compute if the information obtained by every participated party after carrying out the protocol can be polynomially simulated through the participated partyês input and output This method is based on an assumption that the involved parties are semi-honest i.e they follow the rules of the protocol using its correct input but is free to later use what it sees during execution of the protocol to deduce private information In such model a proof is secure if the view of each party during the execution of the protocol can be effectively simulated by the input and the output of the party which is called simulation paradigm mechanism of security proof In our later proofs we use a key theorem in the secure multiparty computation the composition theorem We state it here for the semi-honest model A detailed discussion of this theorem as well as the proof can be found in Fig 1 Determining global candidate itemsets Theorem 1 Composition theorem for the semi-honest model Suppose that is privately reducible to and that there exists a protocol for privately computing  Then there exists a protocol for privately computing  In the theorem  is privately reducible to implies that we can come up with a private protocol for evaluating function given a black box access to function  This allows us to use existing secure protocols as components worrying only that their results do not reveal anything and ignoring the communications carried on by those components III S ECURE A SSOCIATION R ULE M INING P ROTOCOLS In section 3.1 we will illustrate the major idea used in  and its weaknesses In section 3.2 we will introduce our idea on how to securely conduct frequent itemsets mining in two-party case  follo ws the general approach of the FDM algorithm  with special protocols replacing the broadcasts of and the support count of items in  It rst gives a method for nding the union of locally supported itemsets without revealing the originator of the particular itemset It then provides a method for securely testing if the support count exceeds the threshold The idea in follo ws the tw o-phase approach b ut combining locally generated rules and support counts is done by passing the encrypted values between sites The two phases discover candidate itemsets those that are frequent on one or more sites and determine which of these meets the global support conìdence thresholds The rst phase Fig 1 uses commutative encryption Each party encrypts its own frequent itemsets for example site 1 encrypts itemset  The encrypted itemsets are then passed to other parties until all parties have encrypted all itemsets These are passed to a common party to eliminate duplicates and to begin decryption In the gure the full set of itemsets is shown to the left of site 1 after site 1 decrypts This set is then passed to each party and each party decrypts each itemset The nal result is comprised of the distinct itemsets  and in the gure In the second phase Fig 2 each of the locally supported itemsets is tested to see if it is supported globally Fig 2 shows

Fig 2 Determining if itemset support exceeds the 5 percent threshold that the itemset is known to be supported at one or more sites and each computes its local support The rst site chooses a random value and adds to the amount by which its support for exceeds the minimum support threshold This value is passed to site 2 which adds the amount by which its support exceeds the threshold note that this may be negative as shown in the gure This is passed to Site 3 which again adds its excess support The resulting value 18 is tested using a secure comparison to see if it exceeds the random value 17 If so itemset is supported globally This gives a brief oversimpliìed illustration of how the idea in w orks Ho we v er  as the authors stated in their paper the methods were not secure while the number of participating parties is exactly two It is apparent in a twoparty case that 1 when one party knows the nal itemset union it will also know that the itemsets in the union deìnitely belong to the other site and 2 when one party knows the nal summary of the supports it will also know the support of the other site One party can easily deduce the other partyês data from the global results and its own input In this section we will illustrate how to nd globally frequent itemsets as the foundation to preserve the participating parties data privacy We will need to adjust our expectations since the following leakage cannot be avoided One party can easily deduce the other partyês data from the global results and its own input We lower our expectations of knowing whether or not a locally frequent itemset rule at the own site is globally supported but not revealing this knowledge to the other site The following is a concrete application of this expectation For example Walmart may want to know if the rule is strong when putting it under consideration for a transaction union of Walmart and Target but is not willing to reveal to Target that the rule is a strong rule of itself This process is completed in two steps The rst step is to encrypt through both sites which is conducted by Protocol 1 At step 2 in the protocol each site encrypts with its Commutative Encryption System then via step 3 sends the ciphertexts to the other party which again encrypts the ciphertexts received by its own Commutative Encryption System step 6 and sends the results back step 7 The purpose is to conduct secure equality comparison in Protocol 2 making use of the fact that the encryption results of Commutative Encryption System have nothing to do with the encryption order The second step is to nd  which is conducted by Protocol 2 In the protocol one site sends its two-timeencryption ciphertexts one-by-one to the other site step 2 and 3 thus locating its support count at the other sites step 6 7 and 8 Step 11 14 and 15 generate random numbers for the purpose of conducting secure scalar product computation At step 17-27 the two sites conduct a secure scalar product sub-protocol to securely compute the global support of the ciphertext its corresponding plaintext the itemset if the support is not less than the threshold the itemset is a globally frequent itemset and will be added to  Encrypt the candidate sets through both sites  sites Each site  is   owns the gl-frequent itemsets   Each site obtains the set of triples   based on the gl-frequent itemsets  to site  reordered lexicographically each with  resulting in pairs  the pair back to site  reordered lexicographically  the triples based on pairs by replacing each with the corresponding locally frequent itemset and adding its support count  triples by lexicographically There is a place that can be optimized in Protocol 2 the data each site sends to the other site can originate from instead of the triple set that is  Since we assume that if an itemset is globally frequent it must be an element of or  the optimization will avoid wasting time in
