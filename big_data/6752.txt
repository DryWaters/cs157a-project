topic discovery. The major ity of traditional clustering methods, especially for document clustering, are based on the vector space model for distance measure, where the vector is the word profile of a document in the context of the entire corpus. However, algorithms using this measure achieve limited accuracy. In this paper, we propose a semantic measure which incorporates citation semantics \(Citonomy\ into literature \(document\ clustering. Our experimental results show that the performance of clustering can be substantially improved by combining Citonomy and vector space measures  1. Introduction  It is important to find accurate methods for document clustering for several reasons. Such methods 
can aid in increasing both precision and recall in retrieving documents in response to a query. They can also aid in browsing applications where one would like to find documents similar or related to a document of interest. Further, analysis of each cluster may help identify distinct topics, some of which may indicate emerging areas. Finally, they can help one to keep up with the continued increase in the number of publications. A detailed summary of clustering algorithms can be found in [1 m e n t cl u s teri ng algorithms can generally be classified as hierarchical or partitional. Hierarchical algorithms find successive clusters iteratively using previously established 
clusters, whereas partitional algorithms determine all clusters at once. Hierarchical algorithms can be agglomerative \("bottom-up"\ or divisive \("top-down Agglomerative algorithms begin with each element as a separate cluster and merge them into successively larger clusters. Divisive algorithms begin with the whole set and proceed to divide it into successively smaller clusters. The K-means clustering algorithm is a well known partitional algorithm. It partitions a set of data objects into k clusters such that the inter-cluster similarity is low but the intra-cluster similarity high Clustering is typically dependent on the use of a 
pair-wise distance measure between the individual documents to be clustered. The Vector space model VSM com m o n l y us ed f o r th e dis t a n ce m e a s u r e  in document clustering. Each document is represented by a vector of frequencies of terms \(words\ter removing stop words and word stemming \(reducing a word to its canonical form\ practice, the term frequency is usually the weighted frequency, e.g., TFIDF \(term frequency inverse document frequency The idea of combining IDF with TF is that if a term is highly frequent across different documents, then it 
would have little discriminating power, and vice versa  To c o m p u t e th e s i m i larit y bet w een t w o docum e n t s   the corresponding vector representations are used to calculate measures like the inner product, dice coefficient and cosine coefficient Two major problems with VSMs are low accuracy and speed. First, since each vector is the list of frequencies of words of a document, the semantics may be misinterpreted. For example, suppose document A  states A man is walking a dog  document B states Man and dog are both animals 
and document C  states A girl is riding a bike  Documents A and C  should arguably be in the same cluster since both describe people s outdoor activity or exercise, while B  may be a document on biological classification However, based on the vector space model A and B  would end up in the same cluster since they would have higher similarity with each other than with C  Even though word stemming may be applied to infer 
semantic equivalence of lexical variants, terms \(or words\ting synonyms in a particular domain may still be identified as different terms \(or words this leads to low similarity of documents on the same topic that use different terms \(words\er to the same concepts, thus resulting in low accuracy low precision and/or low recall. Second, with large documents, the vector space model suffers from high dimensionality which makes the computation of Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 1 978-0-7695-3450-3/09 $25.00 © 2009 IEEE 


 weighted frequencies and similarity of documents quite costly, thus leading to long running times To solve these problems, clustering methods have been proposed that can be categorized into two-stage clustering \(e.g term f r equ e n c y bas e d \(e.g 5 and domain knowledge \(or ontology\ed \(e.g. [6  T e rm  f r equ e n c y bas e d m e t h ods t e n d t o o v erl ook small clusters and ontology based approaches can still suffer from the problem of high-dimensionality depending on the domain In this paper, we focus on improving accuracy of clustering by incorporating citation semantics, which we refer to as Citonomy. One can infer some semantics of a paper based on the references it cites. The rationale behind using Citonomy in document clustering is that documents on the same topic are likely to cite papers on similar topics, but not necessarily the same papers. This implies that the references cited by documents on the same topic will have similar semantics. This scheme could potentially be combined with the vector space model \(and/or domain ontology\ieve higher accuracy in document classification. It is important to clarify that Citonomy is more than simple co-citation counting. As suggested in [8  c o c i t a t i o n c o unt i n g i s  use f ul  a n d i t  could help improve document retrieval. To some extent, co-citation can reflect the semantic similarity of the citing documents, but it is not always the case. For exam cited b y both  10, 1 1 bu t th es e are i n  totally different areas. In contrast to co-citation counts Citonomy is based on clustering the list of references of each document followed by document level clustering based on comparison of respective citation clusters  2. Related work  A two-stage technique for large dataset clustering is presented in redu ce t h e cos t of com p u t ations incurred by the vector space model. The idea is to use a cheap, approximate distance measure to divide the data documents\to overlapping subsets called canopies followed by clustering based on measuring exact distances only between points that occur in a common canopy. The problem with this approach is that the user needs to have knowledge of the domain to choose the appropriate distance measure. In addition the threshold of distance has to be chosen carefully. If it is too big, there will be only a few canopies which do little to reduce the problem of high- dimensionality; if it is too small, low quality clustering results The authors of pos ed a tex t clu s teri ng method using frequent-terms instead of the entire vector space. The problem is the setting of the threshold of term frequency if it is too big, many small clusters will be overlooked thus resulting in low clustering quality; if it is too small, the term frequent terms loses its meaning and one ends up with only a small reduction in vector space Several researchers have noticed the importance of domain knowledge in document clustering \(e.g. [7  6    In an on tology  w a s u s ed f o r con c ept s e lection to restrict the set of document features\ and automatic aggregation; In Medical Su bj ect Headin gs   a s  u s ed to redu ce v e c t or s p ace dim e n s io n a lit y   The approach presented in [1 s es ph ras e s i n s t ead o f  words to form vector space to reduce its dimensionality. Even though no explicit ontology was used in e h i erarch ic al ph ras e s th e y extract  during their preprocessing stage can be considered a form of domain knowledge. This approach is domaindependent in the following ways. First, it depends on whether there is an ontology available for a given domain. Second, it also depends on the quality of such ontologies. As the authors point out in e accu r ac y of the method also depends on which clustering algorithm is used; they found that hierarchical algorithms did not gain any benefit from using MeSH Citations have attracted the attention of several researchers. The most popular research topics regarding citations are citation network or citation indexing \(e.g. [8, 14d citation  f i eld e x tractio n e.g. [8, 17Bot h 21, 22 t r i e d t o u s e s u rroun di ng sentences of citations to find information of cited paper or relation between citing paper and cited paper. The authors of rop os ed a s c h e m e an d su perv is ed  machine learning framework to classify and annotate citation functions which could be potentially used in labeling citation network and paper level assertions e.g. Paper A Contrasts with Paper B Except n o n e  of them mentioned the potential for citations to be used in document clustering. Howeve c u s s e d cocitation counting which is different from what we propose in this paper, as explained below  3. Citonomy  3.1 Process of Citonomy Clustering Citonomy is a publication clustering framework based on citation semantic measurement and similarity of publications. A two-level approach has been adapted First, for each publication, we perform citation clustering by analyzing reference information within the publication. Second, for clustering of publications we perform a clustering based on the citation semantic similarity between papers using K-Medoids variant of K-Means clustering. The Citonomy process involved the following steps \(Fig. 1 Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 2 


 1  Preprocessing  Formatting We located and stored titles of the references in the bibliography, the sentence surrounding each citation within the text, and information on which references are cited together Stopword removal and stemming As with most document clustering methods, we removed stopwords to reduce noise and the space of the data. We performed word stemming to account for lexical variation. We used the Porter Stemming algorithm for this 2  Citation Clustering and Annotation  First, we generated similarities between the references cited by a paper, defined by Formula \(8\econd, we used Markov Chain algorithm \(MCL o r clustering based on those similarities. Third, we labeled these citation clusters as discussed in Sec. 3.2 3\ Document Clustering  In our experiments, we used the Citonomy similarity measure, defined by Formula \(5\ as the similarity measure to perform K-Medoids clustering of the documents. Since there were no keywords provided in any of these papers, the keyword weight \(Table 1  was essentially set to zero  3.2 Citation clustering The three elements we use for this clustering include: 1\Title of Reference 2\rrounding Sentences 3\ Citation Locality. We use both explicit lexical evidence and implied semantic evidences to cluster all references of a given paper. By lexical evidence we mean the literal title of a reference. By semantic evidence, we mean the surrounding sentences and citation locality. The latter refers to the fact that if two or more papers are cited as a group in a paper, they are likely to be on very similar topics The surrounding sentence, or Citance as named in e rs to part of th e sentence close to a reference number in a paper, either before or after the specific location of the citation. For example, in The threshold algorithm works as follows 12  the words The threshold algorithm works as follows are taken as the surrounding sentence of reference 12 since the sentence ends with the number. In Jones et al. [10  exa m in e su b s titu tio n s  that searchers make to their queries   examine substitutions that searchers make to their queries is treated as the surrounding sentence for reference 10 For consistency, we use period-to-period bounds in our experiments. That is, we take the whole sentence that mentions one or more references as the corresponding surrounding sentence. Our experimental results show no difference between this approach and that of taking a subset of a surrounding sentence The bracket information, or citation locality, is the information on which references are cited together in the same context of a paper. For example, if we see 13, 21 in a paper, then reference 13 and 21 have been explicitly considered to be the same kind of papers by the author. So when we perform clustering of references, it s important to consider this fact We consider three types of evidence when measuring the similarity of every pair of references  titles, surrounding sentences, and bracket information Titles and surrounding sentences are both considered sentences but will be compared separately, that means we will compare title to title, surrounding sentences to surrounding sentences. It makes sense to preserve individual semantics since the reference title is given by the author of the cited paper while the surrounding sentences st 1 and st 2 are written by the author citing that reference. The similarity of two sentences st 1 and st 2 is computed as follows   1               2 1 2 1 2 1 st terms st terms count st terms st terms count st st S      In other words, the similarity between two sentences equals the number of common terms of these two sentences divided by the total number of unique terms in the sentences. For given papers p 1 and p 2 this formula is used for similarities of titles and surrounding sentences      2 1 p t p t S and      2 1 p s p s S and the value range is between 0 and 1 Fig. 1.

 The total similarity is given by  2                    2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 p b p b S p s p s S p t p t S p p ST     where      2 1 p p b S determines the citation locality of two papers, p1 and p2 and depending on the locality  it returns 1 or 0. If two references 13 and 21, are mentioned together 13,21 the citing paper 1  21  13    b S otherwise 0  21  31    b S  In our semantic clustering method, we start with clustering citations \(references\ each paper separately. For the citation clustering, we use MCL Markov Clustering Algorithm [25  usi n g t h e  similarities we have computed for citations. Once we get clusters of references using MCL with similarity measure defined by \(1\d \(2\we can automatically label the resulting clusters. We label each cluster by the most frequent terms, namely, we use those terms that occur in half or more than one half of the members references\ a given cluster. In principle, we could use single words or phrases as labels. In the experiments discussed in this paper, we use single words as labels. Since there could potentially be several terms that exceed the criterion \(half or more the user can choose top n terms as labels. Fig. 2 shows an example of citation clustering and semantic annotation.  In this example, six citation clusters are identified and each citation cluster is annotated with up to ten most frequent terms. To create several ideal  clusterings, we generated multiple document combinations \(see Table 3\ for subsequent use in testing our citation semantics approach for document clustering 3.3 Document Clustering Document clustering is the second level clustering in the Citonomy that relies on the citation clustering   he eval uation of  f a c i al paral y s i s  h e tru e n a tur e o f B e l l s pals y analy s is of 1000 con s ecutiv e p a ti ents  i denc e and r i sk  f a ctors f o r B e ll s pals y  in Lare ndo T e xas  1 9 74 1 98 2  i denc e pr ognosis and rec o v e r y of B e l l s pal s y  A s u rve y of ab out 1000 patients 1 974 1 983  o m e ob ser v ati ons on B e ll  s pals y  i n B e lf ast dur i ng the per i o d 1949 1 958  i denc e and p r ognosis o f B e ll's pals y i n th e population of R o c h ester  Mi nn es ota  p i d em i c i n c i den ce o f  B e ll's pals y  i e A u sw irk u n g v on K auf die Funk ti o n des N e r v us  f a cial is  a cial ne rve pal s y du r i ng pr egnanc y  r incipal C o m p onent A naly s i s  ia te S t atistica l Methods: A P r i m er  S i g n i f i c ance T e st for P r i n c i pa l  C o m ponents A p pl ied to a C y cl o n e C l i m atol og y  o variabil i t y and C l i m a t ic C hange s o f the Low erT r oposph ere Tem per atures ov er the N o r t hern  p pl ied Mu l t iv ar i a te T e ch ni ques   a cial P a ral y s i s  t m o s p h e r i c P r essur e a n d Idi o pat hi c Facial P a r a l y s i s B el l  s P als y   onepidem i c incidence  of i d iopathic f a c i al par aly s is.

 The citation semantic similarity S cise of documents A and B can be summarized in the following formula    6  1  1 1    2 1      M i B N A N L i S cise S   7   2  2 2 2 2  1 1 1 2    iN R rtiN N rciN N i R rti N rci N i R rti N rci N Max L i S       where M Min N A  N B d  N = Max N A  N B each citation cluster has only one label S i L could only be 0 or 1; However, if we allow a citation cluster to have multiple labels, then S i L could be a fraction. For example, if one cluster C a1 in A has labels L a L b L c  and another cluster in C b1 in B has labels L a L b L d  then S i L will be 2/3 R ij   i=1 M; j=1 N is defined as follows  8        rj R ri R Max rj R ri R Min ij R    Assuming  A B N N  for every citation cluster in B we try to find a corresponding citation cluster in A which has the highest similarity using Formula \(7\, and calculate the meta-ratio using Formula \(8\hen we use Formula \(6\et the overall similarity of citation semantics of documents A and B see Fig. 3  4. Experimental results and discussion We downloaded Pubmed Central \(PMC access articles from e ch os e t w el v e cate g ories  corresponding to topical j ournals as our original clusters as shown in Table 2. We evaluated our results according to these clusters  Table 2.

This data set was used to develop our citation semantics approach of document clustering and also to obtain appropriate weights for Formulas \(5\d \(3\or \(4\The document sets involved in each combination were used as the ground truth for evaluating our clustering results. Note that the combinations in Table 3 are only from the first eight categories of Table 2. The remaining four categories were held back to test the robustness of our approach  Table 3.

In other words, we performed K-Medoids clustering using the similarity measure specified in Formulas \(3\d \(4\with W 1 0 and W 2 1. Before clustering using different combinations of strategies, we did clustering by using title only, citation clustering only, and co-citations only. The average F-Measures are 29.9%, 59.3%, and Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 


 35.8%, respectively. Intuitively, we expect to find a higher F-Measure on combining the three approaches Also, since using citation clustering results in the highest individual F-Measure among these three, a higher weight on citation clustering is likely to give better results The average F-Measures in Fig. 4 show that when the weights W 3 W 5 W 6 are biased towards citation clustering \(note high values of W 5 e get the highest values of the F-Measure, which coincides with our expectation. In other words, when we assign more weight to the semantic similarity between reference clusterings, we get better results of document clustering. Assigining more weight to the similarity between titles or to number of co-citations does not improve document clustering.  For example, the FMeasures of 10:1:1, 1:1:10 and 10:1:10 are all less than that of 1:1:1; the F-Measure of 1:10:10 is better than that of 1:1:1, but less than that of 1:10:1      Fig. 4. Citonomy Clustering F-Measure  Among the weight ratios 1:5:1, 1:10:1, 1:15:1 1:20:1, 1:25:1, 1:30:1, the first two settings work the best as shown in the following tables. From Table 4 and Fig. 4 we can see the F-Measures of 1:15:1, 1:20:1 1:25:1, and 1:30:1 are all the same. At this point, the values 15, 20, 25, and 30 for W5 are so large that the similarities based on titles and co-citations have been rendered inconsequential. To summarize, the contribution of similarity of titles and similarity based co-citations is small, but significant    Table 4.

While it is hard to come up with rigorous statistically significant proof of superior performance, Table 4 shows that inclusion of the Citonomy measure consistently results in a higher Fmeasure of at least 5%, with an average increase of 7.6%. Choosing relative weights W 1 W 2 15:1 \(fifth column\ults in the highest average F-Measure of 86% with a standard deviation of 10.3, which represents more than a 10% improvement over using VSM alone We get the best results for W 1 W 2 10:1, 15:1, 20:1 using W 3 W 5 W 6 1:5:1 with average F-Measure 86.6 85.9%, and 86% respectively \(other ratios not shown for lack of space\here are two possible reasons to explain why the optimal ratio is biased towards VSM  W 1   W 2 he first reason is that the vector space measure includes more complete information than Citonomy measure. This can be seen by the clustering result using either one alone - 75.9% versus 63.8% for this training data set. Another reason is that W 3 W 5 W 6 1:5:1 or 1:10:1 implies a high value for the Citonomy measure. To compensate for this, we need to increase the contribution of the VSM measure by assigning higher values for W 1 10, 15, or 20   Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 


 Fig. 5 F-Measure of clustering using combination of vector space and Citonomy with W 3 W 5 W 6 1:15:1   It is clear that the more weight we assign to vector space measure, the closer the result is to that of using vector space measure only; the more weight we assign to the Citonomy measure, the closer the result is that of using the Citonomy measure only. Fig. 5 confirms this by plotting the average F-Measure of different W 1 W 2 ratios with W 3 W 5 W 6 1:15:1 To test the weights we get from the training data we generated another set of corpora with same categories shown in Table 3 but with different papers and sizes.

Conclusion and future work  We have presented a new approach to document clustering in this paper that utilizes citation semantics as a similarity measure. Using experimental analysis we have demonstrated that the accuracy of clustering on incorporation of citation semantics is improved by 5-10  compared to using only the vector space measure An important consideration in machine learning applications is the cost benef it ratio. Ideally, the gain in performance should be worth the complexity of the approach. The non-optimized Citonomy pipeline used in this paper took about twice the time that the use of VSM alone takes. Though the use of Citonomy entails the use of several additional steps, these operate on a small subset of the data space, can be fully automated and several of the steps can be executed in parallel Therefore, running time can be potentially improved especially with removal of the combinatorial steps that were included for comparative validation. Further since this is an independent modular addition to the process of clustering, and essentially a pre-processing step for generating a pair-wise distance measure for documents with citations, it can be combined with essentially any clustering approach. Given that the resulting improvement is substantial and the extra cost is a linear addition that can potentially be minimized we feel the cost benefit ratio is high enough for this approach to be useful in practice While the degree of improvement may depend on the choice of documents to be clustered,  we speculate that the present report represents a lower bound and the contribution of Citonomy is likely to be higher in differentiating between subsets of closely related documents, in contrast to the coarse problem of journal-wise classification evaluated here. This is because Citonomy may be seen as an attempt to include semantics that stem from a consideration of spatial locality of terms, and from explicit links specificied by the authors of documents. Both these factors should lend themselves to a higher degree of discernment, as they go beyond considering only the independent occurrence of terms in a pure VSM approach. Further, the approach may be used as a distance measure not just for research papers, but essentially any documents that embed citations to other documents Future work may include the use of this approach on diverse types of document sets to establish its robustness. It may also be refined by using underlying domain ontologies for systematic recognition of matching terms, rather than performing only string matching as in the present work. Running time can also be improved by automating connections between the various steps and by judicious use of the values for the parameters that yield the best performance for the training sets   6.
