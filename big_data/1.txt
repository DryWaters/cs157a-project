Seyeon Yoo, Seojin Choi, Juyeop Kim, Heein Yoon, Yongsun Lee Jaehyouk Choi Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Ulsan, Korea To meet requirements of high data-rates, RF transceivers for a 5G standa\rd must have an ultra-wide bandwidth in a mm-wave band. A big challenge of a 5G transceiver is to generate ultra-low-PN \(phase noise LO to suppress integrated PN \(IPN that directly generates mm-band LO signals is not a good choice due to p\owerhungry frequency dividers and relatively poor PN. An mm-band LO generato\r cascading a GHz-range PLL and a frequency multiplier as shown in Fig. 19\.2.1, is an attractive solution. First, a GHz-range PLL can have a higher FOM tha\n a mmband PLL [1]. Second, the cascaded architecture is naturally able to sup\port the bands for 2G to 4G standards.

VCO and the target frequency are sufficiently close within the lock range 
L which is very narrow, especially, at high frequencies. To calibrate VCO over PVT, many frequency-tracking loops \(FTLs such as a replica-VCO, a TDC, and a counter VCO but they were not suitable for a mm-band ILFM. The sub-sampling FTL [2] used the voltage l\evels of the VCO outputs, momentarily sampled by injection pulses. However, fo\r the accurate sampling, the pulse width of the injection pulses must be very \narrow since the sampling occurs at the edges of the pulses. For a mm-band VCO,\ the pulse width must be less than 10ps, but these narrow pulses limit the in\jection strength and L In the mm-band ILFM of [3], the mixers and dividers consumed a lot of power. An envelope detector was used for another mm-band ILFM t\o enable the calibration operating at low frequencies [4], but it cannot d\etect VCO after the VCO is injection-locked and prevent PN degradation due to real\-time drifts of VCO  In this work, a PVT-robust, low-PN mm-band ILFM with an ultra-low-power \FTL is presented. By detecting distortions between the output phases of a qu\adrature VCO \(QVCO VCO deviates from the target frequency, the FTL can

The proposed FTL monitors the averages of phase deviat\ions rather than detects or samples the instantaneous values; thus, the FTL o\perates at a low frequency and thus requires low power without the use of high-f\requency circuits The proposed ILFM consists of a quadrature generator, a QVCO, pulse gene\rators PGs CFS the quadrature signals and generate the injection pulses

 computer.org   Pure play, \223born digital\224 financial and insurance technology start ups \(known as \223FinTech\224 and \223In sureTech\224\are transforming and disrupting their respective sectors The value proposition of these startups is in client-centricity. En gagement is much more effective than with traditional institutions because these businesses are de signed from the ground up to take full advantage of serving the cus tomer through digital means This disruption is hard for tra ditional organizations to battle because legacy systems and lum bering processes prevent them from delivering the value propo sition of client-centricity through digital data and end-to-end ho listic thinking around serving the customer. The CDO helps to develop the capabilities needed to battle these disruptors by bring ing scale, long-term relationships and market presence to the battle The CDO arms the organization with the digital agility to do battle with these disruptors Digital agility gives traditional institutions the opportunity to interface with their customers in a completely different way. The issue for both incumbents and innovators is ensuring that they move from analog to digital in a way that maintains quality and augments and streamlines the relationship. A digital solution al lows for experimentation and in novation at a faster clock speed than ever before. But digital plat forms require that data quality processes are in place. This is the basis of the value proposition\227a new or enhanced way of interact ing with the customer Even with the best technology there is a dependency on data, and data has a dependency on process and process has a dependency on governance. Although some CDOs choose to evangelize, they typically do so in less mature or ganizations in which business ex ecutives need to understand why this is so important. Without that understanding, the work of op erationalization cannot gain the needed attention and support and therefore will not gain traction. In cases where people are nodding their heads and saying, \223Yes, we understand, now how do we do it?,\224 the CDO role shifts to one of leading, or at least sponsoring governance. According to Gartner the CDO is typically responsible for \223the firm\222s enterprise-wide data and information strategy, gover nance, control, policy develop ment, and effective exploitation.\224 3  This makes sense once leadership is on board. Before that point, the CDO is more cheerleader than catalyst for implementation This kind of business-critical message must be communicated to the board, where key decisions are being made. The CDO can also help the CEO translate the mes sage into issues that might have a higher priority, such as organiza tional risk. In the case of risks and risk mitigation, the CDO will work with a chief risk officer \(CRO\o quantify the impact of data quality By identifying the issues with the  greatest urgency, the CDO can le verage in-flight initiatives to benefit multiple departments. By improv ing data quality for risk mitiga tion, the marketing organization can benefit as well. However, the importance of support from the CEO cannot be overstated. Der ek Strauss, CDO of Ameritrade observed that \223a CDO needs ex ecutive sponsorship to provide air cover.\224 2 The CEO not only needs to understand the importance of data to the business, but must also drive, from the top, the kind of cultural change that is needed for transformation Cybersecurity is a part of risk and data management, and these are board-level issues. Boards have to become more conversant in cy bersecurity because digital trans formation requires foundational cybersecurity, which is also depen dent on good governance of data Digital disruption will revolu tionize the whole relationship that companies have with customers it will change how business-tobusiness companies are aware of consumer needs. One of those paramount needs is trust, which is based on safeguarding and pro tecting data and assets. Safeguard ing customers\222 data and privacy means understanding what they need and not looking at data just for business needs. The CDO\222s overarching role in working with data managers in all departments helps maintain an enterprise-wide vision of monitoring data security including vulnerabilities resulting from the trend toward increasing partner and customer access to corporate data 67 The CDO and Digital Disruption The CDO Role Varies by Organization ITPro Different types of CDOs are need ed for different types of industries and maturity levels. For an organi zation early in the learning and ma turity curve, the job is more about education and awareness than get ting involved in day-to-day issues Others set up an infrastructure of decision-making bodies and rules and then move on, while others continue to lead those decisionmaking groups on an ongoing ba sis. Depending on the maturity of the organization and the demands of its industry\222s state of transforma tion \(for example, drastic change is impacting insurance and financial services more quickly than the in dustrial products vertical\, as well as the state of its infrastructure some transformations require  The CDO and Cybersecurity 


IT Pro 65 percent of CDO positions have been established just with in the past three years January/February 2017 Zions Bancorporation\222s Journey The core responsibility for data, data quality, and achieving greater business value from that data is common to all the manifestations of the CDO role According to Yang Lee of North eastern University, co-director for MIT\222s Chief Data Officer Re search Program, \223Traditionally data practices were led by middle managers, lacking executive col laboration. The emerging CDO practices are executive-led, ac countable, and sustainable.\224 4 His research shows that T 36 percent of CDOs report to a technology executive\227CIO or CTO Ultimately, the impact of the role will be measured by how well the CDO has transformed the organi zation through the use of data CIOs have traditionally been charged with developing and man aging the enterprise\222s information infrastructure. This is likely to remain the case, but according to Tamal Chakravorty, director of IT and Test for Ericsson Global Ser vices, the CDO needs to \223know how to find the required informa tion to fuel business growth.\224 5 How the role is expressed de pends on the company\222s matu rity level with respect to data management, as well as other factors such as size and industry sector. \(Highly regulated indus tries might lean more toward a governance model, whereas those in digital startups might focus on business value he interviews I conducted  with leaders knowledgeable  about the CDO role point to several observations It is important to align with and delineate clear responsibilities among related roles such as CIO and CTO The role is new. \223The role of CDO is in its early stages, much like the role of CMO was 20 years ago,\224 according to Rich Wendell CEO and CDO of Tellic, a firm specializing in pharma data sci ences as a service 64 percent of CDOs report to a business executive\227CEO chief operating officer \(COO CRO, or chief marketing officer CMO\ and Brandon Thomas, CDO of Zions Bancorporation, described the path  of his organization in getting con trol of data and processes. A cata lyst for launching his company\222s journey was the increased em phasis on data sources for \223stress tests\224 that financial institutions are now required to conduct based on the Dodd-Frank Act. The first  year of developing data governance  was foundational, setting standards  and policies. Zions appointed a re presentative for each of the 10 sub ject areas on the data governance  council. \223Interest and participa tion from the executive level was  high,\224 Thomas reported. \223Custo mers want companies to be re sponsive and have their informa tion available quickly.\224 In the course of developing its governance program, the team also looked at its architecture and evaluated such issues as whether it was keeping too much data in the data warehouse. Thomas em phasized that \223new technologies  were required in order to establish  data governance.\224 Among the new  tools was a dictionary for tagging  data that is much more user friendly and accessible to business  users than the previous solution  Thomas believes that this approach to data, maturity in governance and ability to effect cultural change provides a competitive advantage among peers. \(See a fu ture column for the full interview with Brandon Thomas 68  Changing Trends for CDOs The role is likely to remain fluid for a number of years major technology upgrades, such as costly enterprise resource plan ning replacements\, the organiza tion will need very different types of CDOs and CDO agendas  However, the core responsibility for data, data quality, and achiev ing greater business value from that data is common to all the manifes tations of the CDO role Data is the foundation of digi tal-born companies and essen tial for the transformation of traditional firms. The role of CDO will be pivotal to ensure the agility needed for future growth and success Forrester research has found that 54 percent of top performing organizations \(those with revenue growth greater than 10 percent have appointed CDOs versus 33 percent of low performers \(those with less than 4 percent revenue growth 6 Clearly, the CDO is a role that can provide significant value to the enterprise.
