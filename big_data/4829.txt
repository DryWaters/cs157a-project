Mining Efficacious Association Rules u nder Length-Decreasing Support Constraint  Lingwei Yan Department of Physics  Dalian Jiaotong University  Dalian, China Email: yanlingwei791@163.co m Weiguo Yi Software Institute  Dalian Jiaotong University  Dalian, China Email: jiekexun98@163.com   Abstract In mining association rules, Itemsets with highlength usually has lower support, but still have potential value To mine efficacious association rules under long-pattern, a new mining method of efficacious association rules is proposed under length-decreasing support constraint. Compare to other mining methods of association rules, the new method can mine 
more efficacious long-patterns and improve correlation between the antecedent and the consequent of the rules Keywords-association rules, correlation, length-decreasing support, match I   I NTRODUCTION  Data Mining is an active research area and one of the most popular approaches is discovering association rules. At present, the main research work about association rules includes efficiency analysis and correlation analysis. In the aspect of improving the efficiency of mining frequent itemsets, since R.Agrawal et al firstly introduced the association rules mining algorithm Apriori 1 many researches have done to make corresponding improvements according to the shortage of Apriori. FP-growth 
2 is an improved mining method which doesn’t generate candidate itemsets and has higher efficiency. But it has several disadvantages, such as the constructed FP-tree is too large the algorithm is too complex and the generated FP-tree doesn’t certainly fit into the main memory at a time Frequent closed itemsets mining algorithms, such as A-Close 3 CLOSET 4 CHARM 5 CLOSET 6 and FPClose 7  etc can reduce the redundant in the frequent patterns. The difficulty of frequent closed itemsets mining algorithms is to check whether itemsets are closed. Frequent closed itemsets mining algorithms generate a relatively smaller result set, so 
the algorithms have better expansibility and intelligibility Aim at the correlation of the generated rules. In order to make the rules more interesting, researchers have put forward a number of metrics of interestingness. In t h r ee types of metrics \(any-confidence, all-confidence, and bond are proposed to take place of support. In [9 n e w  m e tric o f  interestingness by using the information of classification is proposed. It gives a definition of interestingness: the support of rule is R times more than expected, or the confidence is R times more than expected. R is a constant specified by user In [1 n i m p r o v e m e n t i s m a d e  b a s e d o n  i n t e r e st i ngne ss i n  9   It t o ok  ac cou n t of g e n e ral i z a ti on  as w e ll as  specialization.

from the correlation of statistics and it is defined as P\(AB\/sqrt\(P\(A\P\(B It contains two important factors interest factor and support. In  a si gni fi ca nc e m e a s ur e for association is proposed by making use of 2  correlation test Its interestingness is defined as I S=P\(AB\/\(P\(A\P\(B  Because of the shortcomings of symmetric interestingness in  i n  13   Certainty P\(A\ P B\P\(A  B\ is proposed But it is anti-symmetric for the rules. In [1 a f r am e w or k  based on correlation is proposed. In this framework, it uses residual analysis to determine whether two items are 
independent. In [1 a  m e t h od bas e d on  l i n ea r  r e g r es s i on  an d  reverse authentication is presented to verify the correlation of the association rules. The method is based on the analysis of the correlation of the incident and verifies the generated rules through the selected time period. Therefore, how to select the size of time period will become an issue which is worth exploring The existing association rules mining algorithms are mostly studying on the efficiency and correlation analysis So it is hard to mine the long itemsets with low support Therefore, this paper did some corresponding analysis and proposed a length-decreasing support constraint to mine long itemets, then combined the effective association rules mining method to mine the association rules 
II  T HE B ASIC P ROBLEM  Given a transaction set D, mining association rules is to find the rules whose support and confidence are respectively larger than or equal to the minimum support threshold  minsup d minimum confidence threshold minconf  given by user. Therefore the association rule mining can be divided into two sub-problems as follows Find out all the itemsets, the support and confidence of which are larger than or equal to the minsup required by the customers. The itemsets with minsup are called frequent sets Set up association rules through frequent sets. Finding 
out all M’s non-empty subsets ms to each frequent set M Association rule m\(M-m can be obtained if s upport\(M\/support\(m minconf   s upport\(M\/support\(m is defined as the confidence of the rule m\(M-m where m is the antecedent of the rule and M m  is the consequent of the rule

The traditional association rules mining uses fixed minimum support threshold, thus it is unable to extract the frequent patterns with low support and it can’t reflect the changing of the minimum support of itemsets with different length. Besides, the traditional association rules mining adopts confidence threshold. Confidence can denote the probability that some itemset’ emergence will lead to others occurrence. But we notice that the confidence of association rule F=>E only considers the possibility of the case when E and F will occur simultaneously, without considering the possibility of the case when only E occur and the case whether E and F are correlated. Then many association rules obtained are ineffective III  LENGTH D ECREASING S UPPORT C ONSTRAIN T A  The Formula of Length-Decreasing Support According to the above-mentioned problems, this paper proposes a new length-decreasing support constraint to mine those long patterns which have low support but have potential value. Considering that the changing of the support can not only reflect the requirement of the minimum support for different long itemsets, but also can aim at datasets from different fields, the correlation coefficient is need to be capable of adjustment. Therefore, we define the calculation function as follows  2 2 a k+b+c 1-d k k<max_length f\(k s k max_length   1 where k is the length of the itemset a  b  c and d are coefficients a 0 b 0,0 c 1 d 0 s is a constant, and max_length denotes the maximum length. When the length of the itemset reaches the threshold given by experts, the corresponding minimum support will get the value s and no longer reduce. The maximum support threshold is f\(1 that is, it is the support threshold of itemsets whose length is 1 f\(1  2 a+b+c 1-d  1. The minimum support threshold is  f max_length   s 0. So the range of f\(k is s, f\(1    How to determine the parameters For example, when  f k is selected as the elliptic function curve, we can use the following value to compute the parameters 2 f 1\=c 1 d   2 max_ 2 2 f max_length\=c 1-d length s  3  The significance of the formula The formula contains linear function and elliptic function so as to do corresponding adjustment according to datasets from different fields. When the minimum support of frequent itemsets with different length decrease linearly, we can set the parameter c to zero; when meet elliptic diminishing relations, we can set both a and b to zero; when adjusting the minimum support curve with different length, we can respectively set the corresponding coefficients and obtain a combination of linear function and elliptic function. Fig. 1 shows the relationship between   f k and k   B  related properties Property 1 xy  then     s upport x support y   Property 2 Any itemset whose length is k satisfies f\(1 f\(k f\(k+1\, then f\(k\ is called a length-deceasing support constraint to the transaction database Property 3 Any itemset x whose length is k x satisfies x s upport\(x f\(k   then x is called a frequent itemset that satisfies a length-deceasing support constraint Property 4 The property of smallest valid extension SVE\: Assume itemset x and itemset y, their length are kx and y k respectively and xy  support\(x\f\(k x Then the necessary condition that y is a frequent itemset to  y f k is y k 1 f support\(x  In our problem, an itemsets can be frequent even if its subsets are infrequent. So the traditional way to mine association rules loses effectiveness in removing the candidate itemsets. Therefore, we mainly use Property 4 and the constant s to discard non-frequent itemsets IV  E FFICACIOUS A SSOCIATION R ULES  According to the problems discussed above, this paper considered the correlation between the antecedent and consequent of the generated rules, and then applied the framework of support-match to produce association rules by combining the existing the research results [16  M a tch i s  defined as follows Assume P\(A\ denotes the probability that A occurs, P\(B denotes the probability that B occurs, P\(AB\ denotes the probability that A and B occur simultaneously, P A B  denotes the probability that A and B occur simultaneously P A denotes the probability that A doesn’t occurs. Then we define the match of rule A B as match = \(the confidence of A B the confidence of A B that is P AB P A B match P\(A P A 4 To facilitate the understanding and calculation of the formula, the above formula can be transformed as Figure 1  the curve of minimum support function Length of itemsets linear  elliptic max-length 1 1  f\(1 f\(max-length

 P\(AB\\(A P\(B match P\(A 1-P\(A   5 We make the declaration that an itemset is unrelated to any other itemset when its support is 1, in which case we can overlook the match of this item set with other item sets Consequently, the probability for any itemset A’s occurrence is 0   PA 1. The range of match is [-1, 1  be ca use 0      PAB PA 1, 0  P AB P A 1. If match>0, we have    PAB PAPB  which proves that A and B are correlated. If match=1, we have       PAB PA PB   which indicates the case that A and B appear simultaneously Furthermore, we analyze the match theoretically. We define the concept of correlation P\(AB cor P\(A P\(B  6 1 P AB cor P A  P\(B   7 Hence, we have  1   match cor cor P B   We will get 11 cor cor  when cor equals to cor1 for the reason that 1P\(A 1 1P\(A cor cor    That is to say, A is unrelated to B when A is unrelated to B. Moreover 1 cor will be smaller than 1 while cor is bigger than 1. In other words, A is negatively correlated to B if A is positively correlated to B We can also find from the equation that the definition of match not only includes some correlation factors but also some  PB factors. Therefore, it can reveal the validity of rule A=>B with the definition of match V  E XPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND ANALYSIS  The paper uses the adult database to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Experiments are carried out on an IBMR52 notebook computer with 512M memory and 1.86GHz main frequency. The numerical attributes need to be discretized and we extract 24000 records from the database. The objective of the experiments is to test whether the algorithm can dig more effective long patterns and improve the correlation between the antecedent and consequent of the rules under long patterns Experimental settings are as follows The Formula of Length-Decreasing Support adopts 2 2 f k 1-d k  where 1 0.3 f   f max_length 0.5 max_length 5, and the minimum match 0.3. The experimental result is shown in Fig.2 When the number of records is 24,000, we extract two rules to do analysis: frequent itemset 14,11,12,19,23, rule 14=>11,12,19,23 support 0.39 match 0.34; frequent itemset 13,14,11,19,23, rule 13,14=>11,19,23 support 0.45 match 0.31. If we use a constant minimum support, the above itemsets whose length is 5 can’t be frequent, not to mention generating rules. But if we use a length-decreasing support constraint, they will meet the requirement and generate association rules. Therefore, the method proposed in this paper can not only mine the long patterns with potential value, but also can obtain efficacious association rules VI  C ONCLUSIONS  In order to discover the long patterns with potential value and remove the invalid short patterns in intensive database this paper proposes a new length-Decreasing Support Constraint and combines the framework of support-match to generate association rules. Theory and experimental results have proved that the proposed method can not only discover the long patterns with potential significance but also can generate efficacious association rules. We can believe that the proposed method has high theoretical and practical value in the study of intensive data or decision support fields R EFERENCES  1  R.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
