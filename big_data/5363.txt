It has long been recognized that the Credit scheduler favors CPU-bound applications while for the latency-sensitive workloads such as those related to stream-based audio/video services its performance is far from satisfactory In this paper we present an improved Credit scheduler in Xen to facilitate such tasks on multicore platforms To this end we improve the Credit scheduler from three perspectives First given the identiìed problem we minimize the system response time by load balancing the virtual CPUs with

problem by monitoring the received network packets in the driver domain and deliberately preventing it from being prematurely preempted during the packet delivery to further reduce and stabilize the I/O latency Finally we optimize the frequency of CPU switch by utilizing time-variant slice instead of the existing long time-invariant one to adapt to the dynamic uctuation of the number of virtual CPUs in the run queue associated with each physical CPU Our empirical studies show that the proposed improvement can signiìcantly improve the performance of the Credit scheduler for scheduling the I/O latency-sensitive applications 
I I NTRODUCTION Xen virtualization is being widely adopted by many enterprises at present to underpin their business-oriented services due to its exibility and efìciency in resource management and provision With Xen virtualization one can easily achieve quick resource re-allocation ideal fault isolation and increased exibility which are all critical factors to the success of service delivery Although the beneìts of Xen are obvious its complexity and overhead present additional challenges to adversely effect the overall performance to some applications One typical example

is the I/O-intensive applications with latency sensitivity such as those related to stream-based audio/video services In general these applications do not require a great amount of CPU time rather they are very sensitive to latency This observation indicates that resource multiplexing and scheduling among virtual machines in Xen is still poorly understood or at least not fully studied in some regards In this paper we study this VM scheduling problem in Xen by impro ving its def ault

using a credit system to fairly share processor resources while minimizing the wasted CPU cycles Hence it is very intuitive for users to think about CPU allocations which should be exible enough to achieve global load balancing of virtual CPUs VCPUs across physical CPUs PCPUs on SMP hosts in order to achieve high performance for CPU-bound tasks Although the Credit scheduler is efìcient to computationintensive workloads it could incur a certain amount of latency for I/O-intensive tasks due to the mismatched or inefìcient designs in its VCPU allocation strategies data distribution mechanisms and time slice calculations For example VCPUs could be frequently switched in dealing with I/O packet distribution if a large amount of blocked I/O operations exist 
including those in Dom0 which is also subjected to the same scheduling algorithm as other guest domains This would adversely impact the overall system performance as the control domain  
 back-ends the communication directly with I/O devices to complete all the I/O requests in the system On the other hand the xed time slice the Credit scheduler algorithm assigns to each PCPU may also potentially cause frequent switching cache miss or low hit rate and sporadic task starvation We make contributions to improving the Credit scheduler with enhanced performance to the I/O latency-sensitive applications First we minimize the system response time by balancing the I/O intensive tasks of the VCPUs with BOOST

II B ACKGROUND K NOWLEDGE Xen virtualization is a layer of software termed VMM or in Xen parlance that abstracts the underlying hardware resources of a single physical server into multiple instances of virtual machines VMs aka in Xen co-existing and co-executing simultaneously Domain as the VM presents the virtualized resources such as CPUs physical memory network connections and block devices as an illusion of a real machine to the overlying guest OS and applications According to Xen the domains in the same physical machine are not in the same functional class Dom0 as a privileged domain i.e control domain is created during the boot time to take the responsibility for hosting the application-level management software including the control of other domains termed DomUs in Xen e.g domain creation domain termination In particular Dom0 can function as a driver domain if it hosts the device drivers and performs I/O operations on behalf of the DomUs 1  In contrast DomUs are unprivileged guest domains which as discussed present the virtualized resources to the overlying guest OS and applications They cannot directly access the physical hardware on the machine Rather to accomplish an I/O operation i.e network and disk accesses DomUs have to cooperate with Dom0 via two ring buffers one for packet transmission and the other for packet reception The Credit scheduler is a fair share algorithm based on the proportional scheduling Each domain is assigned a value which is determined by the deìned for the domain The credit value represents the CPU share that the domain is expected to have Therefore the domains should have an equal fraction of processor resources if each domain is given the same number of credits The credits of the running domains as the cost paid for the processor resources are deducted periodically 100 credits for every 10ms via scheduler interrupts but a domain that runs for less than 10ms will not have any credits debited Whenever its credit value is negative the domain is in OVER priority otherwise in UNDER priority Every so often 30ms a system-wide accounting thread recomputes the credits earned by each running domain according to its weight By default Xen allocates only one VCPU to each domain when the domain is created 2  and it contains general information related to scheduling and event channels To support the numerous processes in the guest OS and applications the VCPUs will be scheduled among the PCPUs which is 1 Current Xen-based systems usually employ the Fig 1 The organization of the Credit scheduler IDLE state is not illustrated here achieved by maintaining a local ready VCPU domain queue i.e run queue for each PCPU The queue is periodically accounting period 30ms sorted in such a way that VCUPs with UNDER priority i.e UNDER VCPUs will always run ahead of VCPUs with OVER priority i.e OVER VCPUs and the ordering within each priority is round-robin The system always schedules the VCPU to run which is at the head of the queue The selected VCPU will receive 30ms before being preempted to run another VCPU VCPUs in OVER priority cannot be scheduled unless there is no UNDER VCPUs in the run queue This implies a domain cannot use more than its fair share of the processor resources unless the processor\(s would otherwise have been idle When a processor is idle or the processorês run queue has no more UNDER VCPUs it would check other processors to nd any eligible VCPUs to run on this processor achieving the global load balancing However the original Credit algorithm is merely amenable to the compute-intensive workloads and biased against the I/Olatency sensitive applications To address this problem and minimize the latency of I/O event handling a boost mechanism is introduced into the Credit scheduler by adding a new priority BOOST to the system so that a VCPU with BOOST priority i.e BOOST VCPU is allowed to preempt a running UNDER VCPU The current Credit scheduler boosts the priority of the blocked VCPU in UNDER to BOOST after it is woke up by receiving an event over its event channel The woke-up VCPU preempts the running VCPU at once rather than entering the run queue to compete with other domains As a consequence the response time of I/O-intensive tasks is reduced As an illustrative example Fig 1 shows the organization of the Credit scheduler where four Domains are co-located in the same machine to multiplex the underlying physical resources for effective utilization III P ERFORMANCE A NALYSIS OF X EN C REDIT S CHEDULER In this section we identify several not yet fully-studied sources of performance aws in the current Credit scheduler that could slowdown the I/O-latency sensitive applications

Simultaneous Multi-Boosting Premature Preemption Fixed Time Slice 1 Simultaneous Multi-Boosting SMB 2 Fixed Time Slice FTS A Load Balancing of BOOST Domains LB 
We refer to them as   and  SMB refers to the phenomenon that multiple domains could be boosted at the same time This phenomenon is quite often observed in I/Ointensive applications due to Xenês split driver model as we discussed The SMB problem has been recognized in the virtualizations 6 Ho we v er  there are quite fe w research on this problem in the context of multicore platforms Although the Credit scheduler is merited for its global load balancing it does not distinguish the states of the VCPUs to balance the loads among the multiple PCPUs As a consequence it could be happened that for some PCPUs there are more BOOST VCPUs waiting in the queue to be scheduled than the others which results in the imbalance of the BOOST VCPUs as shown in Fig 2 where the uneven distribution of the BOOST VCPUs for two I/O intensive benchmarks ping and zip&gzip on a quad-core platform with 32 test domains excluding Dom0 are shown In this paper we intend to make a contribution on this problem for the multicore platforms The Credit algorithm is by nature a sort of round-robin algorithm a xed time slice of 30ms is designed independent of the number of the VCPUs as well as their states to ensure the fairness among the domains However this may result in two problems when the number of VCPUs in the run queue is small the xed time slice will cause frequent switches between the VCPUs in the run queue increasing the system overhead On the contrary when the number of VCPUs is large the xed time slice will increase the response time of those VCPUs at the tail of the queue In theory for a particular time interval the longer the time slice is the fewer switch times and the shorter average turnaround of the scheduling are However for a latency-sensitive task its response time is closely related to the number of tasks waiting in the run queue Therefore the xed time slice might not be sufìciently adequate and dynamic time slice adapting to the number of VCPUs waiting in the run queue is probably desired On the other hand as the number of CPUs in the same physical machine is constantly increased on a large-scale The number of VCPUs associated with each PCPU would be steadily decreased for more efìcient consolidation Therefore the Credit scheduling algorithms need to consider and optimize the case where the run queue of PCPU has less VCPUs Again the xed time slice is also not adequate IV E NHANCED S CHEDULER D ESIGN AND I MPLEMENTATION Given the description of the identiìed aws in Credit scheduler in this section we present the design and implementation of our enhanced scheduler to address these issues As we showed in the last section the current scheduler could cause the SMB problem which potentially leads to the uneven distribution of BOOST domains among the PCPUs Although Credit scheduler can achieves global load balancing it little effect on the balance of the BOOST domains making the system less responsive as a whole To address this problem we perform a load balance for the BOOST VCPUs across all the PCPUs in the machine to improve the response speeds of the VCPUs Our load balancing algorithm is shown as follows After a BOOST domain is woke up and inserted into a run queue the hypervisor will tickle the scheduler to make a scheduling for the PCPU associated with that queue However before this action is performed we rst run a simple load balancing algorithm Checks whether or not the current running VCPU on the corresponding PCPU is BOOST If yes selects the target PCPU based on some criteria where VCPUs can migrate ties are broken arbitrarily However if the selected target and source PCPU are the same then exits Otherwise inserts the VCPU into the run queue of the target PCPU Otherwise if the current running VCPU is not BOOST triggers the PCPU scheduling as usual and then exits

In a multicore system the target PCPU is selected according to the following criteria Searches a free PCPU in accordance with the order of the same core the same socket different sockets If found then returns the PCPU number Searches the PCPU not running a BOOST VCPU in accordance with the order of the same core the same socket different sockets If found then returns the PCPU number Finds out the PCPU whose run queue includes the least BOOST VCPUs then returns the PCPU number The rationale behind these criteria is the spatial locality of the computations For example if two PCPU share the same core they can also share the same local cache This section introduces our design and implementation of the algorithm to prevent the driver domain from being prematurely scheduled out i.e the PP problem in the process of the network packet dispatches The basic idea of this algorithm is straightforward When there are multiple pending packets for dispatching the driver domain will inform the underlying hypervisor of this fact which as a response will not tickle the scheduler until the driver domain dispatches all these packets and yields The core data structure of this algorithm is a of size equal to the number of the PCPUs in the platform The vector is created in the hypervisor at the boot time and then shared with the driver domain Each bit represents a PCPU and the bit value is set by the driver domain and used by the hypervisor The value of indicates the corresponding PCPU is dispatching packets while the value of denotes that the PCPU is not doing such work The algorithm runs inside the driver domain whenever a packet is arriving or has been dispatched to the target guest Depending on whether or not the number of I/O virtual interrupts in the event channel is greater than one the algorithm notiìes the hypervisor by setting or clearing the corresponding bit in the vector via a hypercall When the scheduler is tickled by the hypervisor it rst examines the value of the bit that corresponds to the PCPU running the domain driver If the value has been set to  then scheduling on the corresponding PCPU is disabled which means the driver domain cannot be preempted while dispatching packets Otherwise scheduling is performed as usual and the driver domain could be preempted Our algorithm is simple yet efìcient to achieve the goal as only one bit vector is shared between the driver domain and the hypervisor and the shared bit vector is only updated by the domain driver incurring no synchronization cost As discussed in Credit scheduler the xed time slice of 30ms is used independent of the states of VCPU BOOST or UNDER The slice for the BOOST VCPU is divided into two phases In the rst phase the VCPU will run under the BOOST priority for 10ms and then switch down to the UNDER priority entering the second phase The time length of VCPU in the BOOST state is essential to the scheduling If this length is too long other VCPUs with the same priority i.e BOOST could be over delayed increasing the I/O response time Otherwise if it is too short the BOOST VCPU could not get sufìcient time to execute before being preempted by other BOOST VCPUs balancing out the beneìts of BOOST state With these factors in mind to strike a balance between the average turnaround time of the system and the mean response time of each individual I/O-sensitive application we propose dynamic time slice that would be adjusted according to the number of VCPUs in the corresponding run queues Depending on the state the time slice after this optimization is deìned on the selected VCPU by the conducting the following steps Changing the length of its rst BOOST phase as 2ms approximately amounting to the time slice for the I/O processes running on BOOST VCPUs inserting it into the run queue and then changing its priority into UNDER As a consequence the selected VCPU would be located before all the UNDER VCPUs and after all the BOOST VCPU in the queue Clearly if there is no more BOOST VCPUs in the queue the just inserted VCPU can be continued to schedule for execution Calculating the time slice for the UNDER VCPU based on the number of UNDER VCPUs in the queue according to the following formula if if 1 here is the default length of the run queue which is typically set to 4 after system boot-ups refers to the number of UNDER VCPUs in the queue when the time slice is calculated The rationale behind this deìnition is twofold First for the BOOST phase I/O processes in general could be frequently blocked yielding the VCPUs As a result the VCPUs usually do not need longer time slices On the other hand if there are other applications other than the blocked I/O processes running on the same BOOST VCPU those applications will continue to run at BOOST level till the end of the time slice As a result it would delay the scheduling of other BOOST VCPUs which is not desired This also requires a small time slice for the BOOST VCPUs Second for the UNDER phase we distinguish two cases On one hand due to the VCPU afìnity the number of the UNDER VCPUs in the queue remains small and largely unchanged If there are a quite few UNDER VCPUs the time slice can be increased accordingly to minimize the scheduling overhead As discussed previously

in reality the number of UNDER VCPUs associated with a PCPU is usually small and the improved algorithm should optimize this common case On the other hand the increased time slice should not be varied in a wide range as otherwise it could compromise the fairness the goal of the Credit scheduler Therefore in our deìnition we use two xed values 30ms and 60ms to optimize the scheduler for the short run queues while maintaining the fairness goal Given this deìnition the algorithm for dynamic time slice is straightforward First a color attribute is added to the VCPUês data structure which is set to red when the VCPU is inserted into the run queue and to black when it is fetched out for recalculating the time slice Based on this attribute the algorithm then performs the following 1 Checking the selected VCPU state If it is in BOOST state then the time slice is set to ms directly 2 Otherwise if the selected VCPU is not in BOOST state then checking the color of the VCPU If it is black the time slice will be set to a value calculated according to Eq 1 Otherwise if it is red indicating the time slice calculated previously has expired and the algorithm needs to recalculate it 3 Locking the entire run queue counting the VCPUs and recalculating the time slice according to Eq 1 then setting all VCPUs to black and storing the time slices into each PCPUês local structures 4 Setting the time slice of the forthcoming VCPU to the just calculated value and switching off it The three proposed algorithms are independent of each other They are designed for different problems and invoked at different time during the execution Currently the LB algorithm for load balancing the BOOST VCPUs is invoked by the hypervisor after a BOOST VCPU is inserted into a queue and before the scheduler is tickled This is reasonable under the assumption that each BOOST VCPU has an equal opportunity to preempt the running VCPU implying that the driver domain can be scheduled out at any time However this assumption is not always true when considering the effects of the prevention algorithm PPP since the driver domain cannot be preempted arbitrarily In this situation the prevention algorithm should be designed in conjunction with the load balancing algorithm for further performance improvements More speciìcally according to the original scheduler after an VCPU is boosted it likely preempts the running driver domain even though it has pending packets However in our implementation this premature preemption is temporarily forbidden and a new PCPU has to be selected for this new woke-up BOOST VCPU with the stated load balancing in mind Therefore the performance can be improved In contrast to LB and PPP the DTS algorithm is relatively isolated to be completely implemented in the Credit scheduler and invoked when a VCPU is scheduled Although our algorithm to SMB is effective to improve the latency-sensitive applications as we will show in the empirical studies in the next section there is still some room left unexplored for further improvements For example we did not consider the temporal locality and queue features other than the number of BOOST VCPUs in the current PCPU selection criteria Like the proposed LB algorithm the prevention algorithm can also be improved as well First we can use a vector instead of a bit vector to track the number of pending packets in the driver domain The advantage of using a counter vector is that the values of the elements can be increased or decreased on the y with respects to the packet arriving at or leaving from the driver domain saving the work each time to check the event channels However a problem with this improvement is the size of the counter the could be a potential solution to this problem for further study Second as a side effect the prevention algorithm could pin down the driver domain to the PCPU if it has a large number of pending packets we therefore need new optimizations on both the scheduling algorithms and the network I/O mechanisms running in due course to address this problem the current dynamic time slice may not sufìce but a large time slice may also have negative effects on the fairness of the Credit algorithm especially for compute-intensive applications on single-processor platforms Since the time slice for each selected VCPU depending its state is different the organization of the run queues may have impact on the performance of the DTS algorithm We can organize all the logic CPUs in a red-black tree rather than the linked list queue which could be more efìcient It is not necessary to assign a run queue of VCPU for each PCPU rather we can assign a red-black tree for each group to organize and maintain the VCPUs V P ERFORMANCE E VALUATIONS In this section we evaluate our algorithms via intensive empirical studies After introducing the experimental setup we assess each proposed optimization by measuring the response times of a latency-sensitive application Our numerical results show that the proposed optimizations can remarkably improve the performance of the latency-sensitive tasks Our experimental setup includes two physical machines and 32 virtual machines excluding the driver domain The two physical machines are connected by a 100 Mbps Ethernet and each of them is conìgured according to Table I All the virtual machines are installed on one physical machine and managed by Xen-3.4.2 while the other one as a remote machine communicates with those virtual machines We conìgure each domain based on Table II and use CentOS 5.2 as the guest OS in the driver domain i.e Dom0 in our experiments As the major goal of this research is to optimize the latency-sensitive applications by reducing the response

TABLE I Hardware conìguration and a basic search BS programs as our benchmarks since these programs are usually adopted for this purpose in the literature Concretely a remote system is used to send pings to the guest who only acknowledges the receipt of the ping packets without doing any other computations We use this benchmark to measure the network latency whereby to evaluate our proposed algorithms To evaluate the LB optimization on the BOOST domains we rst create guest domains in this experiment which are evenly divided into two groups each with virtual machines We then allow each machine in the second group to ping a machine in the rst group every second in order to generate a large amount of BOOST VCPUs We then measure each ping response time The comparison results before and after the improvement are shown in Fig 3 It is clear that the packet response time is not only dramatically reduced after the optimization but also relatively stable between each ping operation This demonstrates the beneìts of the load balancing among the BOOST domains This phenomenon is not difìcult to understand as during the scheduling the BOOST VCPUs are organized to wait in the run queue which would cause the VCPUs in the front of the queue to have more opportunities to get scheduled quickly and thus shorten the ping response time but for the VCPUs in the rear of the queue they would get scheduled slowly lengthening the ping response time and resulting in the unstableness In contrast after the improvements with the load balancing BOOST VCPUs are distributed evenly into each PCPUês run queue so that in average the number of BOOST VCPUs in each run queue is decreased accordingly As a result even a BOOST VCPU at the backend of the run queue would not be waiting too long Therefore the ping response time is uctuated little approximately around ms which is relatively stable compared with the before improvement Fig 3 The runtime of ping program before and after being improved As the system performance will be degraded if the backend driver is frequently switched off in the process of dispatching network packets the number of domains involved in this experiment should be increased accordingly so that the advantages of this optimization would be prominently displayed To this end we still create 20 virtual machines and another machine to ping these 20 virtual machines In this way a large number of the ping packets have to be dispatched by the backend dispatcher to multiple blocked VCPUs We measure the distribution of the response time of the rst 1000 ping requests as the metric to evaluate the optimization Fig 4 shows the comparison results on the distribution before and after the improvements From this gure we can clearly see that a large percentage of the response time before the improvement falls into the interval greater than ms whereas for the improved results it is less than ms demonstrating the effectiveness of our improvement to the latency-sensitive applications The results are straightforward before the improvement due to the extensive communications between the number of guest domains it is highly likely that the VCPUs allocated to the back-end driver domain would be preempted by the VCPUs that just woke up in other domains Consequently it would delay to wake up some other VCPUs to dispatch the ping packets This is evidenced by the hash bars in Fig 4 where the ping response time that is greater than ms occupies a large percentage close to 47 of the total results With the PPP optimization the VCPUs in the back-end driver domain are prevented from being switched off during the packet dispatching As a result the ping response time after improved is less than ms in a large part about 75 as shown by the dotted bars in Fig 4 Although the DTS algorithm is designed to optimize the response time of each individual latency-sensitive task when the run queue length is short it may also effect the overall performance of other tasks as a whole especially the computeintensive tasks To evaluate the algorithm in a comprehensive

Fig 4 The ping time distribution before and after the improvement Fig 5 Mean response time before and after DTS improvement way in the following set of experiments we focus on the evaluations of its impact on both the mean response time of the latency-sensitive applications and the average turnaround time of the system as well Our results show that with the dynamic time slice both the mean response time and the average turnaround time can be more or less improved In this experiment we measure the mean response time of VCPUS by adopting the BS benchmark To this end we rst conìgure the measured machine as a search server which includes four guest OSes and observe the responses to the search requests in different intensities from these guest OSes We then use the average of the response time over the four guest OSes as a metric to evaluate the DTS algorithm As shown in Fig 5 the mean response time after the DTS improvement is gradually reduced compared to when the improvement is not employed This observation is not surprisingly As the search service is deployed in the virtual machines it could happen that there are multiple processes running on the same VCPU When the VCPU is boosted in addition to the I/O processes other compute-intensive processes would enable the BOOST VCPU to execute a long time which is not necessary After the improvements the time slice is adjusted to 2ms only allowing the I/O processes to have the BOOST VCPUs while others having the UNDER VCPUs In the gure when the request intensities are low the mean response time before and after the improvements is almost the same This is because in this case there are not that many BOOST VCPUs waiting in the queue However with the intensity growth the results after the improvements is clearly better than those before improved because a large number of BOOST VCPU could be produced as a result of the ever-increasing requests In Credit scheduler the time slice for the UNDER VCPUs is set to 30ms whereas in the improved algorithm we adjust this value for the UNDER VCPUs based on their queue lengths and optimize the case when such a queue length is less than a default value In the measurements to avoid the impact of the multicore architectures on the scheduling algorithm we deliberately conduct the experiment on a single PCPU by creating different a number of guest OSes which could further result in a different number of VCPUs for the same PCPU Additionally we deploy  on each gust OS and adopt its primesum 3 as the benchmark to measure the CPU performance Table III shows the compared average turnaround times between the after-improved and the before-improved when the number of VCPUs in the run queue is varied from 1 to 8 Given the default queue length of 4 we can observe that the turnaround times after the improvements are obviously lower than those before the improvements and the difference between them is gradually increased with respects to the execution time as shown in Fig 6 The reason is that when the number of UNDER VCPUs is less than the default value the algorithm sets the time slice by 60ms in order to minimize the scheduling overhead However when the queue length of the UNDER VCPUs is greater than the default value both the improved and unimproved algorithms have the same time slice of 30ms As a result they exhibit approximately the same turnaround time These results demonstrate that when the number of UNDER VCPUs in the queue is small increasing the time slice can clearly improve the system performance Fig 6 Difference of the average turnaround time between beforeimproved and after-improved the default VCPU queue length is

in Proceedings of the 1995 ACM SIGMETRICS Joint International Conference on Measurement and Modeling of Computer Systems various software and hardware con\223gurations leading us to the recommendation that prefetching algorithms be applied to any of the proposed cache con\223gurations in order to increase the hit rate and decrease the system power consumption In addition we have examined the effects of a likely future expansion of FTP server size on the EROS system and found a slight increase in hit rate in addition to the expected substantial increase in power consumption Although the bene\223t of prefetching diminishes as cache sizes become larger we continue to suggest the use of prefetching as a mechanism for offsetting the cost of powering additional hardware The cost of expanding the FTP server farm to 200TB would contain not only a signi\223cant up-front investment about 8 million dollars but an increasing power draw Our experimental results Table II demonstrate that the EROS system can maintain the same level of performance with 31.78 of power savings by using our proposed popularity-based and user-speci\223c prefetching algorithms compared to doubling the size of its FTP server farm Therefore we suggest administrators of large scale massive storage systems fully explore all possible software optimizations before physically expanding the existing system
