node consists of a two-layered laser range sensor LRS that detects the positions of waists and knees of people From the laser images of the people heuristic-rule-based and global-nearestneighbor GNN\ased data association can identify a large number of people in crowded environments The identified people are tracked via a model-based tracker the interacting multiple model IMM estimator is applied to track people moving randomly and flexibly such as walking running going/stopping suddenly and turning suddenly Simulation and experimental results validate our people tracking method Index Terms People tracking Laser range sensor 
Interacting multiple model estimator Data association I I NTRODUCTION The tracking  i.e  estimation of motion of multiinteracting people is an important issue for surveillance security service robotics intelligent transport system and many other applications There has been much interest in the use of stereo vision or laser range sensors LRSs In this paper we focus on laser-based tracking Compared with vision-based tracking systems laserbased tracking systems are insensitive to lighting conditions and require less data processing time Thus a number of laser 
based tracking systems have been developed in the past years 1\22610  I n sp ar se en v i r o n m en t s l ase r b ase d t r ac k i n g sy st em s can provide good accuracy however the tracking accuracy reduces in cluttered and crowded environments where a lot of interactions and occlusions of multiple people occur To address with this problem multiple people tracking based on Bayesian filters such as the Kalman filter and the Particle filter has been achieved 5\22610  I n ad d i t i o n  d at a asso ci at i o n one-to-one matching of tracked people and laser measurements such as the joint probabilistic data association filter JPDAF and the multiple hypothesis tracker MHT 14 
15 18  h as b ee n i m p l em en t ed f o r r el i ab l e t r ac k i n g  H o w ev er  the limitations of conventional laser-based people tracking systems are inherent and evident Most laser-based tracking systems use a laser scanning in a single plane and apply a leg tracking method where people are represented by the states of their two legs namely a single augmented state or a high-level track in which two low-level leg tracks are associated This approach makes it difficult to detect multiple people accurately in crowded environments Therefore track lost often occurs A typical solution to manage with this problem is to simultaneously detect different 
body parts of a person such as legs and torso using multilayered LRS 11\22613  M o r eo v er  b y al l o ca t i n g m u l t i LR Ss as sensor nodes at different positions in an environment we can reduce occlusions of people in cluttered environments and improve the tracking performance 4 6 7  Most conventional laser-based tracking systems based on Bayesian filter are built under the assumption that people walk at almost constant speed Therefore when people move randomly and flexibly such as walking running going or stopping suddenly and turning suddenly the tracking performance significantly deteriorates People typically move 
and act under the constraints of an environment making human behavior strongly dependent on the location For randomly moving people a single model constant velocity model is insufficient to represent the people\222s motion A multi-model based approach in which different models run in parallel and describe different aspects of the people\222s behavior is an effective technique to track randomly moving people in the aerospace field one of the typical multi-model based approaches to track maneuvering targets is the interacting multiple model IMM estimator 16 17  This paper presents a laser-based tracking system for 
randomly moving people in a crowded environment Multiple two-layered LRSs are allocated at different positions in the environment This detects different body parts of people simultaneously thus allowing a robust detection of people The IMM based tracking enables tracking randomly moving people This paper is organized as follows Section II presents an overview of our experimental system Sections III and IV 


present our tracking method Section V describes simulation and experiment to evaluate the tracking method followed by our conclusions II E XPERIMENTAL S YSTEM Figure 1 shows our experimental sensor node It consists of two LRSs LRS H and LRS L  Each LRS captures distance samples by scanning a single laser beam in a horizontal plane Therefore we construct a two-layered LRS by setting two LRSs at different heights LRS H detects people\222s waists and LRS L detects their knees The view angle of the LRS is 180 deg In our experiment we allocate two sensor nodes in the environment Figure 2 shows the sequence of people detection and tracking In each sensor node we extract the distance samples laser measurements related to people on the basis of the background subtraction method from the laser images from LRS H and LRS L  The distance samples obtained from the same object have the same values while those obtained from different objects are significantly different Thus the distance samples are clustered by checking the gap between two adjacent samples Based on the sample clustering we group the laser measurements and obtain the representative point of each group We perform the clustering individually using each LRS The distance samples filtered in each sensor nodes are collected into a computer Based on the distance samples we detect people and identify them via the global-nearestneighboring GNN\-based data association 18  Th e identified people are tracked based on the IMM estimator 16 17  III P EOPLE T RACKING A Interacting Multiple Model IMM Estimator Based Tracking We classify person motion into the following three patterns LRS H LRS L Figure 1 Experimental sensor node  LRS H Background subtraction and grouping People detection Tracking Sensor node 1 Background subtraction and grouping Sensor node 2 LRS L LRS H LRS L Data association Figure 2 Sequence of people detection and tracking a Constant velocity model Model 1 Person moves at almost constant speed b Sudden acceleration/deceleration model Model 2 Person suddenly increases/decreases the speed and turns c Stop model Model 3 Person stops Motion equation of the three models is given by Eqs A.1 and A.2 in Appendix We represent the motion equation of the n th model where n  1 2 3 by the following vector form  11 n t n t nn t vxfx 1 where Tnnnnnn vyx  x   nn yx is the person\222s position in a global coordinate frame and n is the moving direction of the person n v and n are the linear and turning velocities of the person respectively Tnnn v  v is the disturbance which is assumed to be zero mean and having white noise sequence with the variance diag nn v n qq Q  For the Models 1 and 3 we set 1 v q  1 q  3 v q  and 3 q at small values for the Model 2 we select larger 2 v q and 2 q than 1 v q and 1 q  In our experiments shown in Section V we set their variance at srad1.0,/sm1.0diag 42421 Q  srad100,/sm50diag 42422 Q  and srad1.0,/sm1.0diag 42423 Q  The LRS measurements give the waist knee positions of the person in the global coordinate frame by T yx zz  z  The measurement model related to both LRS H and LRS L is t n tt zHxz 2 where 00010 00001 H  z is the measurement noise which is assumed to be zero 


mean and having noise sequence with the variance R  In our experiments shown in Section V we set the variance at m01.0,m01.0diag 22 R  Based on Eqs 1 and 2 we track the person via the IMM estimator 16 17  To t r ac k m u l t i p l e p eo p l e as sh o w n i n Fig 3 a validation region is set around the predicted position of each tracked person The measurement inside the validation region is considered to come from the tracked person and it is applied to the track update with an IMM estimator As in Fig 3 a and c in crowded environments multiple measurements exist inside a validation region multiple tracked people also compete for measurements To achieve the reliable data association matching of tracked people and measurements we apply GNN 18 19  i n w h i ch a co st matrix based on the laser measurements distance samples related to the people\222s waists and knees can be minimized The methods of setting the validation region and cost matrix are detailed in Section IV In Fig 3 b person 1 matched with the waist measurement taken by LRS H is updated by the waist measurement The person 2 that is not matched with any waist measurement is updated by the knee measurements taken by LRS L  In Fig 3\(b and d person 1 matched with both the waist and knee measurements is updated using only the waist measurement B Track Management Moving people always appear in and disappear from the sensing area of the LRS They also meet interaction and occlusion In order to handle such conditions we implement a track management system based on the following rules a Track initiation  As shown in Fig 3 a and d the measurements that are not matched with any tracked people are considered to come from new people or false alarms which disappear soon Therefore we tentatively initiate tracking of the measurements with the IMM estimator If the measurements are always visible in more than N 1 seconds they are considered to come from new people and the tracking is continued If the measurements disappear within N 1 seconds they are considered to be the false alarms and the tentative tracking is terminated b Track termination  When the tracked people exit the sensing area of the LRS or they meet occlusion no measurements exist within their validation regions If no measurements arise from the temporal occlusion the measurements appear again We thus predict the positions of the tracked people with the IMM estimator If the measurements appear again within N 2 seconds we proceed with the tracking of objects Otherwise we terminate the tracking In our simulation and experiment described in Section V we set N 1  0.7 and N 2 1.2 by trial and error Person 1 Person 2 Waist measurement  Person 1 Person 2 a Tracked people and b Data association with waist measurements waist measurements Person 1 Person 2 Knee measurement Person 1 Person 2 c Tracked people and d Data association with knee measurements knee measurements Figure 3 Data association of tracked people and laser measurements The closed circles and open diamonds indicate the tracked people and the measurements respectively The dashed lines in a and c indicate the validation region The red lines in b and d indicate the result of data association IV D ATA A SSOCIATION A Setting of Validation Region In this subsection we describe the method of setting the validation region Based on the n th motion model where n  1 2 3 of the person the IMM estimator predicts the position of the tracked person by  n t n n t n t f P xH xH 3 where 3 1 m m t mnn t c xx  and 3 1 1 1 m m t mn m t mn mn T T c  T mn is the probability that the m th model jumps into the n th model where m  1 2 3 and n  1 2 3 m t x and m t 1 are the state estimate and posterior probability of the m th model As shown in Fig 4 three circular regions with constant radius r are set around the predicted positions 1 t P  2 t P  and 3 t P  of the tracked person and their union is set as the validation region for the data association In the simulation and experiment in Section V we set the radius at r  0.55 m for LRS H and r  0.5 m for LRS L

B Experimental Result of Eleven People Tracking We conducted experiments of tracking eleven people in a hall environment 8 m 6 m as shown in Fig 5 The people move randomly sudden stop sudden going and sudden turning Two sensor nodes are set in the environment a fisheye camera is equipped with the sensor node 1 to evaluate the tracking performance We tracked the people in 45.3 seconds 453 scans Figure 6 shows the tracking result In the experiment the rate of the people detection was 95.6 the number of the track lost was just one while misidentification never occurred VI C ONCLUSIONS This paper presented a laser-based people tracking system for randomly moving people in crowded environments Multiple two-layered LRSs allocated at different positions in the environments allowed reliable detection of people The IMM-based tracking algorithm enabled the system to track people moving randomly and flexibly such as walking running going or stopping suddenly and turning suddenly Simulation and experimental results validated our tracking method Our method presented in this paper was applied in a centralized architecture where people\222s images detected by multiple two-layered LRSs were collected into a computer and processed by it Our research effort is directed toward a decentralized architecture this provides a degree of scalability and robustness that cannot be achieved by a

We can see that the positive effect of genetic lateral tuning became weaker as became larger for the low imbalance data sets. On the other hand, the approaches with candidate rule addition and ge netic lateral tuning \(i.e., EC and ECW*\kept good ranking in almost all cases. This observation may indicate that the proposed extensions are effective especially for the high imbalanced data sets V   C ONCLUSION  In this paper, we proposed two extensions of our genetic fuzzy rule selection for designi ng more accurate classifiers One extension is to add compatible rules with misclassified patterns into candidate rules for genetic fuzzy rule selection The other extension is to tune membership functions by genetic lateral tuning after genetic fuzzy rule selection Experimental results showed that the candidate rule addition can improve the training data accuracy. This is because the possibility that the misclassified training patterns are classified by additional rules becomes high. Experimental results also showed that the genetic lateral tuning can improve the test data accuracy as well as the training data accuracy, since fuzzy membersh ip functions are properly adjusted according to the pattern distributions. The combination of the proposed two extensions would be the best choice As a future study, we will examine the effects of the proposed extensions using a large number of data sets TABLE  VI A DJUSTED P VALUES OBTAINED BY N EMENYI 222 S T EST   H OLM 222 S T EST   S HAFFER 222 S T EST  AND B ERGMANN H OMMEL P ROCEDURE FOR THE T EST D ATA A CCURACY OBTAINED IN OUR C OMPUTATIONAL E XPERIMENTS  i Hypothesis Unadjusted p  p Neme  p Holm  p Shaf  p Berg  1 Pareto vs. ECW 3.1 x 10 10 4.8 x 10 9 4.8 x 10 9 4.8 x 10 9 4.9 x 10 9  2 Pareto vs. EC 1.6 x 10 7 2.4 x 10 6 2.2 x 10 6 1.6 x 10 6 1.6 x 10 6  3 EC vs. ECW 1.6 x 10 4 0.0024 0.0021 0.0016 0.0016 4 Pareto vs. ECW 8.0 x 10 4 0.0119 0.0095 0.0080 0.0056 5 Pareto* vs. ECW 0.0012 0.0173 0 0127 0.0116 0.0081 6 Pareto vs. Pareto 0.0024 0.0355 0 0237 0.0237 0.0142 7 ECW vs. ECW 0 0033 0.0500 0.0300 0.0237 0.0142 8 EC vs. EC 0.0064 0.0963 0.0514 0.0449 0.0385 9 Pareto vs. EC 0 0119 0.1781 0.0831 0.0831 0.0475 10 Pareto* vs. EC 0 0277 0.4156 0.1662 0.1662 0.0831 11 ECW vs. EC 0.0592 0.8876 0.2959 0.2367 0.1183 12 EC* vs. ECW 0 2945 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 13 EC vs. ECW 0.4017 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 14 EC vs. Pareto 0 6002 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 15 ECW vs. Pareto 0 7532 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 


   including data sets with more than two classes. We also have to compare the proposed method with other learning algorithms.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
