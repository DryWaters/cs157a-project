This limitation gives a lack of precision ten times the data transmission period rate 
plus two periods of the receive r synchronization clock. With the additional feature this uncertainty is reduced to two periods of the receiver synchr onization clock. The extension takes advantage of already existing capabilities of the SpaceWire standard with no impact on the data layer and very limited additional resource needs.

I NTRODUCTION   Simbol–X is a hard X–ray mission, operating in the 0.5 70 keV range, which is proposed by a consortium of European laboratories for a launch around 2013. Relying on two spacecrafts: the mirror and detector \(as sketched on Figure 1\n a formation flying configuration, SIMBOL–X uses a 20 m focal length X–ray mirror to achieve an unprecedented angular resolution \(20 arcsec HEW\ and sensitivity in the hard X–ray range. Simbol–X will allow to elucidate fundamental questions in high energy astrophysics, such as the phy 
sics of accretion onto black holes, of acceleration in quasa r jets and in supernovae remnants, or the nature of the hard X–ray diffuse emission In order to provide detection over the energy range within required resolution and taking into accounts possible detectors candidates, a configuration with two detection layers has been chosen: the focal plane detector system combines a Silicon low energy detector, efficient up to 20 keV, on top of a Cd\(Zn\gh energy detector. An active anticoincidence shield surrounds them except for the solid angle corresponding to the focused beam from the 
mirror \(see Figure 1 detector is to reject events induced by interplanetary charged particles interacting in the imaging detectors environment. In order to co mply with the limited spacecraft to ground telemetry bandwidth the discrimination shall be  Figure 2- Instrument interface architecture  Figure 1- Simbol-X formation flying 


  2 done by the flight hardware. Discrimination is achieved by performing time correlation betw een anticoincidence events and detectors events. Discrimination performance is expressed in term of dead time for the whole instrument which is an input from scientific requirements. In turn this dead time defines the time tagging resolution and accuracy of the various detector event time tagging. Therefore for the Simbol-X instrument an accuracy of 100 ns is required. The interface architecture of the instrument is depicted in Figure 2: the three detection sub-sy stems are interfacing with the Data Processing Unit \(DPDPA\eans of 3 SpaceWire links. For clock distribution purpose the detection subsystems act as destination nodes while DPDPA acts has the transmission node. In the next part of this paper we will focus on the SpaceWire standard Time-Code use limitation and improvement 2  S PACE W IRE STANDARD   The Time-Code is used to support the distribution of system time across a SpaceWire network. A Time-Code is formed by an ESC control character followed by a single datacharacter as shown in Figure 3   3   As specified in EC  when t h e i nput  si gnal  TICK_IN is asserted and th e link interface is in the Run state it shall cause the transmitter to send a Time-Code immediately after the current character has been transmitted Therefore the delay between the moment of TICK_IN assertion and the receiver d ecodes the Time-Code depend on the type of the current character transmitted and its transmitted state. The shortest delay occurs when the current character is an ESC one and its transmission is about to end. The worst delay is when current character is a Data Characters that has just start being transmitted. Best and worst case timings are represented in Figure 4 If the time tagging in SpaceWire node is done by incrementing a time counter with a valid Time_Code transmission, the resolution depends on the TICK_IN frequency. This frequency shall be lower than 1/30th of the transmission frequency in order to be able to transmit something else than Time_Code. For example a transmission frequency of 100 MHz allows a time tagging precision of about  300 ns for a TICK_IN maximum frequency of 33 MHz An alternative to increase time tagging performance is to synchronize a free running counter in the destination nodes with the TICK_OUT signal. The improved time tagging accuracy depends now on the free running counter frequency and the TICK_OUT skew, which is  13 periods of transmission clock. For example with a transmission and free running counter frequencies of 100 MHz the best achievable time tagging accuracy will be around  140 ns The TICK_IN frequency will be chosen in order to minimize the impact of the frequency stability of the free running counters Unfortunately none of the above solutions is suitable for the Simbol-X instrument where an accuracy of 100 ns is required and transmission frequency is limited to 40 MHz due to FPGA performance and margin due to derating rules applicable to space borne electronics   Figure 3 - Data Control Characters and Control codes  Figure 4 – Best and Worst Time-Code transmission delay 


  3 3  S PACE W IRE EXTENSION   The SpaceWire standard encoder-d ecoder is divided in three main functions: a transmitter, a receiver and an initialization state machine The extension to the standard is relying on two new functions that aim   To measure the time delay between a send Time_code request \(following a TICK_IN signal assertion\he effective Time_Code transmission start in the transmitter. Counting the number of rising edges of the transmission clock during this delay does this measurement. Then as soon as the main Time_Code is transmitted a second one is sent carrying the delay measurement This second Time_Code is identified by a specific Time_Code by means of two Control_Flag \(T7T6\ 0-1 while the lower four bits carry the content of the time delay counter    In the receiver when a Time_Code is received Time_out display the Time_Code. If the Time_Code is valid 4  t h e TIC K _OUT si gnal  is asserted. Then if the ne xt received character is a Time_Code and its Control_Flag are 0-1 then the four lower bits are used to get a constant and known delay between the Time_Code sent request and the TICK_OUT negative edge. Otherwise the TICK_OUT is set to 0 after a constant number of periods of clock recovery  To illustrate the benefits of the additional functions the remained of the paper will present resulting performance on the basis of a simple test configuration of simultaneous Time_code transmission toward two SpaceWire nodes Figure 5 With the proposed extension the TICK_OUT of both nodes fall synchronously as shown by the timing diagram in Figure 6. The skew between destination nodes TICK_OUT falling edges depends on propa gation delay mismatches which could be calibrated and corrected as well as the total delay with the TICK_IN rising edge The time tagging now can be generated in different ways Two of them are described below In the first method the time tagging generation is done with a counter that is incremented by the destination node SpaceWire clock recovery and load on TICK_OUT falling edge. This method has the advantage that all the destination node clocks recoveries are related to the same clock from  Fi g ure 6  Time code transmission  Figure 5 – Block diagram of the tested configuration 


  4 the transmission node. Then receiver nodes are immune to local clock mismatch and drift. The time tagging relative accuracy is equal to two transmission clock periods However a drawback may limit the use of the method: when an error occurs on one of the SpaceWire link, the corresponding node lost this time tagging synchronization with other nodes until it receives a new TICK_OUT falling edge In the second method the time tagging generation is done with a counter that is incremented by the destination node host clock and loaded on the TICK_OUT falling edge. In this method as destination node host clocks are independent the TICK_IN frequency shall be chosen in order to limit the effect of the host clocks differential drift. Thus with the proper choice of the TICK_IN frequency the highest time tagging relative accuracy may be as low as two host clock periods 4  I MPLEMENTATION  The block diagram of the SpaceWire and the proposed extension is given in Figure 7. Added functions are the Time_TX” and “Time_RX” functions. No modification of the SpaceWire standard core is required except the Ack_Time signal, which is added to the “Tx” function and used by the new “Time_TX” function. Note: to be able to implement this extension, access to time_code acknowledgement signal and recovery clock is needed Footprints of the additional functions are given in the Table 1 when targeted to XILINX SPARTAN and ACTEL SX devices and VHDL synthesi zed using SYNPLIFY PRO Target FPGA Area footprint TIME_TX Area footprint TIME_RX XILINX SPARTAN3S400 LUTs: 21 LUTs: 38 ACTEL RTSX-SU72 Combinational Cells 20 of 4024 \(< 1 Sequential Cells 16 of 2012 \(1 Combinational Cells 42 of 4024 \(1 Sequential Cells 26 of 2012 \(1 Table1 – Extension footprints If used as a time receiver from a standard SpaceWire it will behave as any others SpaceWire receiver as long as two time_codes are not send consecu tively. In that case the second will be used as a time correction and won’t be transmitted to host If used as a time master with a standard SpaceWire receiver to avoid time_code misleading the time_code correction shall be disabled or the host shall be able to discriminate between default time_code \(Control_Flag = 00\ime correction time_code \(Control_Flag = 01\e: only the use of the null time_code flag is defined, all other codes being reserved for future us es in the present standard specification [1  This extended codec is therefore fully compatible with the standard SpaceWire codec  SpaceWire encoder-decoder Tx Rx State machine Din Sin Dout Sout EnRdRx DataRx FifoEmptyRx FifoRx DataTimeOut TickOut Clock recovery ReqNcar AcqNcar Ncar Req_Time Acq_Time TimeCode EnTxClkIn EnWr Data FifoFull Time_TX Tick_In Time_In Time_Rx Time_Out Tick_Out Reset Rxclk AutoStart LinkStart LinkDisable RunStatus HostClk Clock management En10MClk EnTxClk HostClkValue  Figure 7 – Extented SpaceWire block diagram 


  5 5  N ETWORK   This extension can also be used in a SpaceWire network The same time-code distribution rules shall be followed   The only specific point is to transmit the valid time on the falling edge of TICK_OUT in order to get the full benefit of the extension  Thus with this extension th e accuracy with which system time can be distributed is still dependent upon the number of links over which it is distributed and the operating rate of those links. But now the delay is constant with at least 38 bit-periods \(data character ESC + data character + ESC data character = 10+4+10+4+10\s encountered for each link that time-code traverses. This delay is defined by design in the TIME_RX module to N > 38. Therefore the time-skew across a network is  T skew  N/A i  Tp i  1  Where Ai is the link SpaceWire i operating-rate and Tpi is propagation delay across the SpaceWire link i. This timeskew could be calculated or calibrated depending on the need of the application. Jitte r is introduced at each link by the synchronization of the TICK_OUT by the host clock Finally the total jitter is  T jitter  2*Phost_clk i  2  Where Phost_clk i is the period of the link i host clock For a network with 10 links at 100 Mbits/s, all host clocks at 100 MHz and N = 40, the time skew is 4 µs and the jitter 200 ns. All the time-skew can be corrected on each link with a time sub-counter The time accuracy across a network depends principally on synchronization jitters Using PLL to generate the host clock could increase accuracy  The following figures illustrate the time-code distribution and sub-time counter setting principle The initial state of the network is shown in shown Figure 8 The dotted lines represent the SpaceWire links between routers and nodes. N1 is the time master; the two numbers in the node and router boxes represent the time-counter and sub time-counter. In this example the time-counter unity is 1000 times the sub-time-counter unity  Figure 8 – Initial state of the network  When TICK_IN is asserted in node N1, its time-counter is incremented to 31, the sub-time-counter is reset and a timecode 31 is transmitted \(Figure 9   Figure 9  TICK_IN asserted  The transmitted time-code is received by the router R1 which checks that the time value is one more than its timecounter. Then on its TICK_OUT falling edge it increments its time-counter, sets its sub-time-counter with the transmission delay and sends out time-code on all other links \(Figure 10  Figure 10  Router R1 forwards time-codes  The transmitted time-code is received by N2 and N3. Each node checks that the time value is one more than its timecounter. Then on its TICK_OUT falling edge it increments its time-counter and sets its sub-time-counter with the transmission delay \(Figure 11  Figure 11  Destination nodes receive time-codes 


  6 6  R ESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS   Prototypes of both transmitte r and destination nodes have been developed with XILINX SPARTAN FPGA: a PCI SpaceWire board simulates the transmitter node while 2 detector acquisition boards simulate the destination nodes  The detector acquisition boards normally triggered by   are triggered in this test configuration, by an external function generator, which simulates simultaneous photon hits on the two detectors. On each trigger the acquisition el ectronics generated of time tagged event to the PCI / SpW board. The TICK_IN signal is generated internally to the transmitter node; its frequency being set by software. The presented results are measured with TICK_IN running at 1 kHz  First timing measurement on this prototype is shown in Figure 13   The upper trace \(yellow the TICK_IN signal of the transmitter and the two next traces \(Red and Green\are TICK_OUT signals of the two destination nodes. The rising edge of the TICK_OUT signal is not re-synchronized and then a large jitter of almost 160 ns is measured. This jitter corresponds to what could be obtained with a standard SpaceWire. The falling edge of the same signal is resynchronized with our extension. The resulting jitter is as low as about 4 ns and is due to cables length and propagation delay mismatches  The performance improvement shall be also demonstrated by checking the time tagging of the events. Several configurations have been successively tested in order to compare the performance of our extended SpaceWire core with respect to the standard SpaceWire core combined with the two ways to generate the time tagging in the destination node The first configuration is for a standard SpaceWire operation \(synchronization of time tagging counter on the rising edge of TICK_OUT  In this configuration the time tagging counter is incremented by the SpaceWire link recovered clock \(from the data transmission with a rate of 50 Mbits/s\e time tagging jitter in this configur ation is 200 ns \(see Figure 14 This result is compliant with the timing of the figure when considering the rising edge of the TICK_OUT. Due to limited data transfer in both directions we don’t reach the absolute maximum expected from Figure 4 \(300 ns  In the second configuration the SpaceWire is operated with our extension \(synchronization of time tagging counter on the falling edge of TICK_OUT\his configuration the time tagging counter is incremented by the SpaceWire link recovered clock \(from the data transmission with a rate of 50 Mbits/s Figure 12  Test configuration block diagram  Figure 13  TICK_IN vs TICK_OUT Timing  Figure 14  SpW std and local clock 


  7 The time tagging jitter of the configuration is 40 ns \(see Figure 15\. This result is compliant with the timing of the Figure 6 when considering the falling edge of the TICK_OUT  The third configuration is for a standard SpaceWire operation. In this configuration the time tagging counter is incremented by the local \(100 MHz\ock.The time tagging jitter of the configuration is around 300 ns \(see Figure 16  The fourth configuration is a SpaceWire with our extension operation again. In this configuration the time tagging counter is incremented by the local clock \(100 MHz The time tagging jitter of the configuration is around 30 ns see Figure 17 This configuration gives the best time tagging resolution This is due to the very low differential drift of the destination nodes \(100 MHz boards, which is less than 10 ppm     To confirm this hypothesis, another measurement was made this time with a TICK_IN period of 100 ms \(see Figure 18 The saw tooth is due to the drift of the host clock between within the TICK_IN period. The result shows that oscillators have a differential drift of about 5.6 ppm. The two small windows of the Figure 18 show that the error remains in range of 40 ns for the few first milliseconds following a re-synchronization   Figure 16  SpW std and clock recovery Figure 15  Extended SpW and clock recovery Figure 17  SpW extended and local clock Figure 18  Extended SpW and local clock 


  8 7  C ONCLUSION   We have demonstrated the benefits of the high-resolution extension to the SpaceWire st andard. Initially limited to 280 ns we are able now to ach ieve an accuracy of the time tagging of 40 ns, which represent a gain by a factor of 7 When in free running counter configuration highest time resolution could still be achie ved even with low SpaceWire data rates. In that case the time resolution is dramatically increased with our extension with respect to the standard e.g. the gain is 35 for a data rate of 10 Mbps and a 100 MHz free running counter. As mentioned the footprint of the extension stays very limited which allows an easy implementation in any space FPGA. Such an extension combines the benefits of the SpaceWire standard and highresolution time tagging without the need for another dedicated interface for cloc k and synchronization signal distribution In the Simbol-X instrument, the TICK_IN period is one second and the transmission frequency 20 MHz. Each node will use its clock recovery to increment the time tag counter The time tagging jitter will be th en of 100 ns which is fully compliant with the requirements The proposed extension may open the SpaceWire standard to new fields of application where high timing performances are needed R EFERENCES   ire: Links, Nodes, Routers and Networks European Cooperation for Space Standardization, Standard No. ECSS-E50-12A, Issue 1 January 2003   Ph Ferrando and al SIM B O L-X m i ssi on overvi e w proc.

 11  Impact \226 Strauss\222s Derivative of Moore The impact of such a simple statement is at the same time beautiful and difficult to realize.  What this is telling the designer is that 223For any technology selected, mass and power of any data recorder design will remain relatively constant even as mission data demands increase from one generation to the next.\224  What it Means For all intents and purposes, the \223fit\224 of the SSR can remain relatively constant throughout the years \226 that as the required capacity doubles, the media meets the challenge at the same pace.  Therefore, assuming a recorder of Size X  bits today and performing mass and volume predictions on that design, moving that recorder ahead several generations will result in the same mass and volume, even though the capacity of the data recorder increases exponentially Technology Comparison Table 2 is a compendium of known, published technologies in use or in development today enabling a comparison of any one technology listed for specific attributes against another.  In this stoplight chart, red indicates disfavorable attributes, green equals favorable, and yellow indicates cautionary acceptance.

The IO controller slice provides redundant SpaceWire interfaces and redundant interfaces to the backplane.  Alt hough there are two controllers shown there is, in this concept, a single set of Shared Memory which is common between both controllers One of the main functions of the active controller is to build and maintain a directory of memory sector-to-physical address translation tables.

This may consist of addition of spare memory to each memory slice, or the addition of one or more spare memory slices to the entire design With respect to Fault Tolerance, aside from the use of redundant interfaces and contro llers, described above, the HC-SSR is designed such that individual blocks of words as determined by EDAC boundaries can be tagged as Do Not Use.

 15  The architecture permits random access to any EDAC word within the recorder. Simultaneous writing and reading is supported.  Memory is divisible into blocks with an unlimited number of blocks forming a Sector.   Each sector contains information that permits reconstruction of the File Structure independent of the CDH Sector Definition As unique Data Units are identified by the CDH host, the SSR commences placement of information in the first available memory location The information placed therein contains information identifying the Sector and relevant information with respect to data unit identification  Figure 22 - Sector & Data Unit Structure Each sector of information has contained within identification as to the next sector tag as well as the tag of the previous sector.  In this way, should the file structure need to be rebuilt, a scan of memory anywhere will reveal not only the type and source of information encountered but also the logical placement of a ll relevant information before and after this data block Consumables For Flash memory technology, the data is stored, and erased, by the imposition of high voltages onto the substrate and controlling gates.  Therefore, this technology is stressful to the device and is rated to 100,000 write or erase cycles NROM technology uses a different charge storage mechanism and is therefore not subject to write/erase degradation Stability Testing has shown commercial NROM devices to retain data up to 300 krads, a simple refreshment following exposure permits a likewise gain in radiation tolerance That is 300krads, refresh, 600 krads, etc [1   Flash devices are prone to damaging charge-trapping and therefore do not benefit by the refreshment scheme outlined above.  The users of Flash must take the surrounding radiation environment into consideration when declaring the number of write cycles a certain design can accommodate Chassis Dimensions and mass for the HC-SSR assume the chassis is manufactured in 100 mils aluminum,  One possible design is shown in Figure 23  Figure 23 \226 Packaging Concept \226 HC-SSR Power Worst case power estimation for the Flash unit is 6W and 30W for an NROM-based design 9 The power estimation includes both SpaceWire interfaces enabled and simultaneous read and write of information occurring Unused non-volatile memory devices are unpowered and the non-addressed memory contro ller ASICs are in a Deep Sleep mode 8  C ONCLUSION  A review of data storage technologies was presented and evidence presented to affirm the assertion known as 223Moore\222s Law\224 that storage capacity of a single element will increase every \(a pprox.\0 months A prognostication of data recorder capacity requirements for future JPL mission and programs has been made.  Based upon a past history spanning over thirty years, it is clearly evident that required capacity will progress at an exponential rate, effectively mimicking the rate provided in Moore\222s Law.  A new Axiom is coined:  A reasonable accurate prediction of data recorder volume and power can be made when based upon today\222s technology and today\222s data storage requirements   9 Power margin \(uncer tainty\cluded in these figures Header/Sector ID Next Previous Data Unit Header Data Data Sector   Data Data Unit End Flag Next Previous

As the absorption is greatly affected by the molecular structure of the material, citations should al so indicate the material as a subscript to the term 223rad\224, as in rad Si indicating Silicon equivalency.  For the purposes of this paper, radiation equivalency always assumes Silicon For completeness, it should be noted that System International replaced the \223rad\224 with the unit Gr ay \(Gy\nd having an equivalency of 100 rads = 1 Gy [27 How e v e r   the use of rads, kilorads, megarads remains in the industry vernacular and is used in this document Moore\222s Law Named after Fairchild Semiconductor technologist Gordon Moore, Moore\222s law was derived from empirical data which shows that the dimensions of basic memory cells will shrink by approximately 50% of the previous value every 30 to 36 months.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual

Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
