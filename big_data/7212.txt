Several hundred aircraft use the link through a satellite at busy times.  Once 
the link is disconnected due to a failure of a GES or satellite hundreds of aircraft initiate access for re-logon to a GES almost simultaneously, and the link may be congested excessively.  Many aircraft in f light are not able to complete re-logon for a long time, and the safety of those aircraft is greatly endangered.  This paper describes the phenomenon of excessive link congestion due to log on sequence initiations by hundreds of aircraft in the event of a GES or satellite failure, then some methods to minimize the period for re-logon, and finally the effectiveness of those methods as demonstrated through a series of simulations 12  T ABLE OF C ONTENTS  1

introduced for oceanic ATC Several satellites of MTSAT Multi-functional Transport Satellite\d INMARSAT are used to provide communication services for aircraft flying over the oceans globally.  Usi ng satellite communication, an air traffic controller and a p ilot can exchange requests or instructions during a flight along oceanic air routes in a reliable manner, and it contributes significantly to the safety and efficiency of transoceanic flight 1  1 978-1-4244-26225/09/$25.00 \2512009 IEEE 2 IEEEAC paper #1130, Version 6, Updated December 15, 2008 The satellite communication for ATC uses a data communication protocol specified in international standards 
called AMSS SARPs \(Standards and Recommended Practices on Aeronautical Mobile Satellite Services\f the International Civil Aviation Organization \(ICAO\r to the start of communication, each aircraft equipped with an Aircraft Earth Station \(AES\ust log on to a Ground Earth Station \(GES\specified in the SARPs on 600 bps channels in the satellite link before take-off This operation is usually nece ssary once for each flight Then, the aircraft and the ATC center can send and receive messages through a satellite link while in flight Hundreds of aircraft are logged on to a GES through a satellite link at busy times.  When the link disconnects due to a failure of a particular GES or satellite, each aircraft detects the link disconnection by loss of signal from the satellite.  Then, all aircraft using the satellite start a re-logon procedure almost simultaneously for an alternative satellite 
and GES.  This may give rise to significant link congestion It may take a very long time, even 60 minutes or more, for many aircraft to log on to an alternative GES again.  We call this phenomenon log-on rush in this paper.  The phenomenon is also called log-on storm.  Since those aircraft cannot communicate with an ATC center during a re-logon procedure, they are in a very dangerous situation In this paper, we first describe in summary the log-on sequence specified in the SARP s.  Then, we show the logon rush phenomenon obtained from a series of simulations Subsequently, we describe some methods to mitigate the phenomenon.  Finally, we show the effectiveness of those mitigation methods using simulations 2  A ERONAUTICAL 
S ATELLITE C OMMUNICATION  Configuration of Aeronautic al Satellite communication Figure 1 shows the configuration of an aeronautical satellite link.  The AES onboard an aircraft can communicate in duplex with a terrestrial GES via a geostationary satellite When an AES starts to use the aeronautical satellite link, the AES at first needs to log on to a particular GES via a satellite.  The procedure of "Log-on" is a kind of registration for communication to the GES.  When the AES does not need to communicate w ith the GES any more after a flight, the AES must log off from the GES.  The 


  2 procedure of "Log-off\224 is the cancellation of the registration to the GES R-channel and T-channel are us ed in the link from an AES to a GES.  R-channel is a random access channel using a slotted ALOHA scheme.  An AES can transmit the data with a length of less than 34 octets on the channel to a GES at any time and at random.  One octet equals 8 bits in this paper.  R-channel is used to transmit signaling data such as request and user data.  T-channel is a time division multiple access \(TDMA\e slot allocated by a GES to transmit user data of over 33 octets P-channel is used in the link from a GES to an AES.  Pchannel is a time division multiplex \(TDM\annel.  The data in a transmission queue is transmitted on the channel in a sequential order.  P-channel is used to transmit signaling data such as acknowledge and user data As described above, T-channel is used for transmission of user data, but P-channel and R-channel are used for transmission of both signaling and user data.  In addition, Pchannel and R-channel are classified into two kinds.  Two of the channels are called P smc and R smc used only in a logon procedure for system management.  Another two are used both in a log-on procedure and in signaling for data transmission called P d and R d  The channel rates are 600, 1200, 4800, and 10500 bps for P-channels, R-channels and T-ch annels as specified in the AMSS SARPs.  But, current GES and AES are operated for channel rates of 600, 1200, or 10500 bps.  In a log-on procedure, only 600 bps can be used presently according to the AMSS SARPs Log-on Sequence Figure 2 shows an example of a log-on sequence.  An AES transmits a log-on request to a GES on R-channel \(R smc  After the log-on request is received at the GES, the GES refers to an AES authorization table, and transmits a log-on confirm to the AES on P-channel \(P smc for P/R channel control and T-channel control if the AES is eligible and the GES can support the services requested by the AES.  After the AES receives the log-on confirm, the AES transmits a log-on acknowledge to the GES on R-channel \(R d  the GES returns a log-on acknowledge to the AES on Pchannel \(P d After the log-on procedure is completed, both the AES and the GES can start data transmissions When transmitted data is lost on R smc or R d channels due to congestion or deterioration in propagation conditions during the log-on procedure, the lost data is retransmitted after a certain period.  Retransmissions are repeated 5 times at maximum. If the link is conge sted and many collisions occur, a long delay results.  For P smc or P d channels, there is no loss of data due to collision, but the data may be delayed in a queue for transmission if the link is congested Log-on Rush Phenomenon When a data communication link is disconnected by a failure of a GES or satellite, the AES using the GES or satellite detects it by the loss of a P-channel signal.  Then the AES begins a re-logon procedure.  Since hundreds of AES are logged on to a GES at busy times and they try to use the same satellite link almost simultaneously, it causes excessive congestion in the link.  It may take a long time sometimes more than one hour, for many AES to complete a log-on procedure.  We refer to this phenomenon as "log-on rush phenomenon" in this paper.  The phenomenon is also called log-on storm Since many AES in flight lose their means of communication during a re-logon procedure, it greatly endangers the safety of those aircraft.  So, the period required for a re-logon must be minimized P ch an n el R T  ch an n e l R T  ch an n e l P ch an n el   Fig.1  Configuration of Current Aeronautical Satellite Link  Fig.2  Log-on Sequence  


  3 3  S IMULATION A NALYSIS  Simulation In general, data transmi ssion performances for data communication system are analy zed theoretically by using a queuing model or by using a computer simulation.  The former is useful when the protocol is simple and easily modeled.  But, if the former is not useful, a computer simulation is used The log-on process described in the previous section cannot be easily modeled by a queuing model, because several different channels interact w ith each other and because its process is transient in natu re.  We used a computer simulation to analyze log-on performance when many AES start a re-logon procedure in the case of a failure of GES or satellite The computer simulation was based on the protocol simulator called OPNET.  The protocol model for AMSS called ASET made by Mayflower Inc. was modified and incorporated into OPNET Parameter Setting in Simulation There are several parameters to be set in the simulation One of them is a log-on window.  Once each AES detects the loss of a P-channel, it observes the P-channel for 10 seconds.  If the P-channel is not still restored, each AES starts to send a log-on request to an alternative GES or satellite.  In that case, each AE S starts the procedure within a very short period.  In the simulation, the period is defined as a log-on window, and it is set to be 10 seconds.  In this setting, each AES starts to send a log-on request randomly in a log-on window of 10 s Another parameter is the number of AES.  Since 500 AES are logged on at maximum in the Pacific Ocean Region, the number of AES is set to be 500 For each setting, simulations are repeated 20 times Log-on Rush Phenomenon In this section, we show the log-on rush phenomenon through simulation results.  Figure 3 shows the number of logged-on AES vs. Time when 500 AES start a log-on procedure in a log-on window of 10 s.  In the simulation the typical channel configuration of one P smc 3 R smc one R d  and 3 R d channels is assumed in this paper.  The ordinate indicates the number of AES that completed a log-on by the time indicated on the abscissa.  The number of logged-on AES increases with time until all AES complete a log-on The black curves represent th e result for each trial.  The blue curve represents the mean time for 20 trials and the red curve the 95 % time for 20 trials.  In this figure, it is seen that the mean time for 500 AES to complete a log-on is about 4500 s and the 95% time about 5400 s.  The difference between minimum and maximum times is more than 1000 s 4  P ROPOSED M ITIGATION OF L OG ON RUSH PHENOMENON  Method of Mitigation We consider three methods for the mitigation of log-on rush phenomenon in this paper.  The first method is the asymmetric use of R smc channels.  The second is the increase of channel rate of R smc channels.  The third is the increase in the number of R smc channels Asymmetric Use of R smc Channels Figure 4 \(a\he configuration of an AES Table at a GES. Eight R smc channels \(channel #A, channel #B, \205 channel #H\aximum, and the table is always broadcasted to all AES on P-channel.  Each AES selects one of the R smc channels in the table randomly with the same probability to send a log-on request Figure 4 \(b\ple of the AES Table in current operation.  In this case, 3 R smc channels \(channel #A channel #B, channel #C\of them is specified in 3 different rows of the Table.

  4 probability, and the probability to use each of the three channels is the same.  In Fig.3, this configuration of 3 R smc  channels is used.  As shown in Fig.3, all R smc channels were overloaded, and it caused a long delay in log-on completion Figure 4 \(c\ple of asymmetric use of R smc  channels.  In this example, 3 R smc channels \(channel #A channel #B, channel #C\lable.  Channel #A is specified in 5 rows of the Table, channel #B in 2 rows, and channel #C in one row.  Each AES selects one of the 8 channels \(rows\ly with the same probability.  Since the probability to select one of the 8 channels \(columns\is 1/8, the probability of selecting channel #A, channel #B and channel #C is 5/8, 2/8 and 1/8, respectively.  If the probability of using each R smc channel is changed adequately, there is a possibility to mitigate the log-on rush phenomenon by creating some lightly loaded channels The effectiveness of the asymmetric use of R smc channels to mitigate the log-on rush phe nomenon was evaluated by simulation for the 5 cases of R smc channel configuration shown in Table 1.  It is assumed that three R smc channels are available.  The number of P smc P d and R d channels is 1, 1 and 3, respectively.  Figure 5 shows the simulation results for cases #1, #3 and #5.  In the figures, the ordinate represents the number of AES that completed a log-on by the time indicated on the absci ssa.  Black curves show the result for each trial.  The blue curve shows the mean time for 20 trials, and the red curve the 95 % time for 20 trials Table 2 shows the minimum, maximum, mean, and 95 times by which 500 AES completed a log-on for 5 cases listed in table 1.  For comparison, the values derived from the result shown in Fig.3 are also listed for the case of symmetric use of R smc channels \(indicated as "case #None For the symmetric use of R smc channels, maximum time required for a log-on completion is over 5000 s.  Maximum time for case #5 is about 1104 s, the smallest value of all cases.  The time required for a log-on completion becomes smaller in the order of cases #1 to #5 as shown in table 2 The results of all asymmetric cases \(cases #1 to #5\are better than that of the symme tric case \(case #None log-on rush phenomenon can be prevented almost completely for case #5.  The difference between maximum and minimum times is 1444 s for case #None, but 142 s for Table 1   Channel Assignment in AES Table Number of each Channel in AES allocation table Case Channel #A Channel #B Channel #C 1 3 3 2 2 4 2 2 3 4 3 1 4 5 2 1 5 6 1  1                                a                                b                                c  Fig.5   Time required for log-on in the case of mitigation based on the asymmetric use of R smc channels Table 2   Time required for logged-on completion of AES Case Min Max Mean 95% Value 1 2834 3893 3291 3681 2 2101 2625 2325 2532 3 1336 1548 1426 1540 4 1184 1451 1265 1376 5 962 1104 1040 1085 None 3991 5435 4586 5414  


  5 case #5 Increase of channel rate for log-on If the channel rate for a log-on procedure is increased, there is a possibility that the log-on rush phenomenon can be mitigated even with a smaller number of channels Presently, only 600 bps in channel rate is used for a log-on procedure.  But, since a channel rate of 10500 bps is used to transmit user data in the present operation, it is conceivable that 10500 bps could be used for a log-on procedure, too We evaluated the log-on performance for the channel rate of 10500bps for this purpose Figure 6 \(a\he results for the case of using 10500 bps for the channel rate of P smc R smc P d and R d channels There are one each of P smc R smc P d and R d channels.  The log-on rush phenomenon is not observed until about 250 AES complete a log-on.  But after that, the effect of the phenomenon is observed.  Maximum time required for a log-on of 500 AES was over 3700 s Figure 6 \(b\2 R d channels.  The number of other channels is the same as in Fig.6 \(a Since the R d channel was overloaded in the previous configuration, the number of R d channels was doubled.  It was observed that the effect of log-on rush phenomenon can be prevented by decreasing the load of R d channels Maximum time required for a log-on completion was about 700 s.  If the channel rate is increased, the log-on rush phenomenon can be prevented with a smaller number of channels, and the time required for a log-on procedure can also be decreased Increase of Number of Channel We added one 600 bps R smc channel to the former setting of three 600 bps R smc channels \(case #None\gure 7 shows the time required for a log-on of a particular number of AES in the case of 4 R smc channels.  The number of R d channel is unchanged.  The figure shows that it is effective to mitigate the phenomenon.  All AES completed a log-on in about 1500 s.  This result is almost the same as that in Fig.5 \(b 5  D ISCUSSION  Collision of Log-on Request In this section, we analyze the effect of collisions between log-on requests on the log-on rush phenomenon.

  6 shows an example of the number of log-on requests collisions during the period wh en 500 AES tried to log on for case #None in Table 2.  This figure shows the result for 20 trials.  The log-on sequences are repeated until all AES conplete a log on.  The number of log-on request collisions are 100 or more when the sequence started.  Then, it decreased rapidly to the range between 10 and 30 and continued until 3500 s.  The l og-on requests continued to conflict with each other, but the number of AES decreased over time as the number of AES that had completed log-ons increased.  Then, after the last AES completed a log on collision of log-on requests di ed out at about 5000 s as shown in Fig.8 Figure 9 shows an example of log-on requests collision numbers for the cases described in the previous section c\show the case of asymmetric use of R smc  e channel rate.  Figure 9\(f\case of increased R smc  channels.  The number of collisions decreased more rapidly and died out earlier for all cases in Fig.9 than that of the symmetric case shown in Fig.8.  For example, the collisions died out in about 1000 s for case #5 \(Fig.9\(c\s value is much smaller than the value of about 5000 s in Fig.8 This means that the log-on rush phenomenon is mainly caused by the large number of collisions and their long continuation               a\ase #1     d d channel               b\ase #3     e d channels               c     f smc channels  Fig.9 An example of log-on re quest collision number with Time for three mitigation methods 


  7 Figure 9 \(d\ows that the number of collisions decreased rapidly until about 1000 s, but th en it subsequently leveled off and continued until about 3000 s.  This means that the congestion of R smc channel decreased rapidly for first 1000 s but then another cause delayed the completion of log-on Figure 9 \(e\R d channels are doubled.  As shown, it was observed that the number of collisions decreased rapidly, a nd died out by about 700 s This shows that the congestion of R d channel caused the number of collisions to level off in Fig.9 \(d Figure 9 \(f\ber of collisions decreased rapidly, and died out by about 1300 s.

But the traffic on R d channel increased rapidly, and it became overloaded.  This caused the continuation of many collisions on R d channel \(Fig.10 \(a\he log-on rush phenomenon.  Figure 10 \(b\hat the congestion on R d channel is prevented by increasing the number of R d  channels and that the log-on rush phenomenon is prevented It should be noted that even if R smc channel has good transmission ability, the log-on rush occurs depending on the ability of R d channel to deal with a large number of logons in a short period of time Throughput and Traffic on R smc Channels Figure 11 shows the relationship between traffic and throughput on R smc channel for the case of symmetric use of channels \(Fig.3 indicates the result of each R smc  channel for each of 20 trials.  60 points are plotted in the figure, because there are 3 R smc channels and 20 trials Traffic is defined by the ratio of the sum of transmitted data length in time and the transmission period.  Throughput is defined by the ratio of the su m of received data length in time and the transmission period.  The curve shows the theoretical curve for slotted ALOHA channels calculated from the following equation  where S is throughput and G traffic It can be seen that all th ree channels were extremely overloaded to a similar extent \(500-550 % traffic\thus throughput of all channels was very low \(about 5 %\he congestion on the channels continued for a long time.  This caused many AES to complete a log-on only after a very long time Figure 12 shows the relationship between traffic and throughput on R smc channels for the cases of asymmetric use of R smc channels, increased channel rate and increased number of R smc c\he case of asymmetric use of R smc e show the case of increased channel rate.

This result shows that the congestion on the two channels for this case decreased and this mitigated the logon rush phenomenon slightly as shown in Fig.5\(a In Fig.12 \(b\traffic for three channels is about 150 %, 450500 % and 600-650 %, respectively.  Throughput of those channels is 25-30 %, about 10 % and about 5 respectively.

This result shows that the congestion on each channel decreased by increasing the number of R smc channels and this mitigated the log-on rush phenomenon considerably as shown in Fig.7 Advantages and Disadvantages of Each Method Asymmetric Use of R smc Channel 227One of the advantages is that it is effective for a channel rate of 600 bps without increasing the number of channels.  Another is that it can be realized just by modifying the GES software without modifying any avionics software.  Since the modification of avionics software involves much difficulty, we consider this method to be the best alternative at present Increase of Channel Rate 227One of the advantages is that the number of required channels can be decreased.  Another is that the period required for a log-on can be the shortest compared to the other two methods.  The disadvantage is that some modification of GES and avionics software is required.  This method should be considered for realization in the future Increase of Number of Channel 227One of the advantages is that it is effective for a channel rate of 600 bps.  Another is that it can be realized very easily by increasing the number of channels.  The disadvantage is that, since frequency allocation is limited in general, it may not be possible to increase the number of channels 6  C ONCLUSIONS  In this paper, we descri bed the log-on rush phenomenon which may occur in the event of a GES or satellite failure in aeronautical satellite communi cation and possible methods to mitigate the phenomenon.  We showed as an example that it takes more than 5000 s for all 500 AES to complete a log-on for a typical channel configuration Then, we considered three methods of mitigation and analyzed the effectiveness of these by a series of simulations.  The first method was the asymmetric use of R smc channels.  We showed that the phenomenon can be almost completely prevented by choosing an adequate channel configuration without changing the channel rate and without increasing the number of R smc channels.  The second was the increase of channel rate of R smc channels We showed that the phenomenon can be prevented by this method using a smaller number of channels and that the time required for all AES to complete a log on can be reduced compared to the previous method.  The third was the increase in the number of R smc channels.  This is a straightforward method.  We showed that it is also effective to mitigate the phenomenon without increasing the channel rate.  But, the number of channels may not be increased freely, because frequency resources are limited We consider that the asymmetric use of R smc channel is the best alternative to mitigate the log-on rush phenomenon at present. The increase of channel rate will be a prospective measure to be realized in the fu ture.  It is also conceivable that these two measures could be combined to improve logon performance further The time for hundreds of AES to complete a log-on is still more than 1000 s even with the asymmetric use of R smc  channel.  This value is still very large and should be reduced.  Since only one P smc channel can be used per GES according to the AMSS SARPs, throughput of P smc channel is limited and this causes a very long time for log-on completion.  The reduction of the time is a problem that should be solved next A CKNOWLEDGEMENT  We would like to thank everyone concerned at INMARSAT Corporation, Japan Civil Aviation Bureau and Japan Radio Air Navigation Systems Association for their cooperation R EFERENCES    Al an Schust e r B ruce, Per Nokeby 223Log-on Issues\224, FANS Satcom Improvement Team 2 nd meeting in Paris, Oct 2007 2 n au tical Mo b ile Satellite Serv ices Stan d ard s and Recommended Practices   INM A RSAT: INM A RSAT AERONAUTICAL SYSTEM DEFINITION MANUAL\224, 2000  Y.Sum i y a A.Ishi de  223A St udy of Log-on R u sh usi ng Aeronautical Satellite Communication Simulator\224, The 2007 IEICE General Conference, Mar. 2007 \(Japanese only B IOGRAPHY  Yasuto Sumiya was born in Sapporo Japan.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs. Essentially, Atom Service Casting may be viewed as a more human-friendly approach to UDDI R EFERENCES   NASA and Energy and W a t e r cy cl e St udy NEW S website: http://www.nasa-news.org  R odgers, C  D., and B  J.
