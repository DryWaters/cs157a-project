The Mars Science Laboratory entry capsule is used as an example to demonstrate how a blunt body of revolution must be treated as asymmetric in some respects when 337ying at a non-zero trim angle of attack A brief description of the axisymmetric moment equations are provided before solving a system of equations describing the lateral-directional moment equations for a blunt body trimming at an angle of attack Simplifying assumptions are made which allow the solution to the equations to be rearranged to relate the roll and yaw stability with sideslip angle to the frequency of oscillation of the vehicle body rates The equations show that for a blunt body the roll and yaw rates are in phase and proportional to each other The

ratio of the rates is determined by the static stability coef\336cients and mass properties about those axes A trajectory simulation is used to validate the static yaw stability parameter identi\336cation equation and a simple method of identifying the oscillation frequency from the body rates The approach is shown to successfully extract the modeled yaw stability coef\336cient along a simulated Mars entry Mars Science Laboratory 337ight data results are presented from earlier work which indicate that results from both the validation case and 337ight data are in agreement with pre\337ight predictions A brief discussion of the dynamic stability is also provided Trimming at a nonzero angle suggests that the typical axisymmetric models of the dynamic stability coef\336cients should be modi\336ed However further experimental or computational work must be done to separate damping due to body rates and wind relative rates before the correct lifting formulation would affect simulation results T ABLE OF C ONTENTS 1N

This will be brie\337y discussed below For blunt bodies the damping moments are small compared to traditional aircraft which have long moment arms from the center of gravity and large aerodynamic surfaces that resist rotational motion While small the damping characteristics can have signi\336cant impact on blunt vehicle dynamics especially for vehicles without a control system Analysis described brie\337y below found that better measurements or predictions of blunt body damping derivatives are required before a correct implementation of the damping terms in simulation will have any signi\336cant in\337uence of capsule damping predictions The Mars Science Laboratory entry descent and landing EDL reconstruction was the genesis of the analysis presented here Therefore the MSL entry vehicle geometry is used here as an example of a blunt body of revolution 337own at angle of attack where some axisymmetric assumptions are no longer valid The MSL entry vehicle consists of a 65 59.73 meter 4 C angle cone and blunt sphere sections The forebody shape is typically driven by a combination of heating and stability requirements depending on entry velocity and the planet atmosphere pro\336le Backshell geometries are typically axisymmetric as well with the speci\336c shape frequently driven by payload constraints Often these bodies of revolution are 337own with the center of gravity cg aligned with the axis of symmetry and therefore trim at zero degrees total angle of attack This symmetry simpli\336es how aerodynamic forces and moments are modeled in any 337ight simulations used for mission design and landing site targeting The static forces and moments can be tabulated as functions of total angle of attack only and decomposed into six-degreeof-freedom coef\336cients with angles of attack and sideslip as the independent variables for use in simulation Often the dynamic stability derivatives are modeled as functions of total angle of attack as well In contrast a conventional airplane requires that aerodynamic coef\336cients be described independently about and along the roll pitch and yaw axes or other convenient six degree-of-freedom coordinate system When an axisymmetric vehicle uses a radial center of gravity offset to 337y at an angle of attack relative to the approaching wind axisymmetry is broken and in some ways the aerodynamic coef\336cients must be described more like an airplane On August 5 2012 the Mars Science Laboratory MSL entry vehicle successfully slowed the Curiosity rover during its entry descent and landing in Gale crater on Mars Both the aeroshell and entry architecture for MSL were derived from previous successful con\336gurations used to land on Mars which have all been based on the Viking missions of the 1970\325 MSL w as the 336rst since V iking to use an of fset center of gravity to 337y a lifting trajectory Like the Viking entry vehicles a reaction control system was used to control the vehicle In addition MSL was the 336rst to use the RCS system to 337y a guided entry to land within a small landing ellipse on Mars During the planning for and execution of the 337ight reconstruction it became obvious that the 337ight mechanics of the MSL vehicle with its offset center of gravity are more complex than those of more recent Mars missions which had all 337own ballistically with no cg offset The MSL data reduction was the inspiration for the analysis in this paper and will be used as an example The full equations of motion provide the tools to understand the impact of the capsule 337ying at an asymmetric orientation relative to the approaching wind The yawing moment equation is separated into a linearized system of equations for a blunt body 337ying at angle of attack The re-expression of the moment equation is used to show how the yawing moment slope  is properly extracted from body rates and and the moments of inertia about the roll and pitch axes A 337ight simulation of the MSL entry is used to validate the method of extracting the yaw stability and reconstruction results of the MSL 337ight trajectory are presented as well These cases provide examples of how a simple relation can accurately extract the yaw stability for a lifting blunt body from measured body rates Like the static moments the pitch and yaw damping coef\336cients should be modeled asymmetrically for a lifting 337ight Unfortunately it is very dif\336cult to measure or compute the separate contributions to damping from rotational rates sphere-cone heatshield with a backshell made of a series of truncated cones The vehicle geometry and reference parameters are described in Figure 1 and the aerodynamic coef\336cient and coordinate system de\336nitions are shown in Figure 2 The capsule dimensions shown in Figure 1 are simpli\336ed but suf\336cient for describing the geometry of the 337ight vehicle The design and measured diameters and projected areas based on those diameters show how the capsule design and what was fabricated changed slightly from the original speci\336cations set early in the project The mass listed here is for the fully fueled entry vehicle measured before launch Some representative details of the MSL entry are described in later sections as the lateral-directional equations of motion are applied to simulation and 337ight data For details of the

measured body rates to determine the oscillatory components Once the constant rates have been subtracted the remaining oscillatory parts of the roll and yaw rates are the components of a pure sideslip oscillation Equation 29 becomes term is small compared to the term for reasonable blunt body trim angles For a very useful 336rst order approximation the yaw stability is scaled by the cosine of the trim angle for a given measured frequency 37 This development of equations is shown to provide rigorous explanation of how the oscillatory rates are correlated and how constant body rates can be present as well Equation 37 could also have been determined directly from Equation 22 by making the assumption that the term was small Also note that Equation 37 reduces to Equation 8 when  Theoretically the frequency can be extracted from a roll or yaw rate history measured as the frequency of both are the same and in phase In practice the yaw rate  Accounting for heaving and gravity effects on the sideslip rate will alter and complicate this equation more accurately capturing the relationship between the body and wind-relative oscillations but complicating the data reduction process Yaw Damping 38 As it is very dif\336cult to separate the damping due to yaw rate from the damping due to sideslip rate the damping coef\336cients have historically been lumped together and multiplied by the average of the yaw and sideslip rates or one of the two selected over the other to calculate the damping moments As has been shown above for a vehicle that trims at angle of attack the axes of rotation for these two rates are not parallel so this averaging is an additional approximation This issue has long been a problem for high angle-of-attack aircraft dynamic testing and modeling 13 F or e xample forced oscillation tests typically impose an oscillating yaw rate term with the assumption that term can not be neglected especially at low speeds and in a windy environment where wind-relative and body rates can differ considerably An extensive study was undertaken to improve how the yaw and sideslip damping coef\336cients were modeled for a vehicle like MSL trimming at angle of attack The analysis was hampered by the long-existing problem of having no practical method of separating the damping coef\336cients While a mathematical expression was developed which more correctly implemented the damping coef\336cients similar to the static relations developed above in simulation it was shown that the new mathematical formulation did not affect capsule dynamics appreciably Until there is a method to separate from the authors found no compelling reason to deviate from the yaw damping implementation shown in Equation 38 even when 337ying at an angle of attack

turn is executed Any extreme maneuvers are transient and not oscillatory so even cases that see large sideslip rates do not experience oscillations over a long time where damped or undamped vehicle characteristics can drive oscillation growth In contrast blunt entry vehicles have no large aerodynamic surfaces to damp rates They can see persistent oscillations about the pitch and yaw axes that can produce signi\336cant amplitudes depending on the damping characteristics often dynamically unstable at supersonic speeds Therefore the 34 This expression is quite powerful It says that the roll and yaw rates are correlated by the yaw and roll static stability coef\336cients and the moments of inertia about those axes For a sideslip oscillation the yaw and roll rates are in phase and differ by a constant scale factor The stability coef\336cients can then be extracted from these body rates For a non-banking case Equation 28 is rearranged into an expression for the yaw stability In addition to the static moments being complicated by the non-zero trim angle of attack consider how the dynamic stability of a blunt body is modeled The yaw damping moment has typically been modeled with the following relation or something similar for blunt bodies regardless of trim angle r   N I 35 and likewise for roll stability sin C C r

small This method of identifying the frequency of oscillation from the rate data was selected as a reliable and robust technique There are other methods that may produce more accurate results at a discrete point Such improvements are left for later work A representative MSL trajectory was selected to validate the relationships between pitch and yaw static stability and   is the frequency of

selection of these quiescent periods ensured that the data being used to identify aerodynamic properties of the vehicle were taken from regions of the trajectory where the vehicle was subject to only aerodynamic forces and gravity In order to compute  a range or window of yaw rate data was taken around each of these points and a sinusoid function of the following form was 336tted to this 322truth\323 signal 40 In this equation is a constant offset representing any constant component of the yaw rate A similar equation was 336t to the pitch data to compute and the angle-of-attack data to obtain the trim angle  used to compute in Equation 37 A simple cost function was constructed to take the root sum square of the difference between the true yaw rate signal and the 336tted signal calculated from Equation 40 An optimizer was used to 336nd values of that minimized the cost function producing the best 336t to the true yaw signal The length of the data window over which the signal was 336tted was chosen to provide one to two oscillations of the sinusoid Through this cost function minimization technique the 336tted pitch and yaw frequencies of oscillation were extracted and used to compute and  bank reversal performed to place the powered-landing descent-stage\325s radar system in the proper orientation for operation after heatshield separation and later separation of the

landing in Gale crater Most conditions of this simulation are very close to those predicted to occur on the day of landing so analysis of this simulation is representative of what was to be expected and what in fact was measured from 337ight telemetry Early in the trajectory Mach number is increasing both because of temperature variations in the rare\336ed segment of the atmosphere and because gravity is causing the capsule\325s planet-relative velocity to increase prior to entering the more dense 322continuum\323 portion of the atmosphere The peak deceleration occurs near Mach 16 Figure 6 shows the roll pitch and yaw body rates for the 12GAL-01 simulation The most obvious features of this plot are the bank reversals indicated by the coordinated spikes in the roll and yaw rates These maneuvers are executed during the range control phase of entry to modulate the lift vector in order to reach a targeted downrange location before entering the heading alignment phase Starting near 690 seconds the capsule enters heading alignment Note the segments of small but constant roll rate varying in sign during this phase This is indicative of small residual bank rates as the capsule drifts
