this group of business owners might be to nurture and sustain their interest in IT while providing them with resources to incorporate IT into their businesses Wolcott et al. [45 d e sc r i be  a n in no va t i ve p r o c e ss o f  IT Therapy as a means to help micro-enterprises adopt IT  The above analysis of the three attitude groups illustrates how interventions can be applied to microenterprises. An understanding of technology attitude groups may facilitate interventions to aid these groups in overcoming IT hurdles and moving to the next stage of growth and development It appears that different Technology attitude groups Qureshi et al a v e diff eren t un ders tan d i n gs of capabilities of technology. For example, some business owners with limited exposure to technology see it only as a productivity aid, whereas others with more exposure see IT as a means to enter new markets Despite the differences in micro-entrepreneurs  understanding of how IT may benefit their businesses they all seem to converge on the notion that using IT in some way will help their business. Our analysis seems to suggest a conceptual model that depicts the behavior expressed by our set of rural micro-enterprises as related to IT adoption and potential development outcomes \(figure 1 Figure 1 shows that there is a relationship between a micro-entrepreneur s attitude towards IT and development outcomes that might arise within his/her business as a result of IT adoption. However the extent to which the development outcomes are achieved for the technology adoption groups is illustrated in the arrows that link these groups to the specific development outcomes. Micro-entrepreneurs in the Positive specific category tend to benefit more from new market access and would be adopters of websites for example. Micro-entrepreneurs in the positive holistic category would tend to benefit more from technologies that enable information to be accessed such as the use of search engines and portals. The micro-entrepreneurs in the positive limited category would benefit from IT to achieve productivity gains such as through software for bookkeeping    It is important to emphasize here that although we posit a relationship between our technology attitude group construct and our development construct, we have not drawn conclusions as to the direction of the relationship between the two in our conceptual model In other words, it is yet to be investigated whether adoption attitudes lead to IT adoption and bring about business development, or whether perceived business development outcomes foster changes in attitude While the causality is uncertain, the characteristics of these businesses nonetheless lend themselves to certain conjectures about what kinds of interventions may be helpful to grow these very small businesses in the future. As it turns out, these characteristics tend to suggest that rural micro-entrepreneurs may be most effective in growing businesses if they gain a broad perspective on technology. The extent of technology knowledge within each technology attitude group seems to be associated with specific development outcomes, with the breadth of envisioned outcomes increasing alongside the knowledge   6. Implications for micro-enterprise growth  Our analysis leads us to suggest a number of implications and guidelines to help address microenterprises needs in terms of IT adoption and bringing about business growth One such guideline would be to make provisions through local universities or non-profit organizations to provide seminars for micro-enterprises to increase their awareness towards IT and show them how technology can help their business Our results suggest \(Table 3\at there was a strong consensus that the micro-enterprises needed to reach new markets. A potential guideline here would be to make business owners aware that the Internet is highly collaborative in nature and that they can use Internet technology build partnerships with other businesses to accrue many benefits. This would help these small businesses enhance their market reach to potential customers through business-to-business collaborations over the Internet The other large problem perceived by the microentrepreneurs was a lack of time. This might be addressed by a technology intervention involving the creation of a common technology platform to create administrative efficiencies for these businesses for bread and butter business tasks like accounting. The business owners could be referred to community college and/or regular college training classes to train on said platform   7. Limitations   It is important to point out that although the current study makes a significant contribution through the discovery of the connection between IT adoption categories and development outcomes of microProceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 


enterprises, the researchers do not however claim that the categories of IT adoption or of development outcomes are exhaustive. The applicability of the constructs is constrained by the sample size available and the inductive process used to evaluate the sample Despite this limitation, it is also important to note that the methodology used in this study is qualitative in nature and bottom up. In other words, the results and analysis is very strongly tied to the data and the conclusions have been derived bottom-up from the data. As per Straus e coding proces s us ed  in the study allows the researchers to apply their theoretical sensitivity to make sense of the data. Future focus groups may reveal other adoption categories. But as for the IT adoption categories discovered and developed in this current study, they are heavily rooted in the data and represent the actual context from which they were extracted   8. Conclusion  Micro-enterprises are crucial contributors to the economy, both in developed as well as in developing countries. Nonetheless, research has shown that they are often ill-adapted to the technological demands of the modern economy. In this study we used inductive reasoning, coding and classification to expand upon earlier research by Qureshi et al. [2 at pu t m i croentrepreneurs into technology attitude groups. We tied these attitude groups into a conceptual model of development outcome expectations, concluding that most of the entrepreneurs had limited and specific expectations concordant with their previous limited and specific technology exposure. Finally, we made some conjectures about the kinds of interventions that would be most suitable for these entrepreneurs. Future research will focus on testing and clarifying both the aforementioned technology attitude groups and the model tying the groups to specific outcome expectations. The hope is that a robust model will facilitate successful and sustained technology interventions in the future  9.
