mining process The GDF algorithm still suffers the generateand-test approach to mine the MFFIs in a level-wise way When the dataset is a very dense one the designed fuzzylist structure becomes larger more memory usage is required to keep more MFFIs which can be observed in Fig 5\(a Overall the memory usage of the designed approaches have better performance than that of the GDF algorithm in most cases VI C ONCLUSION In the past a level-wise GDF algorithm was presented to mine the MFFIs which takes more computations to generateand-test candidates at each level In this paper an ef“cient fuzzy-list structure is presented to keep the necessary information for mining MFFIs Two pruning strategies are also designed to reduce the search space thus speeding up computations and reducing memory usage to mine MFFIs From the conducted results it can be observed that the proposed approaches outperform the state-of-the-art GDF algorithm in terms of runtime and memory usage in both real-world and synthetic datasets A CKNOWLEDGMENTS This research was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China NSFC under grant No.61503092 by Ministry of Science and Technology Taiwan R.O.C under grant no MOST 104-2632-S-424-001 and MOST 104-2221-E-230-019 R EFERENCES  R Agra w al T  Imielinski and A Sw ami Database mining A per formance perspective IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering  Vol 5\(6 pp 914-925 1993  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules in large databases The International Conference on Very Large Data Bases  pp 487-499 1994  R Agra w a l and R Srikant Mining sequential patterns The International Conference on Data Engineering  pp 3-14 1995  K C C Chan and W  H Au Mining fuzzy association rules International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management  pp 209-215 1997  M S Chen J Han and P  S Y u  Data mining An o v ervie w from a database perspective IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering  Vol 8\(6 pp 866-883 1996  SPMF An Open-Source Data Mining Library  http://www  philippe-fournier-viger.com/spmf  J Han J Pei Y  Y in and R Mao Mining frequent patterns without candidate generation A frequent-pattern tree approach Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery  Vol 8\(1 pp 53-87 2004  T  P  Hong C S K uo and S C Chi Mining association rules from quantitative data Intelligent Data Analysis  Vol 3\(5 pp 363-376 1999  T  P  Hong C W  Lin and Y  L W u  Incrementally f ast updated frequent pattern trees Expert Systems with Applications  Vol 34\(4 pp 24242435 2008  T  P  Hong G C Lan Y  H Lin and S T  P an An ef fecti v e gradual data-reduction strategy for fuzzy itemset mining International Journal of Fuzzy Systems  Vol 15\(2 pp 170-181 2013  C M K uok A Fu and M H W ong Mining fuzzy association rules in databases ACM SIGMOD Record  Vol 27\(1 pp 41-46 1998  C W  Lin T  P  Hong and W  H Lu Linguistic data mining with fuzzy fp-trees Expert Systems with Applications  Vol 37\(6 pp 4560-4567 2010  C W  Lin T  P  Hong and T  C Lin An ef cient tree-based fuzzy data mining approach International Journal of Fuzzy Systems  Vol 12\(2 pp 150-157 2010  C W  Lin T  P  Hong and W  H Lu An ef fecti v e tree structure for mining high utility itemsets Expert Systems with Applications  Vol 38\(6 pp 7419-7424 2011  C W  Lin T  P  Hong and W  H Lu Mining fuzzy frequent itemsets based on UBFFP trees Journal of Intelligent  Fuzzy Systems  Vol 27\(1 pp 535-548 2014  L A Zadeh Fuzzy sets Information and Control  8 pp 338-353 1965 2016 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems FUZZ 2119

The architecture enables discovery or interesting patterns with data from different domains related to Telecom Network Monitoring. The architecture is composed of five sub-modules: Data Analyzer, Mining Controller, Data Miner, Combiner, and Episode Analyzer. Each sub-module is described in detail along with implementation approach  functions in turn. The approach leverages and combines frequent itemset discovery over data streams, association rule learning, frequent sequential pattern mining, and frequent temporal pattern mining techniques while also making use of distributed processing platforms to achieve high-volume throughput. To test the functionality of the model, three classic pattern mining algorithms, namely, NewMoment PrefixSpan, and HTPM, are implemented Their performances are compared in terms of different parameter settings by executing the algorithms with a simulated streaming dataset Fig.10

frequent itemset mining solutions have been published in the literature see 11   1 3   28]Ð[31 The most relevant work is the privacy-preserving association rule mining solution presented in I n t hi s s ol ut i on a d at a owner known as the master is responsible for the mining The other data owners known as slaves insert ctitious transactions to their respectiv e datasets and send the datasets to the master Each data owner will also send his set of real transactions IDs to a semi-trusted third-party server The third-party server is assumed not to be colluding with any data owner but it cannot be trusted to hold the raw data The master generates association rule candidates from the joint database containing ctitious data For each rule candidate X  Y  the master sends the ID lists of the transactions containing X  Y and the transactions containing X to the third-party server The server veriÞes if the rule is qualiÞed or not Similar to our solutions a semi-trusted third-party is utilized for the mining However unlike our solutions a data owner i.e the master does the majority of the computational work Therefore we can hardly say that such a solution is an outsourced mining solution Though ctitious data are added in datasets to lower data usability the master is able to learn signiÞcant information about other data owners raw data from the received datasets In cont rast our solutions do not leak such information as we do not rely on one particular data owner to undertake the computations and we also encrypt the datasets All existing solutions with the exception of  d o not utilize a third-party server to server to compute the mining result Some solutions  13 us e a s y mmet r i c encryption to compute the supports of itemsets while other solutions 28]Ð[30 us e a s ecure s cal ar product p rot o col  a s et intersection cardinality protocol or a secret sharing scheme to perform these computations A majority of these solutions expose exact supports to all data owners resulting in the leakage of information about the data owners raw data  The only exception is one of s s o l u t i ons  I n  13 t here are two privacy-preserving solutions for frequent itemset mining The rst solution exposes exact supports which is not desirable The second solution does not expose exact supports However association rules cannot be mined based on the result of second solution because conÞdences cannot be computed without the exact supports In addition this solutionÕs method cannot be used to mine association rules because securely computing conÞdence is more complicated than computing support In comparison with this solution our frequent itemset mining solutionÕs computational complexity is signiÞcantly lower Our solutions do not expose exact supports or conÞdences to data owners Different from existing solutions based on homomorphic encryption we use symmetric homomorphic encryption instead of asymmetric homomorphic encryption and the manner in which we use homomorphic encryption also differs from existing solutions In our approach we use homomorphic encryption to create ERVs and build our secure outsourced comparison scheme B Privacy-Preserving Outsour ced Association Rule Mining and Frequent Itemset Mining Privacy-preserving outsourced frequent itemset mining and association rule mining have been studied in the setting of a single data owner  19]Ð[21 I n e xi s t i n g s ol ut i ons  the data owner outsources thei r data and the mining task to the cloud but at the same time wish to keep the raw data secret from the cloud Generally

data owner inserts ctitious transactions in the encrypted database to conceal the item frequency After inserting the ctitious transactions any item in the encrypted database will share the same

and returns the result frequent itemsets and their supports to the data owner The data owner revises these itemsets supports by subtracting them with these itemsets corresponding occurrence counts in the ctitious transactions respectively Finally the data owner decrypts the received itemsets with the revised supports higher than the frequency threshold an d generates association rules based on found frequent itemsets Our solutions use their techniques to conceal the raw data from the cloud and mitigate frequency analysis attack that can be undertaken by the cloud Using these techniques

tag schemes Another recent work  propos ed a p ri v a c y pres e rving outsourced association rule mining solution based on predicate encryption This solution is resilient to chosen-plaintext attacks on encrypted items but it is vulnerable to frequency analysis attacks Applying this solution to vertically partitioned databases will also result in the leakage of the exact supports to data owners In this paper our adversary model is different We assume the cloud has knowledge of the item frequencies instead of chosen plaintext-ciphertext pairs and our solutions are resilient to frequency analysis attacks C Other Related Work Other than the settings of vertically partitioned databases and cloud/third-party-aided mining privacy-preserving frequent itemset mining and association rule mining have

solution for vertically partitioned databases This allows the data owners to outsource mining task on their joint data in a privacy-preserving manner privacypreserving manner Based on this solution we built a privacypreserving outsourced association rule partitioned databases Our solutions protect data ownerÕs raw data from other data owners and the cloud Our solutions also ensure the privacy of the mining results from the cloud Compared with most existing solutions our solutions leak less information about the data owners raw data Our evaluation has also demonstrated that our solutions are very efÞci ent therefore our solutions are suitable to be used by data owners wishing to outsource their databases to the cloud but require a high level of privacy without compromising on performance To realize our solutions an efÞcient homomorphic encryption scheme and a secure outsourced comparison scheme were presented in this paper Both schemes have potential usage in other secure computation applications such as secure data aggregation beyond the data mining solutions described in this paper Demonstrating the u tility of the p roposed homomorphic encryption scheme and outsourced comparison scheme in other settings will be the focus of future research A PPENDIX I NSERTING F ICTITIOUS T RANSACTIONS  s A LGORITHM  An algorithm to counter frequency analysis attacks on the outsourced database encrypted with a substitution cipher was proposed in F or the purpos e o f c oncealing t he item frequency this algorithm inserts ctitious transactions in the database to be oursourced The goal is to ensure that each item share the same frequency with at least k  1 items The algorithm is summarized as follows also see  Firstly the data owner scans the database to count each individual itemÕs support  Secondly the data owner groups items considering the supports and co-occurrence of items The data owner sorts items in decreasing order of support Starting from the rst of the sorted item list i.e the item with the highest support the data owner assigns every k adjacent items to a new created group If there are less than k unassigned items remaining these items will be assigned to the last created group The data owner swaps items from different groups to ensure that all items in the same group do not occur together in the same transaction  Thirdly for each item in each group the data owner calculates the difference between the itemÕs support and the highest support in the group The difference is deÞned as the noise of the item  Fourthly to achieve k anonymity frequency the data owner generates ctitious transactions based on the result of the third step The number of an itemÕs occurrences in the ctitious transactions is equal to its noise calculated in the third step After inserting the ctitious transactions all items in the same group share the same support A CKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to thank Quach Vinh Thanh the Associate
