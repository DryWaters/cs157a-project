Improving Opportunistic Data Dissemination via Known Vector 002 Jyh-How Huang 1  Ying-Yu Chen 2  Yi-Chao Chen 2  Shivakant Mishra 3  and Ling-Jyh Chen 2 1 Department of Electronic Engineering National Taiwan University 2 Institute of Information Science Academia Sinica 3 Department of Computer Science University of Colorado Boulder Abstract An opportunistic network is a network where each node only has connectiviy with other nodes opportunistically To disseminate data in this kind of network is a challenging task and had drawn lots of research effort When two nodes have connectivity with each other the data bundles stored in their memory will be either replicated or forwarded to the other node in the hope that the data eventually reaches the destination node The protocols that has only one copy of each data bundle is catagorized as forwarding protocol while the ones with multiple copies called replicating protocols In opportunistic network the replicating protocols are preferred over forwarding protocols Yet a big overhead is to be solved for replicating routing protocols i.e the exchanging of metadata To avoid sending data bundles the other party already has replicating protocols usually exchange metadata at the beginning of the connecting period The naive method sending the data bundles index summary in the memory seems reasonable But over time this metadata exchange will become a big overhead This paper propose a new scheme of indexing data bundles in the memory and can also reduces the metadata exchanged by large extent 1 Introduction For two nodes to establish a temperarily connected link in an opportunistic network there are usually three phasese namely probing phase metadata exchanging phase and data exchanging phase Probing phase is for two nodes to discover each other this is usually done by periodically beaconing and listening Metadata exchanging phase is for two nodes to exchange the information about the data bundles they have the direction they are heading to or how much 002 This paper is based on research supported by the National Science Council of Taiwan under Grant No NSC 97-2628-E-001-007-MY3 and NSC 97-2631-S-003-003 space they have in the memory A node applies the metadata it received to the utility function for some speciﬁc goal e.g maximum delivery rate minimum average delay and decides which data bundles it wants the other node to mule for The third phase of establishing a link is the data exchanging phase In this phase either one node sends data to the other one or they exchange data bundles in turn Due to the natural charactor of opportunistic network i.e unstable wireless radio links reliable transmission and how to recover from a temperarily broken link is the main issue in this phase In replicating protocols on receiving metadata a node can decide which data bundles should be replicated and sent to the other node That is to say the time duration and energy spent of data exchanging phase is largely decided by the metadata With good metadata only necessary data bundles will be repilcated to the other node and thus the energy used to send/receive redundent data bundles is saved As important as it is metadata is rarely discussed In this paper we propose a new method to index metadata called known vector Through known vector we can save largely on the overhead of sending naive metadata repeatly Proposed to solve the problems in the realworld our protocol uses very little overhead and outperforms the traditional indexing method by a large scale In section 2 we will discuss other routing protocols for opportunistic networks In section 3 we describe in details the known vector protocol Next section 4 we will show the evaluation of the result through the simulation we did in The ONE  In section 5 we conclude the paper 2 Background Replication is the most popular design choice for opportunistic routing schemes For instance the Epidemic Routing scheme  s ends identical copies of a message simultaneously over multiple paths to mitigate the effects of a single path failure thus it increases the possibility of successful message delivery However ooding a network with

duplicate data tends to be very costly in terms of trafﬁc overhead and energy consumption To address the problem of excess trafﬁc overhead caused by ooding Harras et al proposed a Controlled Flooding scheme to reduce the ooding cost while maintaining reliable message delivery  I n t his s cheme ooding is controlled by three parameters namely willingness probability  Time-to-Live  and Kill Time  Additionally once a message has been delivered to the receiver successfully a Passive Cure is generated to heal the nodes in the network that have been infected by the message Therefore by removing the excess trafﬁc overhead problem while providing reliable data delivery controlled ooding can substantially reduce the network overhead Node mobility also impacts on the effectiveness of opportunistic routing schemes Previous studies have shown that if the network mobility departs from the well-known random way-point mobility model e.g the Pursue Mobility Model o r t he Reference Point Group Mobility Model  the o v e rhead carried by epidemicand/or oodingbased routing schemes can be further reduced by considering node mobility For instance the Probabilistic Routing scheme  calculates the delivery predictability from a node to a particular destination node based on the observed contact history and forwards a message to its neighboring node if and only if that neighboring node has a higher delivery predictability value The scheme was revised by Leguay et al  by taking the mobility pattern into account i.e a message is forwarded to a neighbor node if and only if that node has a mobility pattern more similar to the destination node 10 s ho w t hat the r e v ised mobility pattern scheme is more effective than previous schemes Another class of opportunistic network routing schemes is based on encoding techniques which transform a message into a different format prior to transmission For instance an integration of network coding and epidemic routing techniques has been proposed to reduce the required number of transmissions in a network and 15 proposes combining erasure coding and the simple replicationbased routing method to improve data delivery for the worst delay performance cases in opportunistic networks Following the concept of erasure coding-based data forwarding  an Estimation based Erasure-Coding routing scheme EBEC has been proposed to adapt the delivery of erasure coded blocks using the Average Contact Frequency ACF estimate  M oreo v e r  6 p roposes a h ybrid scheme called HEC that combines the strength of erasure coding and the advantages of Aggressive Forwarding  The HEC scheme has been further enhanced by employing the techniques of sequential forwarding i.e HEC-SF probabilistic forwarding i.e HEC-PF fully interlea ving i.e HEC-FI  and block-based interlea ving i.e HEC-BI  3 Meta-Message Exchange Approaches When two nodes encounter they usually need to exchange some meta-messages to avoid sending duplicate messages that the other node already has Many protocols apply a scheme which we call Summary Vector  A summary vector is the vector which comprises all identiﬁers of messages in the buffer of a node An identiﬁer of a message is unique for each message in the whole network A replicating protocol usually requires summary vector exchanging to avoid sending/receiving redundant data bundles But exchanging the summary vector repeatedly can cause a large overhead Therefore we propose a scheme Known Vector  to alleviate the overhead introduced by the Summary Vector scheme The Known Vector scheme can be considered as a pre-processor that can eliminate unnecessary identiﬁers of messages in a summary vector Every protocol using the Summary Vector scheme can apply our Known Vector scheme to get better performance For evaluation we choose to apply the Known Vector scheme to the Epidemic Routing protocol and compare it with the original Epidemic Routing protocol with the pure Summary Vector scheme In section 3.1 we provide an overview of the Epidemic Routing protocol to brieﬂy explain how the Summary Vector scheme works in this protocol The proposed Known Vector scheme is explained in section 3.2 3.1 Epidemic Routing This section provides an overview of the Epidemic Routing protocol In Epidemic Routing the buffer of each node consists of messages originated by this node as well as messages relayed on behalf of other nodes Each node also carries a summary vector which comprises all identiﬁers of the messages in its buffer When two nodes encounter they exchange the summary vector with each other After receiving the summary vector from the encountering node a node compares the received summary vector to its own summary vector and then requests the messages that are not in its buffer In this paper we call a request for messages as a request vector We denote the buffer of node x as BUF x  A summary vector and a request vector sent from node x to node y are denoted as SV x,y and RV x,y respectively The following is an example of what two nodes do when they encounter Suppose that before encounter node i has messages M 1  M 2  and M 3  BUF i   M 1 M 2 M 3   and node j has messages M 3  M 4  and M 5  BUF j   M 3 M 4 M 5   When they encounter node i generates a summary vector SV i,j   M 1 M 2 M 3  for node j  and node j generates a summary vector SV j,i   M 3 M 4 M 5  for node i  After exchanging summary vectors node i request messages M 4 and M 5 by computing a request vector RV i,j  SV j,i  BUF i  and node j re

quest messages M 1 and M 2 by computing a request vector RV j,i  SV i,j  BUF j  Suppose they have sufﬁcient time to transmit all requested messages Both node i and node j have 5 messages  M 1 to M 5  after their encounter 3.2 The Proposed Approach Known Vector While summary vector can be viewed as node based approach known vector can be viewed as message based approach In known vector every message in a node keeps a vector which is a list of node IDs those already have this message this node know of Note that this vector is not an accurate global network knowledge The known vector can be regarded as metadata of a message and is duplicated and sent with the message The known vectors of replicates in different nodes of one message might not be the same due to different relaying paths The copy of a message M k resides in node x is denoted as M k,x  and the known vector of this copy is denoted as KV M k,x  Initially a message M k originated by node x doesn’t have any record in its known vector M k,x  i.e  KV M k,x    When two nodes encounter they will take the following steps when node i and node j encounter the state of node i is BUF i   M 1 M 2   KV M 1 i   m j n   KV M 2 i   a b   and the state of node j is BUF j   M 3 M 1   KV M 3 j   a   KV M 1 j   m   1 Generate and exchange summary vectors Node x generates SV x,y that contains message IDs of those whose known vector doesn’t include y The algorithm of generating a summary vector is shown in Algorithm 1.For the example the summary vector SV i,j contains M 2 only but SV j,i   M 3 M 1   2 Send a request Node x generates RV x,y  SV y,x  BUF x  e.g RV i,j   M 3   and RV j,i   M 2   3 Transmit messages requested For every message M k transmitted from node x to node y  node x rstly duplicates M k,x as M 002 k,x including KV M k,x  After transmitting M 002 k,x to node y  node x adds y into KV M k,x  After receiving M 002 k,x  node y saves it in the buffer as M k,y with KV M k,y  KV M 002 k,x 003 x   For the example after node i transmits M 002 2 i to node j  KV M 2 i becomes  a b j   and node j saves M 002 2 i as M 2 j with KV M 2 j   a b i  Also after node j transmits M 002 3 j  KV M 3 j becomes  a i   and node i saves M 002 3 j as M 3 i with KV M 3 i   a j   4 Update known vectors Node x can infer that node y already has messages in the set SV x,y  RV y,x because node y is supposed to request every message in SV x,y unless it already has Algorithm 1 Summary vector generation of node x when it encounters node y in the Known Vector scheme Require x 004  y Ensure SV x,y SV x,y 005 for all messages M k,x in the buffer of node x do if ynot in KV M k,x then SV x,y 005 SV x,y 003 y  end if end for Table 2 The properties of the two network scenarios Trace Name ZebraNet iMote Device N/A iMote Network Type N/A Bluetooth Duration days 16 3 Devices participating 34 274 Number of contacts 31,693 28,217 Avg  Contacts/pair/day 3.53086 0.12574 that message Therefore node x adds y into the known vector of every message in the set SV x,y  RV y,x For example node j can infer that node i already has M 1  and then KV M 1 j becomes  m i   Table 1 shows all situations for a message M k which resides in node i when node i encounters node j  The second column shows whether the known vector of the copy of message M k in node i denoted as K M k,i  contains j The third column shows whether node j also has message M k denoted as M k,j  and if node j already has M k,j  whether the known vector of M k,j contains i is shown in the fourth column Explanations about situations are shown in the fth column 4 Evaluation We now evaluate the performance in terms of the delivery ratio and trafﬁc overhead of the Summary Vector SV scheme and the proposed Known Vector KV scheme using a Java-based simulator called The ONE  We evaluated two network scenarios based on realistic wireless network traces namely the ZebraNet and iMote  traces w hich are publicly a v ailable f or research purposes and correspond to the opportunistic wildlife network and people network scenarios Table 2 outlines the basic properties of the network scenarios In each simulation run the source and the destination pair was randomly selected from all participating peers and the source peer transmitted messages in the rst 10 of the

3 CONCLUSIONS A reference design for a system in which both the processed data uplink PDU and the sensor data SD downlink can coexist within the 8175-8400 MHz band is shown to be achievable with a single antenna using QPSK modulation for the SD downlink and 8PSK modulation for the PD uplink The design described here uses a TPC for forward error correction coding to close the link with adequate margin Self-interference from the SD downlink to the PDU on the GOES-R satellite is shown to be about 13 dB below the tolerable interference level 4 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors thank Drs Jim Yoh Eugene Grayver and Joseph Leong of The Aerospace Corporation Communications and Networking Division for their input REFERENCES NONE BIOGRAPHY Dr Srini Raghavan has over 30 years of experience in the design simulation and analysis of satellite communication systems spread-spectrum systems and signal processing Currently he is supporting several communication systems and Global Positioning System GPS activities at The Aerospace Corporation where he is a Senior Engineering Specialist He also has taught a number of in-house courses on digital communications and spreadspectrum systems He has an M.S and a Ph.D in electrical engineering from the University of Missouri-Rolla and is a Senior Member of IEEE and a member of ION Eta Kappa Nu and Sigma Xi he joined RCA in West Los Angeles where he became Supervisor of the Transmitter and Microwave Section He was engaged in systems analyses at The Rand Corporation from 1960 through 1978 and joined The Aerospace Corporation in 1981 Mr Samuel Lim currently serves as the Director of Development for the Communications and Networking Division CND He is responsible for coordinating civil and commercial C&C new business activities managing the IR&D program stewarding the knowledge management applications and formulating strategy to address emerging opportunities for the division Mr Lim earned a B.S in electrical engineering from UCLA in 1987 an M.S in electrical engineering from UCLA in 1988 and an MBA degree from UCLA in 2000 Mr Lim is a member of IEEE and AIAA has published a number of technical papers and was granted two patents Dr Donald Olsen has been with The Aerospace Corporation since 1974 Most recently he has been working on the Transformational Satellite Communications System Waveforms He has pioneered the emphasis on GMSK turbo codes and hybrid interleaving for use in various programs including STSS He invented the hybrid interleaver for packet compatible survivable communications Dr Olsen was the principal author of the Aerospace Generic Communications Waveform and the major contributor to the SDI Communications Standards Dr Olsen is currently doing support analysis simulation NTIA spectrum management activities in connection with several programs Dr Olsen is a delegate to the CCSDS organization on its frequency and modulation panel coding panel security panel and compression working groups Dr Olsen is a graduate of California State Polytechnic University BSEL Brigham Young University MSEE and Purdue University Ph.D in electrical engineering where his specialty was radio communications Mr Feldman attended the University of California at Berkeley where he received the BSEE in 1948 and the MSEE in 1950 In 1951 he was employed by the University of California Radiation Laboratory where he was responsible for the RF system design used in the Heavy-ion Linear Accelerators at UC Berkeley and Yale University In 1956 9

I r Z  Figure 9 A Military Modeling and Simulation Configuration of the Ilium Framework To do that we have assembled a collection of trusted military simulations that span the range of such applications from fine-grained simulations that focus on detailed interactions between two entities to coarse-grained simulations of military campaigns Figure 9 illustrates the Ilium Framework configured to accommodate those simulations as well as representative prototype systems In this case the legacy applications are simulations analysis systems and design tools Prototypes are notional UAV autopilots route planners decision support systems and similar applications The Framework augments these applications with control objects and agents that coordinate computations in the composed system and specialize agents that typically represent the characteristics of a new system or technology that cannot be easily or adequately simulated in any of the component legacy systems In our current study the following systems have Ilium Framework plugins and are used as components in the study environment 12 Al f<cOmmi.ain FIa 1A  


THUNDER is a campaign simulation that models national military forces and military operations that extend over months 30  Characteristics of individual systems are evaluated statistically and their effects on the overall campaign are not explicitly known Political social and cultural objects and concepts are not included in the model In this configuration THUNDER is used to generate force level tasking mission orders and to evaluate and adjust for the results of missions with respect to campaign plans SEAS is a force level simulation that simulates battles between major forces in combat operations that typically last for hours and as much as a day SEAS features a flexible rules based decision logic that can influence behavior at both the commander and individual combatant level SEAS executes the missions requested by THUNDER and provides a manageable dynamic context for examining the behavior of prototypes in a range of typical operational situations  31 A dynamic plug-in supports interaction with the Framework and other pugged-in components EADSIM is a trusted model of air defense systems that is in particular sensitive to many important design attributes of individual systems In certain modified forms it can reference advanced sensor and engagement decision models In our study configuration EADSIM simulates enemy air defenses in selected e.g significant to our investigation portions of the virtual battle A dynamic plug-in supports system control as well as interaction with the Framework and other pugged-in components A prototype aircraft mission planning system plug-in supports virtual real time mission plan creation and updates In particular the system provides automatic route planning for selected platforms that have been assigned missions by THUNDER and that are subsequently executed in simulation in SEAS and EADSIM The Ilium Framework itself provides software agents that are used to model notional or experimental UAV characteristics and behaviors Depending on the objectives of a particular study the Framework may also provide agents that address advanced Command and Control concepts to coordinate the interaction of the various component systems We maintain a semantic consistency among the plugged-in component applications by developing a single operational scenario as initial input for a study and deriving the necessary application configuration data from that source We create an RDF model of the scenario based on the Ilium suite of ontologies that includes political context issues objectives sensitivities etc military context centers of gravity campaign objectives etc geophysical environment military units order of battle unit equipment lists etc command and control assets platforms weapons ISR systems etc Figure 11 below is an excerpt from an operational scenario set in the Southwest U.S depicting a description of an Air Force Wing assigned to a notional Joint Task Force The Wing is based at Bishop Air Base and has six Fighter Squadrons assigned to it Additional detail about each of those squadrons as well as the base is found in the model in this case an rdf:resource  associated with it morg:AirForceWing rdf:ID="USAF_366 Air_Exp Wg dc:creator>Doug Holmes</dc:creator mgeo:basedAt rdf:resource="#BishopAB geo:positionedAt rdf:resource="#BishopAB_pos morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF 390_Ftr_Sq morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF_494_Ftr_Sq dc date I 0/20/07</dc date morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF_496 Ftr_Sq rdfs:comment>366 AEW F-22 F-15 KC-135 130]</rdfs:comment morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF 389_Ftr_Sq morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF 391 Ftr_Sq morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF 495_Ftr_Sq rdfs:label>366 Air Expeditionary Wing</rdfs:label morg:AirForceWing ab9 7P.b ii uI1 L L CFigure 11 An RDF model of a notional USAF Wing Figure 12 is another excerpt from the same scenario illustrating a model of a particular Fighter Squadron and one of the F-15E aircraft it operates Figure 10 Legacy Components in the Ilium Framework 13 suka

aircraft Note that these models also have associated SEAS models that contain information peculiar to the SEAS simulation about these entities This information is used to configure SEAS to properly represent these particular entities We are also able to insert objects and information that may be of interest in our study that is not represented in any of the component simulations or other applications Where those objects are related to an object that is simulated that relationship permits inferences about the effects on them as a result of actions that are computed in a simulation For example it is possible to indicate that GeorgeAB defends the capital city and lend special significance to the actions of aircraft that are based there even though none of the simulations in the composite system have any notion of capital city Finally the operational scenario provides an explicit record of the assumptions that underly the study and can also include and explicit representation of system and study goals This practice improves analysis and may enable future knowledge based analytical tools Throughout the process of constructing the operational scenario and when it is complete we use one or more Description Logic Reasoners to ensure the logical consistency of the the model A number of these automatic theorem provers are freely available including Pellet 32 33 FaCT  34 and OWLIM 35 are used in the Framework to compute logical entailments and to complete RDF models as well as to ensure the consistency of models In the later capacity frequent checks will identify errors in the construction some e.g Pellet also indicate the source of the error and aid in repairing it As a result we are confident that the operational scenario is a sound model The primary use of the Reasoners allows us to significantly extend the explicit RDF model that is created For example a squadron is explicitly specified as assignedTo a wing and that relationship is the inverse of assignedOrg then the system can infer that the wing has the squadron as an assigned organization even though that fact has never been asserted Similarly if the same relationship is defined as a transitive relationship it is possible to infer that a flight that is assigned to the squadron is also assigned to the wing Once we have an operational scenario that has been classified by a Reasoner we then use the completed model to configure the composite system Ilium and the pluggedin systems to execute the simulation We use SPARQL a W3C standard query language designed to access RDFL to extract data from the scenario to create the input files needed to configure the various applications.[36 SELECT name pos long lat alt vis W1HLERE name rdf:type mast SeasLocation name geo:positionedAt pos pos pos:long long pos pos:lat lat pos pos:alt alt name msim:Visible vis  Figure 13 A typical SPARQL query In a similar fashion SPARQL is used to extract data from the scenario to create the necessary Ilium java surrogate control and agents SPARQL can also be used to review the scenario and answer questions that have arisen since the inception of the study At this point we are able execute the scenario with confidence that it will produce reliable results 7 CONCLUSIONS We have developed a methodology and supporting tools for creating an operational scenario that supports the semantic interoperability of an ad hoc collection of legacy applications and extends their capabilities The method depends on and ensures the logical integrity of the composite system Therefore when we assemble as a collection of legacy component systems that were not originally intended to interoperate with other systems we can be confidant that the composite system will produce consistent results Logical consistency implies that to the degree that we trust the interpretation underlying the model the results of operations on the model are trustworthy If for example the model is based on a Newtonian interpretation of physics the model ought to provide reliable answers to questions about automotive and even aeronautical engineering but probably not to all questions in astronomy or cosmology This methodology extends the utility of trusted simulations allowing integration of finegrained simulations that are sensitive to design requirements with high level coarse-grained simulations that are sensitive to acquisition issues and policy The potential benefits of 14 


this sort of interoperation may range from obvious production efficiencies to clearer insights into system requirements Finally an important side-effect of the approach is the OWL/RDF knowledge base formed by the combination of the operational scenario and the results of the operations of the legacy systems That knowledge base and the use of SPARQL queries and SWRL rules effectively expands the functionality of the system and greatly improves the analysis of the output of the system of cooperating simulations and tools We have prepared a foundation for the application of Semantic Web and other knowledge based tools in the analysis and design of unmanned systems We anticipate the development and application of these tools and the addition of autonomy directed Multiple Agent Systems MAS that use RDF/XML inter-agent communications in the coming year REFERENCES 1 NAFCAM 2001 Exploiting EManufacturing:Ineroperability of Software Systems Used by U.S Manufacturers available at 12 Protege Ontology Editor documentation available at http proteae.stanf6rd.edu 13 Top Braid Composer Datasheet available at 14 W and Nicola Guarino 2001 Support for Ontological Analysis of Taxonomic Relationships J Data and Knowled 39\(1 October 2001 15 Natalya F Noy and Deborah L McGuinness Ontology Development 10 1 A Guide to Creating Your First Ontology  Stanford University Stanford CA 94305 16 Alan Rector Modularisation of Domain Ontologies Implemented in Description Logics and related formalisms including OWL K-CAP'03 October 23-25 2003 Sanibel Island Florida USA pp 121-8 2003 17 Cyc Homepage available at htc.c 18 Open Cyc home page available at 19 SUMO Description and Home Page available at 19 SENSUS Description and Home Page available at 2 Bemers-Lee Tim Hendler Jim Lasilla Ora The Semantic Web Scientific American available at 20 DOLCE A Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering ontology and documents available at 3 Bemers-Lee Tim Blog on Design Issues available at 4 RDF Primer available at s chema/#ref-rdf-primer 5 Lacey Lee OWL Representing Information Using the Web Ontology Language Trafford Publishing 2005 6 OWL Web Ontology Language Guide available at Jten pHomewPage availal adt 7 Jena Home Page available at 8 Protege Home Page available at h1ttp  protegest nftanford.edu,X 1 9 Baader Calvanese McGuiness Nardi and PatelSchnieder Description Logic Handbook 10 Oberle Daniel Semantic Management of Middleware Springer 2006 OWL Web Ontology Language Guide available at 21 Nicola Gauarino Claudio Masolo Stefano Borgo Aldo Gangemi and Alessandro Oltramari Ontology Infrastructure for the Semantic Web Wonder World Deliverable DI 8 Laboratory for Applied Ontology Trento Italy 2001 available on line at ht X1t1 22 DUL.owl ontology available at www.1oa23t og DLl 23 Amy Knutilla Steven Polyak Craig Schlenoff Austin Tate Shu Chiun Cheah Steven Ray and Richard Anderson Process Specification Language An Analysis of Existing Representations NIST report available at http llwww.mel.nlist.gov/msid.librarZ/d.oc/psl-1 _.df 24 Process Specification Language Ontology available at http-//www,55,me l.nit gov/psl 25 Ontology for Geography Markup Language GML3.0 owl ontology available at ok i.cae.drexel.edu./-wbs/onltology/2004/09/ogc-gmI1 26 Ontology for Geography Markup Language GML3.0 of Open GIS Consortium OGC Home Page available at 15

Prior to coming to the Georgia Institute of Technology \(GTRI\ in 2003, Chris was a BMEWS Radar hardware manager for the US Air Force and at MITRE and Xontech he was responsible for radar performance analysis of PAVE PAWS, BMEWS and PARCS UHF radar systems Chris is an accomplished radar-systems analyst familiar with all hardware and software aspects of missile-tracking radar systems with special expertise related to radar cueing/acquisition/tracking for ballistic missile defense ionospheric effects on UHF radar calibration and track accuracy, radar-to-radar handover, and the effects of enhanced PRF on radar tracking accuracy.  At GTRI, Chris is responsible for detailed analysis of ground-test and flight-test data and can be credited with improving radar calibration, energy management, track management, and atmospheric-effects compensation of Ballistic Missile Defense System radars   Paul D. Burns received his Bachelor of Science and Masters of Science in Electrical Engineering at Auburn University in 1992 and 1995 respectively. His Master\222s thesis research explored the utilization of cyclostationary statistics for performing phased array blind adaptive beamforming From 1995 to 2000 he was employed at Dynetics, Inc where he performed research and analysis in a wide variety of military radar applications, from air-to-air and air-toground pulse Doppler radar to large-scale, high power aperture ground based phased array radar, including in electronic attack and protection measures. Subsequently, he spent 3 years at MagnaCom, Inc, where he engaged in ballistic missile defense system simulation development and system-level studies for the Ground-based Midcourse defense \(GMD\ system. He joined GTRI in 2003, where he has performed target tracking algorithm research for BMD radar and supplied expertise in radar signal and data processing for the Missile Defense Agency and the Navy Integrated Warfare Systems 2.0 office.  Mr. Burns has written a number of papers in spatio-temporal signal processing, sensor registration and target tracking, and is currently pursuing a Ph.D. at the Georgia Institute of Technology  


  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs.
