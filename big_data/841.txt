In this paper an algorithm for the real-tim e estimation and compensation of the moving target Doppler shift due to the moving radar platform and target is presented for the airborne stepped frequency radar system. Under the condition of a small number of sample points, this new algorithm employs the 
twice compensation method in order to estimate and compensate the mean Doppler shift using high speed DSP based on Doppler FFT processing. Using simulated radar data, the moving target Doppler spectrum is measured and analyzed. The results of simulations show that this new algorithm can reduce the number of sample points and enhance the anti-interfering performance yet still obtain good Doppler estimation and compensation Keywords  Airborne radar, Doppler compensation, Doppler shift adaptive compen sation, twice compensation algorithm stepped frequency pulse 1 2   T ABLE OF C ONTENTS  1

function of a target as the radar platform and target move relative to one another. Even though the rotational motion of airborne radar relative to the target is an indispensable factor in radar imaging, translational target and radar motion introduce unwanted phase distortions in the frequency  A few methods have been introduced to compensate for this unwanted phase distortion The method of rational orthogonal wavelets  i s  compatible with our proposed Doppler compensation 1  1 978-1-4244-2622-5 09/$25.00 \2512009 IEEE 2 IEEEAC paper #1424, Version 10 Updated November 26, 2008 structure and achieves good system performance.

compensation that uses phase to estimate radar platform and target motion parameters under the condition of a smaller number sample points. This algorithm is presented with the description of the real-time Doppler spectral estimation and compensation. The anti-inte rfering performance of this algorithm is good.

But the velocity estimation accuracy is not ideal for many algorithms when the number of sample point is less. But the new algorithm which is advanced by this paper is different. The steps of this new compensation algorithm for target Doppler shift are below 002\006\002 002 002 0 2 005  fN c r 007\002  8  This formula is maximum velocity variable cell for compensating simple phase term If the un-distortion condition of echo is that the phase variety of the twice phase term is not more than 2 002 needs to be satisfied with formula \(8 r t TNf c v 0 1 4   c kTvRfkf t k 2 2 0 0   c t v r Tff e 2 0 002 This frequency produces Doppler shift in di fferent pulse repetition time Next the formula \(4 analyzed by simulation The effects of relative radar platform and target motion on the target echo are shown in Fig.1. From this figure we observe that as the relative ve locity increases, the distortion also increases. Next the velo city compensation rule is considered and a new algorithm is proposed 3 VELOCITY COMPENSATION RULE  From the previous section we know target echo produces shift and defocusing when radar platform and target relative motion exists. So we need velocity compensation, which is based on velocity compensation rule. This section mainly considers the accuracy of Doppler shift estimation Supposing the relative velocity is t v so the high resolution cell number of echo shift is cNTv rt 2 The simple phase term produces range coupled e rror, which is described as 5 f f r T t v e R 002\007\002 2 1  7  where 212 0  2  where 0 R is original range r T is pulse repetition time . For the k th pulse, the phase is \(3    vTff c R r e e 006\002  005  6  When compensating for sample sequence, the range coupled error is described as formula 7\if range shift size is not more than half high range resolution cell   rR e 002 needs to be satisfied with formula \(9 2 2 2 2 005 which is formula \(6 003 003 007\006 002 006\002 r t NT c v fN  9  The formula \(9\ as formula \(10 r t fTN c v 002 212 212 002  003 003 003 003 004  4  where the first two terms are constant. The third term is simple phase term, which is formed by fundamental frequency 0 f This frequency produces a Doppler shift in different pulse repetition time. The fourth term is twice phase term, which is formed by fk 002  0   5  The corresponding echo time delay error is e

The searching range is decided by velocity estimation v     cR r iTcvcR i f 2 222 1 t  t 212 0 0  where n is natural number 4\ of n papers of target profiles is computed. Then the final signal is output, whose SNR is maximal Next utilizing statistic methods the effect of sample point number and SNR on velocity estimation accuracy is analyzed. Supposing N is invariable and the SNR are respectively 30dB, 20dB, 10dB, 5dB, the relation of velocity estimation value and real velocity value are shown in Fig.2. From this figure we know noise almost do not effect estimation accuracy when SNR is equal or more than 20dB. So the anti-interfering performance of this new algorithm is advanced Supposing SNR is 20dB through a great deal of simulations the relations of velocity estimation value and real velocity value are show n in Fig.3. In this figure N  respectively are 32, 64, 128 and 256.  We know usually the lower is the velocity estimati on accuracy the shorter is the length of sample sequence. But from this Fig.3 we know although the length of the sample sequence is various the effect of N on this new algorithm is not serious. So this algorithm can obtain better velocity estimation accuracy under the condition of fe wer sample points 5  S IMULATION FOR COMPENSATION ALGORITHM  For further analyzing the performance of this new algorithm, the actual example is shown next Supposing radar platform and target are static and the length of sample sequence is 64, by IFFT the echo sample sequence is transformed into time domain, which is shown in Fig.4. Now supposing the relative velocity between radar platform and target is 302m/s, after IFFT the echo sample sequence is transformed into time domain, which is shown in Fig.5. Using the new algorithm of this paper and computing the preliminary ve locity estimation value by formula \(14\the result value is m/s8635.303 0 210 002 is confirmed. The velocity estimation accuracy of radar system decides the velocity stepped size. Supposing v 002 is velocity stepped size, these two parameters need to be satisfied with formula \(15 vv  r vNT cl  v So the preliminary velocity estimation error is 1.86m/s \(which is obtained by 303.8635m/s-302m/s\the signal is compensated by 0 210 v The result is shown in Fig.6. Although the result is satisfied with ve locity compensation rule, the error is relatively bigger. So the next accurate estimation is essential. Supposing m/s2.0  n we can obtain 4 figures of compensated target echo signal, which are shown in Fig.6. In the case of the same noise outputting the final signal whose SNR is maximal From Fig.7 we know \(b the final outputting signal whose SNR is maximal and the velocity estimation value is 302.2m/s. Estimation error is 0.2m/s, which is in the range of estimation accuracy demand So when the length of sample sequence is short, this new algorithm is effective. If the length of sample sequence is long enough, this new algorithm is not needed 6  C ONCLUSIONS  A new algorithm for estimation and compensation of Doppler shift due to moving ra dar platform and target is proposed and described for improving the performance of the conventional compensation method. By actual data simulation the target echo signal Doppler spectrum is measured and analyzed in the term of fewer sample points It can be concluded that this new algorithm possesses good  ts 2 whose base band phase of sub-pulse respectively are 1 212 212 005 003\b 12  Accordingly the pulse phase difference is c r vNT i f 002 v Selecting 2  t v so m/s8.0 t is velocity estimation accuracy and v t and preliminary velocity estimation value is 0 210 v According to experience the searching range is 002=\002 005 2 So the number of the delay range resolution cell is described as \(13   ts 1 and b and 2 b They are described as formula \(11\and formula 12  vnvvnv 002 005 and the delay range is 002 002  2 2 0 210   14  2\ stepped size v 002 the time delay is c r vNT 2  c fN r vT fNc l r l n  212 212 005 003\b  11     cR r TNicvcR i f 2 222 2 002  002 002  002 002 002 2 2 2  13  From formula \(13\inary velocity estimation expressions \(14 fN r T nc v

the primary and secondary attributes. E.g. in the simulation, we derive the attribute distance from the secondary attribute location to estimate the distance between the sensor and CADAMULE. This primary, secondary and discovered context attributes change based on situations hence requiring recomputation of the cost formula Based on our developed cost formula and additional context discovery model, we present a simulation result in which we compute the confidence value needed by CADAMULE to decide on data collection. We also compute the energy spent by the sensor node by comparing our approach with tradition fixed sink based approach. We run our simulation based on the real Mulle sensor node by simulating its sleep, idle, listening Bluetooth search and transmit state. We also assume that the Bluetooth sensor node can control the power it spends by limiting its visibility range hence making it less visible but more energy efficient. We simulate this feature and would like to implement this on the Mulle as a part of our future work This simulated Mulle sensor node adapts its power output based on context information. Our power values are simulated based on real world values obtained from the Mulle V2 sensor node presented in this section. We run our simulation based on the following context attributes  Attribute Type Signal Strength Primary Battery power  \(on sensor node and mobile device Primary Attenuation Primary Location, Calendar Secondary Table 7: Primary and Secondary attributes for context aware mobile device based data collection  The simulation has been developed using Microsoft.net. We assume that data to the sink is delivered by using existing mobile access network like GPRS or GSM based services Each simulation run lasts for 3 minutes during which each sensor node changes its state from sleep, idle and listening transmitting data every 30 seconds. We simulate the fixed sink based approach using traditional Bluetooth discover, establish connection and transmit states with the nodes waking up in the same interval as the simulation using CADAMULE. The simulation is to primarily validate our theory of discovery of context attributes at runtime and how this can improve the overall efficiency of the system and to validate our cost formula which is based on our runtime context discovery theory. In our context aware approach, we compute the energy spent by the sensor node as a function of size of data, time taken to transfer the data, distance and retransmissions due to weak signals. We use a fixed value of 7.4 Watts as the overall power supplied by the battery equipped with the Bluetooth sensor node. We are not looking at the battery power consumed by any sensor mounted as this will have a huge influence in the results. E.g. GPS based sensors require more battery power and also would communicate more frequently updating location information The simulation results are shown in figure 7 and 8 showing some screen dumps of the simulations and a graph plotting the amount of energy spent by each node. We can see that the use of CADAMULE for data collection conserves energy to a fair extent when compared to a fixed sink based approach   Fig. 7.

Simulation Results of power consumed with fixed sink and context aware Data Mules approach VI  C ONCLUSION  The paper has presented the use of context aware mobile data mules \(CADAMULES\ as data collectors to achieve efficient data collection within a sensor network infrastructure The use of mobility for data collection is not a new approach but our proposal presents a context aware approach aiming at improving the data collection efficiency. The paper has extended the Context Spaces theory by dynamically discovering context at runtime. By using dynamic discovery of context while reasoning under uncertainty, the system can increase the confidence in the occurrence of a specific situation. We have proposed an algorithm that uses graph theory and a heuristic search to identify new context attributes that are related to the existing situation which aids in our reasoning process The paper has also presented our incorporation of the context model with dynamic discovery of context attribute into our proposed CADAMULE approach helping the mule to arrive at intelligent and smart data collection decisions. The cost formula computed from dynamic context discovery aids in arriving at cost efficient data collection. We have validated our extended context spaces theory by showing how our approach of context discovery at run time increases the confidence during reasoning process. We have also evaluated our CADAMULE approach by a simulation which uses the extended context spaces approach as a foundation to developing our dynamic cost formula. The simulation results have shown the performance gain in power consumed by the Mulle sensor node using our smart CADAMULE approach R EFERENCES  1   Y D a vi d C u l l er  D e b or a h E s t r i n Ma ni B  Sr i va s t a va  O v er vi e w  o f  s e n s or  networks, IEEE Computer, 2004, vol 37, Pages\(s\:41-49 2   C h i e nC h ung S h e n  C h av al i t  S r i s at h a po r n ph at  a n d C h ai po r n J a i k aeo   Sensor information networking architecture and applications.

A filter lag or so-called cluster tracking can easily result in a 5% or greater offset and degraded consistency.  After 300 seconds the curves peak up because the target is appr oaching a low-elevation beampoint limit.  This occurs anytime a target is tracked into the edge of the radar\222s field of re gard and can lead to radar-toradar handover difficulty         300 300 80  s D 2 k,1 k y    s D 2 k,1 k y   100 150 200 250 10 1                    10 5 1 0  Figure 8 - Consistency versus distance from beam center Monopulse Mismatch The next set of curves plotted in Figure 9 show the sensitivity of detection-primitive consistency to a mismatch in the monopulse slope.  All of these curves were generated using a linear monopulse response derived from the slope of the true monopulse response at beam center.  The slope of the 80% curve is 0.8 times th e beam-center slope; the 90 curve is 0.9 times the beam-center slope; and so on for 100%, 110% and 120%.  Again, the order of curves in the graph is the same as the legend order A steep slope tends to expand y I 222s uncertainty while a gentle slope tends to compress it.  An expanded uncertainty leads to a smaller consistency while a compressed uncertainty leads to a larger consistency.  This behavior can be observed in the family of curves in Figure 9.  Curves for the steeper slopes are on the botto m while curves for more gentle slopes are on top.  The notable feature of this set of curves is that the sensitivity to a mismatch in the monopulse slope is not very significant       100 150 200 250 10 1                    90 100 110 120  Figure 9 - Consistency versus monopulse mismatch Range-Bias Error The complex nature of the monopulse radar models presents ample opportunity to introduce errors in the software implementation.  One such e rror introduced in a \275 rangecell-width bias in the detection-primitive range which in turn resulted in a significant degradation to 2 9 k D The fact that 2 9 k D is measured in different coordinates compared to the bias made it difficult to determine which value or algorithm was to blame.  Examining the intermediate consistency values led directly to the error source A comparison between biased 2 1 k D  2 2 k D and 2 3 k D values and unbiased 2 2 k D values is shown in Figure 10.  The unbiased 2 2 k D is the bottom-most curve and the biased 2 3 k D is the top-most curve with a value around 80.  This large value for 2 3 k D indicates that there is a lot more uncertainty in the range measur ements compared to what is predicted by the range varian ce.  Since the range-variance calculation is easy to confirm, the problem must be in the algorithms that model or manipulate range A notable feature of Figure 10 is the sensitivity of the centroiding algorithm to range bias in the detection primitives.  The range bias is ba rely noticeable in the biased 2 1 k D and 2 2 k D curves.  Of course, if the unbiased 2 2 k D  curve existed as a baseline it would be relatively easy to spot the error

As previously promised, the effects and corrections for atmospheric refr action and sensor bias have been disabled so that 2 8 k D can be analyzed using a sliding window.  Of course the full analysis would include these effects and 2 8 k D at each time step would be collected and averaged over many trials Plots of the effect of changing process noise in a nearlyconstant-velocity filter are shown in Figure 12 and Figure 13 for Cartesian position and velocity respectively.  In both figures, the plotted values have been divided by 3 so that the desired value is always 1.  Increasing the process noise up to a point should increase the updated uncertainty and reduce 2 8 k D values.  Except near th e end of the trajectory when the measurements are off of beam center, the curves in Figure 12 and Figure 13 appear inconclusive for this expected trend If 2 8 k D values are way out of range there are additional intermediate filter values that can be examined.

Analyzing covariance consistency is applicable to radar systems both in the field and in simulations.  The primary challenge in both arenas comes down to properly accounting for the true target states that contribute to detections, detection primitives measurements, and state estimates For a fielded radar syst em, achieving covariance consistency is usually a s econdary consideration behind achieving and maintaining track s.  Indeed, until recently radar specifications did not even include requirements for covariance consistency.  Recent covariance consistency requirements stem from the fact that the use of radar systems in sensor netting applications is on the rise Currently the combined e ffects of off-beam-center measurements, atmospheric correction, bias correction clustering and centrioding, data association, and filtering on state covariance consistency throughout a target\222s trajectory are not well known.  This is particularly true for radars using wideband waveforms and multiple hypotheses or multiple frame trackers.  Numerical results presented here indicate that algorithms early in the radar signal processing chain can significantly degrad e covariance consistency and that some errors are better tolerated than others For a simulated target in a modeled system, truth relative to some global reference is known. However, transforming truth through different refere nce frames and accounting for changes that occur during various radar processing algorithms is not as simple as it appears.  The techniques in this paper help expose this hidden complexity and provide a framework for discussing and expanding the future development of covariance consistency techniques.  Such future developments include issues related to mapping truth through the convolution operation typically used to simulate wideband signal processing and the fast Fourier transforms typically used in pulse-Doppler processing.  Sophisticated tracking algorithms that carry multiple hypotheses, associate across multiple frames, or weight the association of multiple targets within a single frame pose significant challenges in properly associating truth with state estimates.  Additional work, including an investigation of track-to-truth assignment, is needed before covariance consistency techniques can be applied to these algorithms Another area that needs furthe r analysis is the use of a sliding window to approximate the covariance behavior expected during a set of Monte-Carlo trials.  Various timedependent variables such as the target\222s range and orientation, the transmit waveform, the radar\222s antenna patterns toward the target, missed detections, and false alarms could easily viol ate the assumption that measurement conditions are nearly stationary over the time of the window.  It is importa nt to understand the conditions when this assumption is violated Finally, the examples presented here included a relatively benign arrangement of targets.  Further analysis in dense target environments with the related increase in merged detections, merged measurements, and impure tracks is needed.  Further analysis for targets traveling over different trajectories is also needed Even so, the techniques presented here can be extended to many of these analyses R EFERENCES  1  S. Blackman and R.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs. Essentially, Atom Service Casting may be viewed as a more human-friendly approach to UDDI R EFERENCES   NASA and Energy and W a t e r cy cl e St udy NEW S website: http://www.nasa-news.org  R odgers, C  D., and B  J.
