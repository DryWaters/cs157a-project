CDMA system is known to have some inherent advantages over other multiple accessing techniques in terrestrial wireless networks in providing various mobile communication services 1-5 Due to these advantages CDMA techniques are presently also applied to satellite systems providing wireless communication 6-7 In terrestrial systems highly linearized power amplifiers LPAs are used at the base station to avoid introduction of significant distortion into the transmitted CDMA signal This is feasible as the relatively low power efficiency of the LPAs is not very important in terrestrial systems However in the case of satellite downlinks the power 
efficiency of the high-power amplifiers HPAs is very important as the requirements on the power directly translate to the size weight and cost of the satellite payload Therefore in the case of satellite links the HPA by necessity needs to be operated in a region where significant distortion is introduced into the CDMA signal However to ensure that the communication link satisfies the required quality of service specified in terms of the probability of bit error or the probability of frame error etc it is necessary to keep the distortion caused by the HPA 
under specified limits In general higher output signal back-off in the HPA results in a lower distortion power however the attendant reduction in the HPA output signal power also reduces the signal-to-thermal noise ratio at the receiver input Thus it is highly desirable to optimize the HPA back-off to minimize the overall probability of bit error Pe resulting from the combined effect of both the HPA distortion and receiver thermal noise Such an optimization will in general depend upon the number of codes present in the CDMA signal the HPA characteristics and the downlink parameters such as 
channel characteristics and receive antenna gain determining the required transmit power for different users Thus it is of interest to determine the accurate signal-todistortion power ratio at the HPA output as a function of the output signal back-off the HPA characteristics and the number of CDMA codes and any other important parameters that must be included in the analysis In the literature the nonlinear distortion effects for the CDMA signal have been for the most part investigated using simulations 8-9 In 10 an analytic approach is described that models the CDMA signal as a nonzero mean 1 


Gaussian process and applies the extended Bussgang s theorem and related theoretical characterization for the OFDM signals developed in 11 The results are based on modeling one of the CDMA signals at the HPA input as deterministic which is then the mean of the input process while the power in the remaining code signals is treated as the variance of the Gaussian process Under such conditions it is shown that the HPA output may be expressed as the input signal multiplied by a time-varying gain plus an uncorrelated noise Such a result also requires that the power due to a single code is negligibly small compared to the total power In 10 the variance of the noise at the output is determined by taking the difference between the total output power and output signal powers and is thus based upon the signal term and the additional disturbance term Any deviation from this assumption can result in a significant error in the output SNR condition since the analysis of 10 does not provide any direct analytic expression for the power of the in-band noise component Moreover the analysis does not apply if the assumption of any single-user power being negligible compared to other users is not satisfied as is the case for very large values of M The analysis of 10 is limited to the case of equal power for all users In contrast to the previous analysis of the CDMA signal the analysis of this paper does not make the assumption of Gaussian distribution of the input CDMA signal This paper presents a direct method of analyzing the distortion effects of the power amplifier nonlinearity on the CDMA signal This approach is similar to that used in the analysis of the FDMA signals about which extensive literature exists see 12-14 and their references However there are also significant differences when such an approach is applied to the CDMA signals due to a unique property of the binaryvalued signals as detailed in this paper In the analysis approach of the paper the various user signals which are composed of data-modulated Walsh codes which are also modulated by various scrambling codes are modeled as independent random sequences These sequences are band limited using square-root raised cosine filters and modulated by a carrier frequency before being input to the nonlinear power amplifier In the paper the amplifier is modeled by a soft limiter characteristic described by an error function or any other specified function This paper derives a closed-form expression for the output signal power and the output signal power-to-distortion power spectral density ratio as a function of the input signal power back-off The expressions for both the output signal power and the output signal power-to-distortion power spectral density ratio are given in the form of infinite convergent series with its coefficients being functions of the amplifier input power level the number of codes and the amplifier transfer characteristics Alternatively the amplifier characteristics may be approximated by a polynomial of sufficiently high degree such that over the range of input signal the approximation error is negligible In an earlier paper by the author 15 for illustration of the methodology only the firstand third-degree terms are considered in the expansion These terms are enough if the amplifier is operated with sufficiently large output back-off However when the operation with relatively low back-off is considered higher-order terms are necessary to obtain accurate results This paper presents such a high-order analysis Although inclusion of many higher-order terms makes the analysis somewhat tedious the final result is in relatively simple form as is shown in the paper It may be noted that in the IM intermodulation noise analysis of the FDMA signal generally only third-order terms and at times fifth-order terms are considered adequate in the analysis 12-16 In the present application however due to the need for operating the amplifier at relatively low back-off terms on the order of forty are required to provide accurate results in that region of operation This paper also presents the output bit energy to distortion power spectral density ratio Eb Nod as a function of the input signal power back-off and as a function of the output signal power wherein the results are parameterized by the number of user signals M at the amplifier input The analysis of the paper shows that the output Eb/Nod is a strong function of M The results of the paper show that a minimum output signal back-off of about 4-5 dB is required where the output signal back-off is the output signal power relative to such power for a hard limiter with sine wave input The paper also shows that if the bit rate per user Rb is varied along with M with the total data bit rate RT at the amplifier input which is equal to M Rb held constant then the Eb/Nod does not have any significant variation with M for any output signal back-off Thus the paper shows that the amplifier possesses a maximum capacity defined as the maximum total bit rate RT that can be present at the amplifier input for a specified output signal power back-off and the required Eb/Nod ratio 2 SIGNAL MODEL AND ANALYSIS For the analysis in this paper the CDMA signal is composed of M data-modulated codes with the modulated signal filtered by a square root raised-cosine filter with roll-off factor r Because the data sequences modulating various codes are statistically independent the data-modulated signals may be modeled as statistically independent random binary sequences Thus the composite CDMA signal at the amplifier input may be modeled as Vi t  A cl t  c2 t    CM t COS\(OC t 1 where cj\(t for j  1 2 M represents the raised-cosine filtered version of the BPSK data-modulated code such that in the absence of band limiting filtering cj\(t takes values 1 or 1 Note that in the first part of the analysis it is assumed that the data modulation is BPSK however the method can be easily extended to the case of other modulation schemes including QPSK The amplifier is modeled by a memoryless nonlinearity which can be 2 


expressed in terms of its power series expansion Thus the amplifier output vo\(t may be expressed in terms of its input vi\(t by 3 2 To illustrate the analysis procedure consider first the cubic term in 2 and evaluate the signal and distortion terms contributed by this term Substitution of vi\(t from 1 in this term expanding the cos3\(cw,t in terms of cos\(cwt and cos\(3wot and retaining only the cos\(cwt term followed by the expansion of the cube of the summation of the code terms the fundamental zone term at the amplifier output contributed by the cubic term may be expressed as 3 3 M 3 M M2 V31 t  K3A l ECi t  3 E E ci t t j#i MM M  6 L L L cii\(t t t cos\(Cwct 3 i=lj=lk=1 j>ik>j Note that for the case of unfiltered signals c,\(t c2 t  1 i  1,2  I M 4a and therefore the first and second summations in 3 are actually signal components For the case of raised-cosine filtered signals 4b ch  t _ 1 i  1,2ag WM where   denotes time average With i t  c F t c t 5 then the distortion component in v31\(t may be expressed as 3 MM M v3Id t _-K3A 6 L L L ci t j t t cos\(Cw t 6 V1  i=l j=lk=l The number of terms in the three summations in 6 denoted by N1 N2 and N3 are equal to M M\(M-1 and M\(M-1 M-2 respectively In general M Nk k for any integer k  1 The table below enumerates N2 and N3 for several values of M of interest Table 1 Number of Distortion Terms M 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 N2 2 12 56 240 992 4032 16256 N3 0 4 56 560 4960 41664 341376 It is of interest to note that the number of distortion terms increases rapidly with M and that for M  8 N3 dominates N2 Thus for reasonably large values of M the distortion at the amplifier output may be approximated by V3Id Furthermore under the assumption that the various signals c,\(t are zero mean and statistically independent it follows that the various terms in the summation in 6 are uncorrelated To see this let q1\(t c1\(t t t and q2\(t c3\(t t t be two of the terms in 7 then the crosscorrelation function between q1\(t and q2\(t for any delay x is given by Rqlq2 t  q1 t t  t C t C2 t c3 t t  t c4 t  t c5 t  t 0 7 The property that the various distortion terms are uncorrelated has also been verified by simulations as shown in 15 Thus the cross-spectral density terms are zero and the power spectral density PSD of the sum is the sum of the PSDs of the individual distortion terms i.e 31d f 12\(9 2 K 2A 6 M\(M 1 M 2 P  27 K32A6 M\(M 1 M 2 f 16 3Aq f 8 where Pq\(f denotes the PSD of the individual terms c1\(t t t in the summation in 6 Similarly the terms of the type ci t t are the dominant signal terms present in v31\(t in 3 with the signal contribution due to v31\(t given by 3 M v3=s 3A 33\(M-1 Lci\(t wc t 9 4 i=1 The desired distortion power spectral density Nod is obtained by substituting f equal to zero in 8 when the contribution due to terms of order higher than 3 is disregarded This assumes that over the post code despreader bandwidth equal to the bit rate Rb the power spectral density Pq\(f is nearly constant 3 OUTPUT SIGNAL POWER TO DISTORTION TERM POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY RATIO For the case of unfiltered code signals the power spectral density of a third-order distortion term c,\(t cj\(t ck\(t is the 3 


same as the signal term c,\(t It has also been shown that even for the case of square-root raised cosine filtered case both the signal and distortion terms have the same power spectral densities These spectral densities have been obtained by simulations in 15 for the case of 1 Mcps code chip rate and are approximately equal to 58 dBW/Hz at f equal to zero For any other chip rate equal to Rem measured in Mcps the spectral density is simply normalized by R,m Thus the desired code signal power to distortion power spectral density ratio at the amplifier output is given by pS Pst Rcm N Od M Pd Pq O 0 where Pst is the total signal power obtained by summing the contributions due to terms of various degrees in the expansion in 2 similar to that obtained in 9 for the cubic nonlinearity term Pd is the total distortion power obtained by summing the contributions from terms of various orders similar to that obtained for the third-order terms in 8 except for the factor Pq\(f which is accounted for separately in 10 and R1m is the code chip rate in Mcps In 15 the result for Ps/Nod has been obtained by considering only the firstand third-degree terms in the expansion 2 applicable to the case when the amplifier operates under a relatively large output back-off In this paper the analysis is expanded to the case when an arbitrary number of terms in 2 may need to be considered as is the case when the amplifier is operated under a relatively small output back-off 4 SIGNAL POWER FROM HIGHER-ORDER ANALYSIS Following the analysis in 15 the amplifier output signal is given by r   3 1 M vos Ki41ttA  K343t3A  K545t5A5   i t cos\(cwc t i=l 1 1 where tm for j  1 3 is the coefficient of the cos\(coct term in the expansion of cosm\(coct into a sum of cosines for any odd integer m This corresponds to retaining only the terms at frequency co in the expansion of the terms vm for any integer m By definition 4 1 43 0.75 and the value of tm for any other odd integer m can be obtained by the following recursion cos m+2 0  cos m 0 cos 2\(0  a m,I Cos\(0  a m,3 cos\(30  a m m cos\(mO x 1  cos\(20 2  a m+2,1 cos\(0  a m+2,3 cos\(30   a m+2,m+2 cos\(\(m  2 12 Thus by using simple trigonometric identities for the product of two cosine terms the coefficients am 2j can be obtained in terms of am,j for any odd integer m by 14 below am+21  0.75aml  0.25am,3 am+2j 5am,j+0.25ammj-2 1<j<m j:odd am+2,m+2  0.25 am,m 13 The tm values thus computed by MATLAB for some of the values of m are listed in the table below Table 2 Coefficients em m 1 3 5 7 9 11 tm 1 0.75 0.625 0.547 0.492 0.451 In 11 the tm term for m  1 3  denotes the summation of the number of terms of various types generating the signal terms weighted by the corresponding coefficient of the term in the expansion of the mth power of the input baseband signal For example t1  1 and t3  3\(M-1 as in 9 To evaluate t5 one may observe that in the expansion of c1 c2  CM for example the signal terms are of the type ci4cj and ci2cj2ck with i  j  k The total number of terms of the type c 4cj is equal to M\(M-1 while the number of the terms of the type ci2cj2ck is equal to M\(M-1 M-2 Thus for relatively large values of M the terms of the type ci2ci2ck dominate In terms of their coefficients in the expansion the coefficient of the ci4cj type term is equal to  5 compared to the coefficient of the c 2cj2ck type term equal to 2 30 Thus both the number and coefficient of Ci2Cj2ck type terms dominate and thus t5 which is the contribution per output code signal term is equal to 14 t 5 5 M 1 M 2 2 22 Similarly in the expansion of c1 c2  cM with N 2 2 2 2k+1 the terms of the type c I c.2  c1k c k  with all indices i1 i2  ik+1 distinct are dominant The total number of such terms is equal to M\(M-1 M-k with their coefficient equal to N  Thus tN which is equal to the number of terms per code signal weighted by the their coefficients is given by N M 1 M 2 M-k  N M-1 tN  k I 2 kk 2kyk 15 4 


Substitution for tN from 15 into 11 yields the following expression for any one of the code signals at the amplifier output v-os A E Pst R cm Nod MPd Pq\(O 21 where Rem is the code chip rate in Mcps As an illustration the above analysis is applied to obtain numerical results for an amplifier with some specified inputoutput characteristics The amplifier characteristic selected for the illustration is a soft limiter model detailed below Note however that the analysis of the paper is applicable to any other input-output characteristics that are encountered in practice 6 POWER AMPLIFIER CHARACTERISTICS It is assumed that the amplifier is compensated for the AMPM conversion which will otherwise result in a phase noise in the code signals cq\(t which can be separately studied In practice this is generally the case There may also be a linearization of the AM-AM characteristics however the linearization is achievable only over a finite input power limit due to the obvious output power constraint Beyond this limit the amplifier is again saturated Thus the linearized amplifier may be modeled by limiter amplifier characteristics which can be analyzed by the approach of this paper Thus in the first instance only the AM-AM distortion is studied Two different amplifier models are considered for the analysis In the first model the amplifier is approximated by a soft limiter model with its input-output characteristic described by the following nonlinear function F\(u given by F\(u  erf\(u  2 2 U f exp\(-4  2 21 0 22 5 n X 2 K 1 J n 1  2 x n odd M E ci t cos\(ic t i=l 16 With Pi MA2/2 denoting the amplifier input power and substituting n  2j+1 the signal term may be rewritten as wh=A K2j 1 3ci\(t ot 17a where rlo  1 II i  1 1 1J  O  j  M 17b and where jm+l denotes the number of significant terms in the summation Thus the total signal power Pst at the amplifier output may be approximated as PStPI rE K2j+12j+1 2;j  Pi 18 5 POWER IN HIGHER-ORDER DISTORTION TERMS Considering the expansion of c1 C2+...+cm among the various distortion terms that are present are the terms of the type c.2cjckcl and cicjckclcm with all the indices i j k 1 and m distinct The number of terms of the first type is equal to M\(M-1 M-2 M-3 whereas the number of terms of the second type is equal to M\(M-1 M-2 M-3 M-4 Thus for relatively large M the number of the second type is dominant A similar result is also known to apply to the FDMA signal analysis The coefficients of these two types of terms are equal to 5!/2 and 5 respectively Thus the contribution due to the terms of the type cicjckclcm is dominant Ignoring other distortion terms will thus provide a tight lower bound to the total distortion power at the amplifier output In the same manner the number of dominant terms in the expansion of c1 c2 c+M is equal to tn   with the coefficient of each such term n equal to n for any odd integer n Thus the total distortion power at the amplifier output may be approximated as  2E 2 1M n A 19 2 n=3 nodd Substituting P1 MA2 2 and n  2k-1 the expression for Pd may be written in the following equivalent form 1 22k1 Pd  E K2kI 12k-1[\(2k-l 2k-2 2Pi 20 2k where q for any integer j is defined above in 1 8b Approximating the PSD of each of the distortion terms at zero frequency by Pq\(O the Ps/Nod is given by 10 which is reproduced by Ps

A filter lag or so-called cluster tracking can easily result in a 5% or greater offset and degraded consistency.  After 300 seconds the curves peak up because the target is appr oaching a low-elevation beampoint limit.  This occurs anytime a target is tracked into the edge of the radar\222s field of re gard and can lead to radar-toradar handover difficulty         300 300 80  s D 2 k,1 k y    s D 2 k,1 k y   100 150 200 250 10 1                    10 5 1 0  Figure 8 - Consistency versus distance from beam center Monopulse Mismatch The next set of curves plotted in Figure 9 show the sensitivity of detection-primitive consistency to a mismatch in the monopulse slope.  All of these curves were generated using a linear monopulse response derived from the slope of the true monopulse response at beam center.  The slope of the 80% curve is 0.8 times th e beam-center slope; the 90 curve is 0.9 times the beam-center slope; and so on for 100%, 110% and 120%.  Again, the order of curves in the graph is the same as the legend order A steep slope tends to expand y I 222s uncertainty while a gentle slope tends to compress it.  An expanded uncertainty leads to a smaller consistency while a compressed uncertainty leads to a larger consistency.  This behavior can be observed in the family of curves in Figure 9.  Curves for the steeper slopes are on the botto m while curves for more gentle slopes are on top.  The notable feature of this set of curves is that the sensitivity to a mismatch in the monopulse slope is not very significant       100 150 200 250 10 1                    90 100 110 120  Figure 9 - Consistency versus monopulse mismatch Range-Bias Error The complex nature of the monopulse radar models presents ample opportunity to introduce errors in the software implementation.  One such e rror introduced in a \275 rangecell-width bias in the detection-primitive range which in turn resulted in a significant degradation to 2 9 k D The fact that 2 9 k D is measured in different coordinates compared to the bias made it difficult to determine which value or algorithm was to blame.  Examining the intermediate consistency values led directly to the error source A comparison between biased 2 1 k D  2 2 k D and 2 3 k D values and unbiased 2 2 k D values is shown in Figure 10.  The unbiased 2 2 k D is the bottom-most curve and the biased 2 3 k D is the top-most curve with a value around 80.  This large value for 2 3 k D indicates that there is a lot more uncertainty in the range measur ements compared to what is predicted by the range varian ce.  Since the range-variance calculation is easy to confirm, the problem must be in the algorithms that model or manipulate range A notable feature of Figure 10 is the sensitivity of the centroiding algorithm to range bias in the detection primitives.  The range bias is ba rely noticeable in the biased 2 1 k D and 2 2 k D curves.  Of course, if the unbiased 2 2 k D  curve existed as a baseline it would be relatively easy to spot the error

As previously promised, the effects and corrections for atmospheric refr action and sensor bias have been disabled so that 2 8 k D can be analyzed using a sliding window.  Of course the full analysis would include these effects and 2 8 k D at each time step would be collected and averaged over many trials Plots of the effect of changing process noise in a nearlyconstant-velocity filter are shown in Figure 12 and Figure 13 for Cartesian position and velocity respectively.  In both figures, the plotted values have been divided by 3 so that the desired value is always 1.  Increasing the process noise up to a point should increase the updated uncertainty and reduce 2 8 k D values.  Except near th e end of the trajectory when the measurements are off of beam center, the curves in Figure 12 and Figure 13 appear inconclusive for this expected trend If 2 8 k D values are way out of range there are additional intermediate filter values that can be examined.

Analyzing covariance consistency is applicable to radar systems both in the field and in simulations.  The primary challenge in both arenas comes down to properly accounting for the true target states that contribute to detections, detection primitives measurements, and state estimates For a fielded radar syst em, achieving covariance consistency is usually a s econdary consideration behind achieving and maintaining track s.  Indeed, until recently radar specifications did not even include requirements for covariance consistency.  Recent covariance consistency requirements stem from the fact that the use of radar systems in sensor netting applications is on the rise Currently the combined e ffects of off-beam-center measurements, atmospheric correction, bias correction clustering and centrioding, data association, and filtering on state covariance consistency throughout a target\222s trajectory are not well known.  This is particularly true for radars using wideband waveforms and multiple hypotheses or multiple frame trackers.  Numerical results presented here indicate that algorithms early in the radar signal processing chain can significantly degrad e covariance consistency and that some errors are better tolerated than others For a simulated target in a modeled system, truth relative to some global reference is known. However, transforming truth through different refere nce frames and accounting for changes that occur during various radar processing algorithms is not as simple as it appears.  The techniques in this paper help expose this hidden complexity and provide a framework for discussing and expanding the future development of covariance consistency techniques.  Such future developments include issues related to mapping truth through the convolution operation typically used to simulate wideband signal processing and the fast Fourier transforms typically used in pulse-Doppler processing.  Sophisticated tracking algorithms that carry multiple hypotheses, associate across multiple frames, or weight the association of multiple targets within a single frame pose significant challenges in properly associating truth with state estimates.  Additional work, including an investigation of track-to-truth assignment, is needed before covariance consistency techniques can be applied to these algorithms Another area that needs furthe r analysis is the use of a sliding window to approximate the covariance behavior expected during a set of Monte-Carlo trials.  Various timedependent variables such as the target\222s range and orientation, the transmit waveform, the radar\222s antenna patterns toward the target, missed detections, and false alarms could easily viol ate the assumption that measurement conditions are nearly stationary over the time of the window.  It is importa nt to understand the conditions when this assumption is violated Finally, the examples presented here included a relatively benign arrangement of targets.  Further analysis in dense target environments with the related increase in merged detections, merged measurements, and impure tracks is needed.  Further analysis for targets traveling over different trajectories is also needed Even so, the techniques presented here can be extended to many of these analyses R EFERENCES  1  S. Blackman and R.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs. Essentially, Atom Service Casting may be viewed as a more human-friendly approach to UDDI R EFERENCES   NASA and Energy and W a t e r cy cl e St udy NEW S website: http://www.nasa-news.org  R odgers, C  D., and B  J.
