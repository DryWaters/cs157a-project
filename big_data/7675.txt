NOPIAH, M.N.BAHARIN Department of Mechanical and Materials Engineering Engineering Faculty Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia 43600 UKM Bangi, Selangor, MALAYSIA shahrum@vlsi.eng.ukm.my   Abstract Automotive suspension systems have big potential of mechanical failure due to fatigue as this system was subjected to the variable amplitude loading under service condition. This study was specifically focuses on coil spring one of the suspension system parts. When vehicle was driven on any road surfaces and hit potholes or bump, this coil spring is then affected by the significant load. This significant load will cause the damage to this component. The objective of this study to predict the coil spring fatigue damage and then relate it with the I-kaz coefficient, results from a new statistical-based method, I-kaz method. The signal captured from this repeated loading was known as fatigue signal. The car was driven on three different roads, highway, country road and damagesurface road. The strain gauges were mounted on the outer surfaces of the coil spring to capture the fatigue load variable amplitude data on the road. The recorded strain was then analysed for fatigue damage and I-kaz coefficient purposes From the analysis, it was found that the damage road gives the highest fatigue damage rather than the other road and also the fatigue damage was proportionally related to the I-kaz coefficient Keywords- Fatigue damage, kurtosis-based coefficient, coil spring, variable amplitude loading I   I NTRODUCTION  Automotives industry increasingly seeks to achieve higher quality level for their vehicles. The vehicle components such as parts of engine, suspension and body structures has come to be required to be able to withstand increasingly higher stresses [1  T h is stu d y  w a s fo c u se s on the coil spring, one part of the suspension system as this system was directly experiencing the load when the vehicle driven over the road Generally, coil springs are desired to be resistant to high load, in particular, resistant to fatigue. Failure of a coil spring due to fatigue typically occurs through the crack initiation and propagation of cracks when subjected to the cyclic loading. Since fatigue is one of the major causes in vehicle component failure, its life prediction or fatigue damage has become a subject of discussion in many texts. So, it is really worthy if the detail causes of fatigue damage of the coil spring which is specific focuses on the types of road surfaces is studied. Different road surfaces give different amounts of the load to this component under service conditions. The significant amount of this load will give the significant strain to the coil spring.  From this displacement, fatigue life assessment will come out in this study to predict the fatigue damage of the coil spring. The strain-life 0010 N is used for the analysis as the case study was related to the low cycle fatigue, which is a suitable approach to analyse random data collected from automotive components Another analysis to be performed for the purpose of this paper is the statistical analysis, which is a new statisticalbased method, called Integrated Kurtosis-based Algorithm for Z-filter Technique, I-kaz. The I-kaz method calculates the related coefficient for the measured fatigue signal.  The input data of the I-kaz method was fatigue signal that was obtained from the road test. The damage for the signal was monitored by the value of the I-kaz coefficient 037 001\036 and three dimensional graphic display of the magnitude distribution 2   This work was assessing the fatigue damage of the coil spring when subjected to the variable amplitude loading and also the value of the kurtosis-based coefficient using the same fatigue signal. The goal is to determine   the correlation between fatigue damage and I-kaz coefficient of the coil spring. Thus, from the obtained results, the method of assessment of the fatigue damage can be done or not using the kurtosis-based method. Material fatigue properties were obtained from the Glyphworks® software. First the experimental procedure is described. Next the failure analysis, captured fatigue signal as the input to predict the fatigue damage for each of the road and the type of the road which will causes the most damages to this component. Then a statistical analysis as to obtain the kurtosis-based coefficient of the fatigue road signal.    Finally the comparative study is performed in order to determine the correlation of these two parameters and was discussed II  L ITERATURE B ACKGROUND  A  Fatigue Life Assesment Fatigue is a localised damage process of a component produced by cyclic loading. It is the cumulative process consisting of crack initiation, propagation and final fracture of component. During cyclic loading, localised plastic deformation may occur at the highest stress site. This plastic deformation induces permanent damage to the component and a crack develops. As the component experiences an increasing number of loading cycles, the length of the crack damage\lso increases. After a certain number of cycles the crack will cause the component to fail

This suspension system component was important and feasible to predict crack initiation in order to avoid fatigue failure by removing the part from service at the appropriate time rather than analysed for fatigue life using crack growth approaches [3 It is n o t s u it ab l e t o a p ply th e c r a c k in s p ect ion  process for inexpensive components that are made in large numbers as performing this periodic inspections on these components would generally increase the cost of the item 4   The foundation of the strain-life approach is the CoffinManson relationship and it is defined as the following equation   c f N f b f N E f a  2   2  002 003 002   1 In the real data application of the fatigue service loading mean stress can have a substantial effect on the metallic fatigue behaviour. In this strain-life approach, two meanstress effect models are commonly being used, i.e. the Morrow and the Smith-Watson-Topper \(SWT\rain-life models. The Morrow’s strain-life model [5 is mathematically defined by  c f N f b f N f m E f a  2    2   1  002 003 003 003 002  000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000   2 The SWT strain-life model [6 m a th em atically  expressed by  c b f f f b f f a N N E     2     2     2 max 002 003 003 002 003 3 For all those three strain-life expressions E is the material modulus elasticity 0011 max is the true maximum stress 0011 m is the mean stress 0010 a is the true strain amplitude 2N f is the number of reversals to failure 0011 f  is the fatigue strength coefficient b is the fatigue strength exponent 0010 f  is the fatigue ductility coefficient and c is the fatigue ductility exponent. The Morrow’s strain-life model is significant at lower values of plastic strain and has little effect at higher plastic strains. For loading sequences that are predominantly in tensile, the SWT approach was recommended to be used for fatigue life estimation. In the case where the loading is predominantly compressive the Morrow approach can be used to provide more accurate life estimates [7   The fatigue damage caused by each cycle is calculated by reference to material life curves, i.e. stress life S-N strain life 0010 N curves. The N f value for each cycle can be obtained from Equation \(1\o \(3\or all three models, and the fatigue damage value D for one cycle is calculated as  000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000  f N D 1 4 The total damage caused by N cycles is referred to the Palmgren-Miner rule, for which the accumulated damage 002\010 D is expressed as 004 000  000 f i N N 5 Where N i  is the number of cycles within a particular stress range and mean, and N f is the number of cycles to failure for a particular stress range and mean. A fatigue cycle is defined as a closed loop on a cyclic stress-strain curve The fatigue damage is mainly related to cyclic amplitude, or ranges, and not to peak values B  Signal Analysis Behaviour A signal is a series of numbers that come from measurement, typically obtained using some recording method as a function of time . In the case of fatigue analysis the signal consists of a measurement of the cyclic loads, i.e force, strain and stress against time and measured signal is commonly consist of variation of amplitude, frequency phase and energy. The objective of time series analysis is to determine the statistical characteristics of the original function by manipulating the series of discrete numbers [8 In actual applications, mechanical signals can be classified to have a stationary or non-stationary behaviour. For nonstationary that is common for the fatigue analysis cases however, the statistical parameter values of a signal are dependent to the time of measurement. In the case of nonstationary signals the global signal statistical values are dependent on the time of measurement [9   The global signal statistics are frequently used to classify random signals and the most commonly used statistical parameters are the mean value, the standard deviation value the root-mean-square \(r.m.s.\ value, the skewness and the kurtosis. Different types of the road will give the different statistical analysis results because fatigue signal patterns vary for each road. In this work, statistic analysis has been done using the I-kaz method, a new statistical-based method Based on kurtosis, I-kaz method provides a three dimensional graphical representation of the measured signal frequency distribution. The time domain signal has decomposed into three frequency bands,  which are x-axis which is for low frequency \(LF\ range of 10-20 kHz, y-axis which is for high frequency \(HF\ range of 20-50 kHz and zaxis, which is for very high frequency \(VF\ range of 50-100 kHz. In order to measure the scatter of data distribution, the I-kaz coefficient calculates the distance of each data point from signal centroid [11  Ik a z c o ef f i cien t is d e f i n e d as   037 000  v V H H L L s K s K s K n 4 4 4 1   6 Where n is the number of data, K L K H K V are the kurtosis of signal in LF, HF and VF range and sL, sH and sV are the standard deviation of signal in LF, HF and VF range respectively. The standard deviation 001 n data point is mathematically defined as

Higher kurtosis values indicate the presence of more extreme values than should be found in a Gaussian distribution. Kurtosis is used in engineering for detection of fault symptoms because of its sensitivity to high amplitude events [19  III  M ETHODOLOGIES  The input signal that was used in this study was a variable amplitude \(VA\ strain loading, and it was sampled at 500 Hz for the 60 seconds record length. Thus, the time series of 30,000 data points was then produced. The arrangement of the actual data acquisition apparatus that was used in this data collection is shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2 shows the block diagram of the experimental process briefly The strain loading was measured using strain gauges of 2 mm size and this is shown in Figure 3. This figure presented the strain gauge position at the coil spring when the fatigue signal was measured. The fatigue data acquisition system SoMat eDAQ Data Acquisition, was used for the fatigue strain data measurement as shown in Figure 1. The signal was measured on the front right coil spring of a car travelling over a highway and country road at the same velocity 70km/h, and damage-surface road at 40km/h. The uneven surface condition of the damage-surface road makes the car to drive slowly. The velocity differences of the car will not actually give the high effect since this work was focuses on the correlation between fatigue damage and kurtosis-based coefficient  Figure 1  Arrangement of fatigue data acquisition system for data measuring experiment The selected material for the simulation testing purpose was the chromium steel, SAE5160. This material was chosen because it was commonly used to fabricate a coil spring for the vehicle suspension system. The material properties and their definitions are given in Table 1            Figure 2  The block diagram of the fatigue road test After finishing the road test, the signal was then analysed for the fatigue damage and kurtosis-based coefficient purposes. The GlyphWorks® software was used to calculate the fatigue damage of the coil spring and MATLAB® software was used to run this analysis as to obtain the I-kaz coefficient and three dimensional graphical representations of the captured fatigue signal which is obtained from the road test  Figure 3  The strain gauge position when measuring the fatigue signal TABLE I  M ECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF THE C HROMIUM STEEL   SAE5160 Properties Chromium steel, SAE 5160 Ultimate tensile strength S u MPa 1584 Modulus of elasticity E GPa 207 Fatigue strength coefficient 0011  f  MPa\ 2063 Fatigue strength exponent b 0.08 Fatigue ductility exponent c 1.05 Fatigue ductility coefficient  0010  f 9.56  IV  R ESULTS AND D ISCUSSION  A  Time Domain Signal The captured strain loading data was analysed in the time domain signal plots. The original time domain signal for each types of the road were obtained, and their time histories are presented in Figure 4. It was show that the total strain amplitude or strain range for the highway, country road and damage-surface road were 541 microstrain, 590 microstrain and 981 microstrain, respectively The potholes and bumps along the road contributing to the spikiness of the fatigue data. This is can be seen at every signal, for example, the spikiness was observed at 15th Strain g au g e Data acquisition Data display Strain gauge Suspension system \(Coil spring

seconds for highway. At the same time, the spikiness phenomenon also occurs at the high amplitude compared to the other signal amplitude. From Figure 4 it can be seen that obviously damage-surface road experiencing the most spikiness from 32th to 52th seconds. This is because of the high amplitude loading transferred to the coil spring when the car travelling over that road   a  b  c Figure 4  The strain signal of each type of the road \(a\ highway, \(b country road, \(c\damage-surface road B  Fatigue Damage Analysis Table 2 shows the results for the fatigue damage after analysing using GlyphWorks®. This analysis was based on Coffin-Manson, Morrow and Smith-Watson-Topper \(SWT approaches. As for fatigue damage for the each approaches damage-surface road give the highest fatigue damage and then followed by country road. The highway gives the lowest fatigue damage for the Coffin-Manson \(CM\, Morrow and SWT approach. The values of the fatigue damage can be referred in Table 2 The damage road experiencing the shortest fatigue life although the velocity of the car was the lowest among the velocity on the other roads, because of the road surfaces that is physically not in well condition such as pothole and not uniform. They are too small distances between one pothole to another and also the uneven depth of the pothole. This gives the high strain when the car passes by the damagesurface road although the velocity of the car is 40km/h. So this result were matching with the time domain signal that shown in the Figure 4, that shows the damage-surface road gives the highest strain amplitude range rather than the other road Country road which is driven at 70km/h gives the lower fatigue damage rather than highway which is also driven at the same velocity.  Along country road, there are many bumps and potholes. These factors gave the significant load to the coil spring   when the car crosses over it. As for highway, the smooth surfaces make the coil spring did not experience much displacement compared to the damage and country road and this is related to the fatigue damage which is shown in Table 2, highway gives the lowest value for each,  CM, Morrow and SW T approaches, 0.00027 x 10 3  0.00045 x 10 3 and 0.00066 x 10 3 respectively TABLE II  F ATIGUE DAMAGE FOR EACH ROAD BASED ON THE CM  M ORROW AND SWT APPROACH  Types of Road Fatigue Damage \(x 10 3  CM Morrow SWT Highway\(70km/h 0.00027 0.00045 0.00066 Country \(70km/h 0.00076 0.00193 0.0034 Damage-surface\(40km/h 0.126 0.183 0.216  C  I-kaz Coefficient 037 001\036   The I-kaz coefficient 037 001\036 as shown in the Eq. \(6\as generated which measures the space of scattering of the I-kaz display. After doing the analysis using MATLAB®, the Ikaz Coefficient 037 001\036  for each of the road were obtained and the results were shown in Figure 5 From Figure 5, damage-surface road gives the highest 037 001\036  value that is 0.5413, then followed by country road, 0.3291 and the lowest 037 001\036  value is highway, 0.2179. In addition, it viewed clearly in the I-kaz display that the space of scattering of the frequency distribution was relatively going bigger when the 037 001\036 value is bigger. It means that, the higher frequency present in the fatigue signal, the higher 037 001\036 value This is the reason for the biggest space of scattering for the damage-road surface. In order to do a comparative study, this 037 001\036 values show obviously that the higher value of 037 001\036  give the higher value of the fatigue damage as shown in Table 3 This correlation was illustrated in Figure 6. From I-kaz coefficient versus log fatigue damage versus graph, it shows the proportional correlation between fatigue damage and Ikaz coefficient. The I-kaz coefficient was relatively higher when the fatigue damage is higher. This is actual for every approaches, CM, Morrow and SWT.Kurtosis and standard deviation value for highway, country road and damage road can be seen in Table 4. This is the statistical results obtained using Glyphworks software.  Refers to Table 4, kurtosis value for Country road was higher than damage road value This is happen because refers to Figure 4, country road was gave more spikiness or transient rather than damage road although the strain amplitude was lower compare to damage road. This is because kurtosis is highly sensitive to the spikiness of the data

The data collected from the coil spring of an automobile which was driven over highway, country road and damage road surface were used as the subject of this study. This comparative study shows that fatigue damage was proportionally related to the I-kaz coefficient. The reason behind this statement is fatigue damage has relationship with kurtosis and I-kaz coefficient was obviously based on kurtosis and standard deviation. This result shows that, fatigue damage determination can be evaluated either using strain-life approach or I-kaz method A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The authors would like to express their gratitude to Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia and Ministry of Science Technology and Innovation, through the fund of UKM-GUPBTT-07-25-158, for supporting these research activities  R EFERENCES   1  A.

Yparity bit 1  D2  D\261 4 Feedback branch 1 D D 5 However in more precise description there are some discrepancies in each of Turbo Coding implementations The comparison between two schemes is realized in Table 4 As it is shown in the table below the main difference between coding schemes is that double bit sequence is present at input of encoder in OFDM process chain In addition inside the RSC the second bit should allow for future bit sequence transformation Table 4 Turbo Code Comparison for WCDMA and OFDM implementations Characteristics Type Termination Polynomials Rates WCDMA OFDM Binary 8-state Duo-Binary 8-state Tail bits 13 15 17 1/41 12  3 Circular 13 15 up to 8 4.1.2 Interleaver The interleaving process allows to avoid the burst error during signal transmission In both cases two permutations are performed From the UMTS point of view there is first interleaving made on a TrCH bit sequence The intercolumns permutation is done by the matrix with determined number of columns The number of columns depends on the size of TTI see Table 5 The main parameter of permutation scheme choice is TTI which is defined as a set of serially concatenated transport blocks and indicates how often data from the higher layer comes to the physical layer According to particular permutation pattern the output of I't interleaving is read as bit sequence Table 5 Link between TTI and number of columns TTI ms 10 20 40 80 Number of columns 1 2 4 8 Permutation patterns 0 0,1 0 2 1,3 0 4 2 6 1 5 3 7 Next important process is intra-frame interleaving The second interleaving is performed in the physical channel This intra-frame permutation limits the number of columns to 30 and uses the universal common pattern to minimize the processing load and thus to reduce hardware scale and power consumption Also here a matrix has a rectangular structure and it is constituted by padding the dummy bits which are then pruned away in the output of the matrix after the inter-column permutation In OFDM we work with frequency interleaving mechanism which is aimed to spread the burst errors out in the bit-stream after FEC This process is accomplished in two step permutation first sub-carrier permutation and second bit-to-symbol mapping permutation Thus the mapping is performed by constellation of adjacent code bits into nonadjacent subcarriers Then these code bits are mapped onto significant components The block size equals to 384 coded bits per one interleaved block This number was defined by the functional dependence interleaver block size and modulation type given that in our framework model we use the QPSK modulation and the default number of subchannels i.e 16 The number of code bits NCPC equals to 2 in each sub-carrier Thus 1 12 6 where mk is coded bit index after first and before second permutation Nh'p is number of coded bits per allocated subchannels per OFDM symbol for our model assume 384 k is code bit index in input and equals to 0 1  Ncbps1 Second permutation allows constructing the bit-to-symbol mapping by equation jk mk  mk  N floor\(12.mk  N,bp  l 7 The issue is creation of common interleaving block The way of transformation will depend on kind of characteristic bit sequences These bit sequences should have the size corresponding to OFDM or WCDMA model 4.1.3 Data mapping In this subsection we describe the data mapping of the bit sequence onto I and Q branches using QPSK constellation In our UMTS/WiMAX system we consider QPSK as mapping scheme allocated before spreading transformation of WCDMA signal and before FFT mechanism for the OFDM signal It is necessary to say that QPSK mapping is a transfer of bit sequence consisting of binary 0 and binary 1 into the inphase 1 and the quadrature 1 of the realvalued part respectively Below we define the similarities and differences between the QPSK mapping of WCDMA signal and OFDM bit sequence in respect to SDR realization Since our model is developed for both dedicated transport and physical channels in followings explanations we speaks only about these types of channels in UMTS chain Data Mapping is accomplished after mapping Code Composite Transport Channel CCTrCH 19 constituted by multiplexing of few Transport Channels TrCH onto Dedicated Physical Channel as depicted on Figure 9 One PhCH can include just one CCTrCH in other words one CCTrCH can be spread between different PhCHs but there is no different CCTrCHs in one PhCH 8 we have fixed permutation pattern defined by equation mk  Ncbp 12 k.odl2 floor\(k

an attribute specified for each transport channel TrCH and depending one limitation This limitation is that only one symbol In the special blocks description we also focused our attention parameters case where ensure the suitable end frame size which corresponds to the specified bit rate and the spreading factor After this Rate Matching RM is applied This process plays the key role in further procedures The matching ensure the right way for physical channels mapping and data processing After multiplexing all TrCHs into can be mapped onto we choose the size of transport block equal to 1280 bits Hence this step we can be eliminated from the system Next step in signal processing is presented by Frame segmentation element Figure 11 Example of pseudo code for radio frame segmentation module Frame segmentation should be done to we can avoid the presence of this procedure PhCH mapping process includes few items Data mapping Channelization and Scrambling As shown in the Figure 1 on SDR blocks work The step-by-step data exchange between one or more Coded Composite Transport Channels CCTrCH one or several PhCHs If one PhCH is used common and special blocks is presented in Figure 12 vi r fIJMT 4ooo o Figure 12 Data processing block scheme 10 READ module rfsegmentation DETERMINE number of frames SET input signal to particular input port IF number of frame more than 1 THEN EXTRACT first data bits of input bits sequence SET framel equals to input data bits PRINT length of framel EXTRACT next data bits of input bits sequence SET frame2 equals to next part PRINT length of frame2 EXTRACT last data bits of input data bits SET frameN equals to last data bits PRINT length of frameN SET output sequence equals to framel frame2 frameN ENDIF SET output port equals to output on two different modules for both chains spreading module for UMTS and IFFT256 for WiMAX Spread spectrum mechanism is the most important thing in whole signal processing chain of WCDMA PHY It is based on the Direct Sequence which provides the expending of one PhCH hence are calculated As ensures equality of the total bit rate after transport channel TrCH multiplexing to the total channel bit rate of the allocated dedicated physical channels PhCH The main parameter of the rate matching is on the upper layers During this step the determination of the spreading factor and the number of physical channels needed for the given number of TrCH we can map CCTrCH into Physical Channel but there is one CCTrCH we have we have to apply PhCH segmentation block In our system implementation we consider a QPSK mapping is used for Data Mapping in Physical channel mapping processing This scheme maps every two bits into signal END 1 E a result of fulfilling this step the correct form of TrCH multiplexing is selected that a bandwidth by unique channelization code This code should be generated by code-tree of orthogonal variable spreading factor OVSF codes Thus it guarantees the orthogonality between different channels during signal transmission 1 In OFDM chain the main role is played by IFFT256 that converts time domain presentation into frequency domain and provides orthogonal independency between adjacent subcarriers 4.3 Main Procedures between SDR blocks There are a set of inherent procedures in the system work which must be done during the signal transmission between SDR blocks 1 Verification the signal nature 2 Switching to particular signal path 3 Reconfiguration of the system according to required protocol scheme 4 Stepby-step signal processing 5 Signal transmission in the chosen mode These procedures present only basic process The BB processing which this paper is presented based more than
