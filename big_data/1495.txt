Study of BGA Package Cap for High-performance \nComputing GPU \nWenjie Mao, Yaping Zhou, Aniket Naik, Sunil Sudhakaran \nNVIDIA Corporation \nwmao@nvidia.com,yapingz@nvidia.com,anaik@nvidia.com,ssudhakaran@nvidia.com  \n nAbstract - GPU for high performance computing shows high \ncurrent consumption and fast current variation which presents a \nbig design challenge for power delivery. In this paper, power \ndelivery design for a computing GPU is discussed focusing on \npackage capacitors. Current behaviour of a computing \napplication is illustrated first. The related power delivery \nchallenge is presented with simulation and measurement. Next npackage capacitors are proposed to reduce noise and studied via \nsimulation according to their placement value, number, and \ntype. Simulation data shows land side cap placed between IO \nrails and core VDD balls can effectively reduce power delivery \nnoise without compromising BGA density. Measurement data \ncorrelates well with simulated power noise. There is about a \n55mv noise improvement which yields a gain of 150MHz in GPU noperational frequency. \nI. INTRODUCTION \nAs the demand for high performance parallel computing \nincreases across many areas of science, medicine, engineering, \nand finance, GPU corporations continue to innovate and meet \nthat demand with extraordinarily powerful GPU computing \narchitectures. Kepler GK110 GPU raises the parallel \ncomputing bar considerably and will help solve the world’s \nmost difficult computing problems [1]. \n nFig. 1.  GK110 Die Image \nKepler GK110 is built first and foremost for Tesla, and its \ngoal is to be the highest performing parallel computing \nmicroprocessor in the world. A full Kepler GK110 \nimplementation includes 15 Streaming Multiprocessor \(SMX  nastonishing 7.1 billion transistors on a 28nm process which is \nthe most complex IC commercially available on planet [3]. \nThis creates 3.95 Tflops peak double precision floating point \nperformance as well as more than 100A current consumption. \nThis high current causes a big challenge to have a good power \ndelivery from power supply to die. Failure to do so can result \nin excessive noise that can impact performance by limiting the nmaximum operable frequency [4][5]. \n Since the current drawn by the GPU can change suddenly, \nan impedance target for the power supply network needs to be \nmet across a wide range of frequency. This is typically naccomplished by using a multi-stage decoupling with different \ntypes of capacitors. There are lots of papers discussed power \ndelivery design for high performance microprocessor [6][7][8]. \nThere are, however, few papers related to the power delivery \nof high-performance computing GPU. \nIn this paper, current behaviour of computing GPU is \ndiscussed first by comparing with the usual graphic \napplication of the GPU. A different decoupling solution is \nintroduced as well. A simulation study and measurement \ncorrelation is presented in the section III to illustrate the \nchallenge. Section IV focuses on the decoupling solution \ninvolving the BGA package. Cap value, type, number are \nstudied by simulation to achieve an optimized power delivery nperformance subject to cost. Section V shows measurement \ndata is aligned well with simulation prediction About \n150MHz GPU operation frequency is gained due to noise \nreduction. \nII. CURRENT & DECOUPLING BEHAVIOUR nAn innovative power estimation flow is used to estimate the \ndynamic current consumption of the entire GPU This \nmethodology is able to provide a one clock period accurate \ncurrent profile for each specific partition with a long time slot. \nBased on this method, current behaviour of each GPU with \ndifferent kinds of applications can be understood quite well. \n \n Fig. 2.  Current Segment for Graphic Applications \nFigure 2 shows a worst current segment from low to high \nswitching when the GPU is running a traditional stressful ngraphic application. It shows the worst current slew rate is \n70 Clock Periods \n978-1-4799-0409-9/13/$31.00 2013 IEEE 858\naround 70ns which is much slower than microprocessor \ncurrent slew rate. This leads to some power delivery design \ndifferences between GPU and CPU [9]. One key difference is \nthat GPU package doesn’t need to have any package caps due \nto the slow slew di/dt change. The noise can be filtered by the \nboard caps close to chip. In this way, the cost of GPU card can \nbe reduced.  \nHigh performance CPU’s always use PGA \(Pin Grid Array between package and \nboard which requires more capacitors to cancel. Socket \nstructure, however, provides more space for caps. \nConsequently, high-performance CPU’s always have a robust \nmulti-stage decoupling solution consisting of a package, \nsocket, and PCB due to high di/dt slew rates [10] as \nhighlighted with a box in figure 3. \n  \nFig. 3.1.  Package Caps on CPU \nPackage \nFig. 3.2.  Board Caps in CPU socket  \nGPU’s primarily using BGA \(Ball Grid Array smaller inductance. So the majority of the \ndecoupling solution of the GPU is located on bottom of board \nas showing in figure 4. Due to the slow slew rate, this kind \ndecoupling solution is enough to handle with graphic \napplications. Furthermore, there is a space limitation to \nallocate more caps. The highlighted core shadow area is the \nmost effective area. Caps beyond this area on board have a \nworse performance because of signal routing around chip.  \n  \nFig. 4.1.  GPU Package  Fig. 4.2.  Board Caps on GPU Board \nThe high performance computing GPU die current profile \nshows a different behaviour because of the huge number of 


narithmetic units. SMX is the major units of GPU. Each of the \nKepler GK110 SMX units feature 192 single-precision CUDA \ncores, and each core has fully pipelined floating-point and \ninteger arithmetic logic units. One of the design goals for \nGK110 SMX was to significantly increase the GPU’s \ndelivered double precision performance, since double \nprecision arithmetic is at the heart of many HPC applications.  \nFigure 5 shows a current segment when GK110 is running \nthe Linpack performance benchmark [11]. Overall, the SMX ncurrent is composed of several units. When all units current \nare combined together, the dynamic power shows a very fast \ncurrent slew up to about 15 clock periods. This slew rate is \nmuch faster than graphic application which causes a new \nchallenge for GPU power delivery design. \nFig. 5.  GK110 SMX Dynamic Current Profile \nIII. POWER NOISE SIMULATION & MEASUREMENT \nThe impact of faster die current variation can be studied by \npower delivery simulation. A simulation model is introduced \nas shown in figure 6 \(there is no package cap Sigrity PowerSI. Die current is \nsplit into dynamic current and leakage current which is \nmodelled as a voltage control resistor.  \n \nFig. 6. Power Delivery Analysis Model for GPU \nA 5-phase buck converter is used as power supply on board. \nBuck converter is a non-linear PWM system. Accurate \ntransistor level model is difficult to get from vender. In this \npaper a linear model is used to model the buck converter. \nSmall signal linear model cannot present the no-linear PWM \nbehaviour and related ripple noise. But it’s accurate enough to nmodel the response of on-die di/dt event. In conjunction with \nsimulation, we measure the silicon noise on die.   \nComputing Applications \n\(~15 ns 70 ns Current for Graphic Application vs Computing Applications \nTo analyse the impact of different current slew rates on \nvoltage noise, a simple step current stimulus is assumed with \nsame the current value but different slew rate as showing in \nfigure 7. The current slew for a CUDA application is 15ns and \n15 clock periods n859\n70ns for graphical applications. The switching current is from \n10A into 130A.  \nFigure 8 is the simulated 1\nst\n droop on-die noise with step \ncurrent load. It can be seen that the biggest noise happens in n1\nst\n droop. That is, a faster slew rate causes a bigger 1\nst\n noise \ndrop. The 2\nnd\n and 3\nrd\n noise droops however, are almost the \nsame. This means that the middle to low frequency caps on \nboard are enough, but the high-frequency decoupling solution \nwhich mainly handles the fast 1\nst\n droop noise is not enough. \nBecause of the space limitation on core shadow area on board, \nadding package caps is a common and effective way to nimprove the decoupling. \n \nFig.8. On-die Noise with Step Current Stimulus \nTo verify the accuracy of simulation models, noise \ncorrelation was done by measurement as well. On die noise \ncan be measured through the sense line on the board with the \nright termination to eliminate sense line transmission line nreflections. Figure 9 shows the noise probing point on board \nhighlighted with red circle. \n \nFig. 9. Probing Point for On-die Noise Measurement \n \n \nFig. 10 \(1 b Waveform \(c GPU is running Linpack applications. It correlates \nvery well thus verifying the model accuracy. There is about \n170mv of noise which deeply affects the GPU performance.  \nIV. PACKAGE CAP STUDY \nAdding package capacitors is a common and effective way \nto reduce high frequency noise droops. For the BGA type \npackage normally package caps can be added into three \ndifferent locations: die side, land side or embedded within npackage. Embedded caps can be mounted underneath the GPU \nchip which can deeply decrease the loop inductance But this \nmethod has yield issues when too many caps need to be \nembedded. So embedded cap technology on package was not \nconsidered at first.  \nFigure 11 shows the possible cap location for both die and \nland side Top of package caps have enough room to allocate \ndie side caps, and there is no height limitation. This is nprecisely the key advantage of die side caps. The connection \nbetween the caps and major power plane however, is \nchallenging because of the usual I/O interfaces around the \nchip. This poor connection will cause additional inductance \nand impact the performance of these caps. \nAs for the bottom layer of package, there are some small \ngaps already between the core area and I/O area. These areas \nare reserved for via connections which are a perfect place to \nput land side caps. Another way is to depopulate some power \nand ground balls to add more caps. This, however, will reduce \nthe power and ground ball connection between board and \npackage. \n nFig. 11.1.  Cap location on die side Fig. 11.2. Cap location on land side \n \nConsidering the height limitation of the package balls, a \nlow profile 0402 is the biggest size which can be used as land \nside cap Figure 12 shows the impedance difference without \ncaps, with 40x1uF die side caps and with 40x1uF land side ncaps. As excepted, package caps can deeply reduce the \nimpedance from 5MHz to 50MHz. Table I show the nimpedance at 20 MHz can improve from 3.68 mohm to 0.839 \nmohm which is close to the low frequency load line nimpedance. Low frequency load line is about 0.8 mohm when \nthe noise budget is 10% of 1v normal voltage and max current \nis 130A. \nAnother consideration is that package caps on the top are a \nlittle worse than package 


caps on the bottom. This is because \ncaps on the bottom layer are directly connected to the power \nCap location Cap location \n860\nand ground planes while top layer caps need to cut additional \npower planes to connect the capacitors.  \n \nFig. 12.  Impedance Profile w/o Package Cap \nTABLE I: impedance value \nCase nWithout package \ncap \n40x1uF on \nPackage top \n40x1uF on \npackage bottom \nImpedance @ \n20MHz \n3.69 mohm 1.13 mohm 0.839 mohm \nThe cap number can be decided by time domain simulation. \nFigure 13 shows the on die noise for the step current with \n40x1uF on the package bottom side. It’s noticed the 1st droop \nis almost close into 2\nnd\n droop. So 40x0402 1uF are enough to \ncontrol the droop.  \n \nFig. 13. On-die Noise with Step Current nDifferent cap values can be compared. Figure 14 is the \nimpedance profile with 40x0.47uF and 40x1uF. We can see \nthat 1uF has a better impedance performance than 0.47uF; \nespecially on the frequency band from 5MHz to 10MHz. 1uF \nis the maximum cap value for low profile 0402 size for \ntemperature and pricing considerations. \n n \nFig. 14.  Impedance profile for 1uF vs 0.47uF \nTwo kind of low ESL capacitors are studied as well by nsimulation. One is a reverse geometry cap. Another is a three-\nterminal cap. The inner structure of a three-terminal capacitor \nfeeds through the capacitor to make sure its ground impedance \nquite low. Due to this structure, 3 terminal capacitor has a \ngood noise suppression effect at the high frequency range of \nup to several hundred MHz. Figure 15 shows the impedance \nprofile with 40x1uF reverse geometric cap and 40x1uF 3-\nterminal cap. Take the 20MHz frequency for example which \nis close to cap self-resonant frequency, Table II shows the \nimpedance value for different kinds of cap. It shows 3-termial \ncaps have a best performance. \n nFig. 15.  Impedance profile with low ESL caps \n \nTABLE II: impedance value \nCap Type Standard MLCC \nReverse nGeometric Cap \n3-terminal Cap \nImpedance @ \n20MHz \n0.839 mohm 0.657 mohm 0.380 mohm \n \nConsidering the package design and cap cost, low ESL caps \nare not used since 40x1uF MLCC is enough to control 1\nst\n \ndroop and 2\nnd\n droops. Figure 16 shows a picture of a package \nwith land side caps. \n \nFig.16. GK110 Package with Land Side Cap \nV. PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT \nFigure 17 shows the simulated noise with and without \n40x1uF caps on the land side of package under a linpack \ncurrent profile. It shows the die noise can improve form \n153.5mv to 107.4mv. It’s about 30% noise improvement with \n1.0v normal voltage.  \nPackage cap \n1st droop noise \n2nd droop noise \n861\n Fig. 17. Simulated noise w/o package cap \nFigure 18 is the measurement noise improvement with \n40x1uF land side package cap. There is about a 55mv noise \nreduction which matches well with simulation In the lab, \nmeasurements show that the improved noise can translate to \n150MHz of GPU operational clock frequency.  \n \n \nFig. 18.

By parameterizing our code, each\nprocess will run on a separate data that is assigned to it by\nthe code. If the number of processes is larger than the number\nof available nodes, each node will run more than one process.\nThe number of processes is fixed in advance before the run\ntime.\nD. Results\nIn our first set of experiments, we use 4000 items from\nUS census 1990 data set. We compare three methods: ran-\ndom projection LSH denoted by DKMA-RP in the figures,\nspectral hashing \(DKMA-SH of\nthe approximated Gram matrix. To do so, we set the Hilbert\ncurve window width as n/2k, where n is data set size and k\nis the number of hash function bits in LSH. The approximated\nGram matrix size using k for LSH is n2/2k, where 2k is the\nnumber of buckets, assuming all buckets have the same size.\nAt the same time, the approximated Gram matrix size using\nHilbert curve is n× winWidth = n× \(n/2k 9\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\nk\nF\nro\nb\nen\niu\ns\nn\no\nrm\nDKMA-SH\nHilbert Curve\nOrginal Matrix\n\(a 9\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\nk\nF\nro\nb\nen\niu\ns\nn\no\nrm\nDKMA-RP\nHilbert Curve\nOrginal Matrix\n\(b accuracy on DKMA Algorithm, it achieves high accuracy using spectral hashing and Hilbert curve.\nE. Results for Accuracy\nFigure 2 shows the results using the 4000 data points. In\nFigures 2\(a b obtained using\ndifferent values of k. As k increases, the accuracy decreases.\nUsing Hilbert curve or DKMA-SH and for k < 6, we maintain\na reasonable accuracy that is more than 90% of the Frobenius\nnorm of the full Gram matrix. If we use Johnson-Lindenstrauss\nlemma, we find that log1/p 4000 < 6, and hence p < 0.25 the\nlow probability for two far points to collide. Moreover, from\nthe figures, Hilbert curve and DKMA-SH out perform DKMA-\nRP.\nF. Results for Memory Consumption\nWe have shown previously that our proposed DKMA\nalgorithm reduces the quadratic complexity for computing\nthe Gram matrix, down to sub-quadratic. In Figure 3, the\napproximated Gram matrix size is drawn in log scale, it is\nthe same for all methods at the same value of k, given that\nWH?curve = n/2\nkLSH . At k = 5, we use a space for the\napproximated Gram matrix that is 3.57% of the full Gram\nmatrix size, and at k = 6 we use only 1.78%, both k = 5 and\nk = 6 give a Frobenius norm more than 90% of the full Gram\nmatrix using spectral hashing or Hilbert curve.\nThe advantage of using LSH over Hilbert curve is the dis-\ntributed property of LSH. Each process handles a bucket\nindependently, and in this case, our method using LSH is\nscalable. If we have enough nodes, such that, each node will\nhandle one bucket at most, and if we ignore the communication\nand the synchronization overheads, we will get a speedup up\nto 2k, where k is the number of hash bits, and 2k is the total\nnumber of buckets.\nG. Results for Large-Scale Data\nIn Figure 4, the results of processing one million data items\nfrom US census data 1990, this is done using MPI on cluster\nas been explained before. This size is not scalable using the\nbrute-force way, 1 million × 1 million = 1 trillion of space\nand computations are required for the Gram matrix using the\nbrute-force. Hilbert curve is not scalabe as well, as it needs\nthe whole approximated Gram matrix stored in place. In LSH,\nwe have independent sub-problems to be processed, which are\nthe buckets. Since the naive way and the method using Hilbert\ncurve are not scaled to this size, we show only the results for\nour method using locality sensitive hashing. From the figure,\nspectral hashing out performs random projection, and both\ngive us significant reduction im memory requirements..\nV. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK\nA. Conclusions\nKernel-based machine learning algorithms require O\(n2 similarity matrix that\nuses a kernel function to compute the similarity between each\npair of points. This complexity is infeasible and unscalable\nwhen dealing with massive data sets. Our proposed method\nis distributed that solves the scalability problem. The idea is\nto hash the input points using LSH, then generate sub-Gram\nmatrix of each bucket.\nWe have implemented our method on a cluster using the Mes-\nsage Passing Interface \(MPI 


processes, because we divide the data into buckets\nwhich are processed independently. The accuracy is dependent\non the value of the number of hash bits k, as k increases\naccuracy decreases, but we showed that we can fix k at a\nmaximum value of log1/p n, where n is the data set size, and\np is the low probability for two far points to collide. In the\nsame time, we maintain an accuracy that is more than 90%.\nB.

One of other replicas is \nsent to a server in the same rack and last one is sent to a server \nof different rack. The replicas are called local and remote \nreplication respectively. The replication process uses bucket \nrelay method. The process also has available bandwidth limit \nof replication to avoid network resource starvation.  \n \(19 execution time model of \na single rack cluster and a multiple rack cluster. Replication \ntime is equal to the minimum of disk writing time and \nreplication time. In one-rack cluster environment, we just \nconsider local replication only. However, in multi-rack \nenvironment, we should care of remote replication. In this \npaper we describe replication up to 3 replica cases because 3-\nreplica-configuration is the most popular configuration in the \nHadoop community [17].  \n \(20 in \nthe cluster. Therefore for a given server, we can calculate \nwriting data size by multiplication of number of replicas and \nreduce output data size divided by number of nodes in the \ncluster. As shown in Equation 20 we can get reduce disk \nwriting time by dividing the reduce output size by disk \nsequential writing speed. We can get the writing speed by \nrunning disk benchmark program. \nSince one reduce makes one output file, the cluster has Nreduces \nreplication chains totally.

Since \nreplication speed is limited by a server’s local network \nbandwidth, we should focus on that how many concurrent \nreplications the single has.  \nWith Equation 8, we approximated a number of concurrent \nreduces per server at a given time point.  \n   \(21 22 23 nFor a single server’s perspective, it performs Nrep_locals of \nconcurrent reduce replications at a given time point because its \nrole is both a replication initiator and a replication relayer for \nother servers.

Therefore, \naverage replication speed is the minimum number of pre-\ndefined replication speed limit and available bandwidth value nIn Equation 23, we got the available bandwidth by dividing the \nserver’s local bandwidth by the active replication channel \nnumber.

MODEL EVEALUATION  \nA. Environment and parameter setting \nTo evaluate our model’s correctness, we set up a cluster \nwhich had up to 160 servers and ran our MapReduce program \non the cluster. The cluster consisted of 4 racks and each of \nthem had 40 servers. Each rack had its own local switch. And \nall servers in the rack connected to the switch. The local \nswitches were connected to a global switch to communicate \neach other. We installed Hadoop TaskTracker and HDFS \nDataNode in every server of the cluster. We prepared \n2013 5th International Conference on Computer Science and 


Information Technology \(CSIT and \nNameNode to keep them interfering from MapReduce data \noperation. In summary, we used 162 Servers and 5 local \nnetwork switches in total. All servers had same specification \nand software configuration. We listed our cluster’s detailed \nspecification in Table 2.  \nOur model equation needs values from Hadoop, HDFS, a ncluster and a MapReduce application. We summarized our \nexperiment’s Hadoop, HDFS, cluster values in Table 3 nBenchmark programs were used for disk and network \nperformance measurement. We used Bonnie++ [18] for disk nI/O performance and Netperf[19] for network bandwidth. \n \nB. Parameter measurement from real application running \nWe ran our MapReduce program as a model validation \nprogram. The program reads records from input files and \nencrypts the each record in map phase, then sorts and writes \nmap result to HDFS as output files in reduce phase. The \nprogram is easy to observe copy and reduce phase’s network \naffection because the program’s map output data size is \nsufficiently big. In addition, since the program does not need \nto be run in a single reduce configuration, we can observe \nmulti-reduces’ contribution to Hadoop. \nOur model also needs application specific parameters. We \ngot the values from trials of various configurations in a small \ncluster. The cluster should be one wave map phase with full \noccupied map slot to get exact copy phase execution time. In naddition, sufficient number of map or reduce servers are \nrequired to examine performance limit of each phase’s process. \nIn our case, we used two configurations; 1 server for maps and \n4 servers for reduces and vice versa. We listed the parameters \nfrom the trial in Table 4. \nIn the next section, we will compare our model’s predicted \nvalues to the values from our real application running \nmeasurements under various configurations. To get the real \nmeasurement value, we used an on-line Hadoop Map-reduce \nprogress report that users can see when they executes \nMapReduce job. The report periodically informs map’s and \nreduce’s progress in percentage manner. For map reports, \n100% means whole maps are finished. For example, if a job \nhas 2 map waves, and 1 map wave just finished, then the \nprogress is 50%. In reduce phase, progress is divided by 3 nparts. Roughly from 0% to 33% represents copy phase \nprogress, from 34% to 66% shows sort phase progress, and nfinal part means reduce phase progress. Since Hadoop gets \nthis progress from individual Tasktrackers and reports average \nto user, the report has some error compared to real progress. \nHowever, we used this value because users get this report \neasily and our results showed our model still could grasp \nHadoop’s scalability despite of this kind of error. \nC. Experimentand result \nWe ran the application in 9 different cluster configurations \nto investigate Hadoop’s scalability characteristics and \ncompared them to our model’s prediction. We designed cases \n1 to 4 to evaluate our model’s scalability under a single rack \ncondition. From case 1 to 2, input size is fixed and only a \nnumber of servers in the cluster increased from 20 to 40. From ncase 2 and 3, only the number of reduces increased from 20 to \n40. Therefore, we expected the job execution time decrease \nfrom case 1 to 3. Case 4 had the same settings to the case 3 but \ndoubled input size Therefore, if Hadoop scales well, Job \nexecution time will just be doubled in the case 4 compared to \nthe case 3. Case 5, 6, 7s purpose was the same to the case 2, 3, \n4. Only difference was doubled number of racks Similarly, \ncase 8 and 9’s purpose was same to the case 2 to 3 except the \nnumber of racks. \nWe used case 4 and 5, 7 and 8 to examine Hadoop’s \nscalability at the rack increasing point. Therefore, only the \nnumber of racks, thus the number of servers changed from 40 \nTABLE II.

APPLICATION SPECIFIC PARAMETERS \nmthput \(MB/s 0.4884\nrthput\(MB/s and Information Technology \(CSIT case 7 to 8. If \nHadoop has ideally linear scalability, the job execution time \nbecomes half at each transition. \nTable 5 shows all of settings and results. In Table 5, ‘R’ \nmeans real measurement of execution time and ‘M’ means our \nmodel predicted execution time. A comparison graph in Figure \n7 plots Table 5’s job execution time Tj of ‘R’ and ‘M’ in Table \n5. ‘R’ and ‘M’ shows the same pattern. And an average \npercentage of value difference ‘R’ from ‘M’ to ‘R’ is 5.2% \nand standard deviation of the percentage is 4.86. This shows nthat our model can describes real job’s execution time under \nmulti rack conditions. \nFrom case 1 to 2, our model showed map execution time \nbecame half but reduce execution time is same because input \nsize and number 


of reducers does not change. From case 2 to 3, \nexecution time decreased. As we expected, from 3 to 4, the job nexecution time roughly doubled because input data size was \ndoubled while a number of reducers was fixed This means \nHadoop scales well in the single rack environment.  \nAn interesting point is that case 5 was slower than case 4 \neven the number of servers were doubled therefore map phase \nexecution time became half The result is due to remote copy \ncost which introduced first from case 5. Our prediction shows \nthat case 5’s Copy execution time is almost 4.5 times longer \ncompared to case 4. However, real measurement showed that ncase 4’s copy time is longer than case 5. This was caused by \ntwo wave map phase execution of case 4. As shown in figure 4, \ncopy starts immediately after first map wave finishes. Then \nHadoop waits for second map wave’s finish before actual \nsecond copy starts. The Hadoop Mapreduce progress report \nstarts counting copy time when the first copy wave starts and \nfinishes when the last copy wave ends. For this reason, \nobserved copy time is longer than prediction under multi map \nwave conditions even if actual copy size is short. All multi \nwave trial \(case 1, 4, 7 case 5, 6, 7 Hadoop’s \nscalability was similar to what we observed in 1 rack cases.  \nFrom 2 rack configuration to 4 rack configuration \ntransition \(from case 7 to 8 Interesting point is case 8’s reduce phase \ntime decreased even number of inputs and reducers were same nbetween case 7 and 8. This can be explained increased \navailable inter-switch bandwidth for each reducer Because the \nnumber of racks and servers in the cluster doubled, the number \nof reducers which were placed per rack was decreased, \ntherefore, inter switch bandwidth contention for replication \nwas relieved.  \nFrom case 8 to 9 only a number of reducers doubled, \nhowever there were no significant performance improvement. \nOur prediction results shows only sort phase has significant \nimprovement. This implies 40 reduces in case 8 already hit \ninter-node connection limit. This reveals that under multi-rack \ncondition reduce phase has early scalability limit before severs \ncapacity limit due to network limitation. \n \nD. Scale out prediction  \nUnder multi-rack condition, the most important factor for \nscalability is inter-switch bandwidth between local switch and \nglobal switch. We used our model to predict our sample \napplication’s scalability in various inter-switch bandwidth \nconditions.  \nWe defined 4 global network conditions according to inter-\nswitch bandwidth from 100 MB/s to 400 MB/s. And under \neach condition, we defined sub-cases according to a number of nthe cluster’s racks from 1 to 32 racks. In each case, we fixed \ninput data to 3840 blocks. The purpose of this prediction was \nexamine if Hadoop really scales out under a cluster consists of \nmany racks.  \nWe plotted our prediction in Figure 8. According to our \nmodel’s prediction, a 400 MB/s of inter-network bandwidth ncluster required to get ideal scale out performance under our \nconfiguration. However, even in a 100 MB/s inter-network \nbandwidth, a typical cluster for most users, Hadoop was \nscalable. In the previous section, we noticed our application \ndid not scale out well at one rack to two rack cluster size \nincrement due to inter-network limitation. However, Figure 8 \nshowed that from two rack configuration to any more rack nconfiguration, Hadoop scales out well. This was caused by \ncombination of input data and reducers’ uniform distribution \n\( if our assumption holds size for remote copy decreases as \n   TABLE V.

CONCLUSION \n \nIn this paper, we suggested a network aware Hadoop \nperformance model and explored its scalability with the model. \nOur experimental results showed that the model could predict a \njob’s execution with 5 % average error compared to the real \njob measurement within up to 4 rack 160 server clusters in nresolution of second. We could explain the cause of the real job \nmeasurement pattern under various conditions with the model. \nIn addition, with the model, we explored the Hadoop \nscalability characteristic in large clusters under various inter-\nswitch bandwidths and a numbers of reduces which are \nimportant for the scalability. By using the result, we showed \nHadoop scales out well in the typical cluster network nconfigurations, and suggested guidelines for application design \nand Hadoop scalability improvement. \n A 160 server cluster is a sufficiently large cluster for most \nof newly joined users to big data analysis without sufficient \nbudget for cluster and experience. Our model contributes the \nusers to save cost by assisting to analyzing potential of their \ncluster before adding a new server.  \nREFERENCES \n \n[1] J. Dean and S.

desired\nlevel of accuracy by simply increasing the number of steps.\nIn particular, any of Messac’s canonical satisfaction function\ncan be modeled [31].\nIn the VASSAR methodology, the system architect can enter\none-of-a-kind requirement satisfaction rules. However, a\nspreadsheet-based user interface was implemented for rapid\ncoding of multi-step satisfaction functions, which have all the\nsame structure.\nStep 3a Aggregate Requirement Satisfaction—The prefer-\nence domain is hyperdimensional because there is at least one\ndimension per requirement, and in a complex system there\ncan easily be several hundreds or even thousands of require-\nments. Dominated architectures could easily be eliminated\nby means of Pareto analysis, but this is unlikely to reduce\nthe size of the tradespace by much due to the large number\nof requirements. Hence, the problem remains of choosing\nbetween architectures that have very different requirement\n10\nFigure 10. Level 2 VASSAR, step 3a: Aggregate satisfaction\nsatisfaction sets, but seem globally equally attractive. In prac-\ntice, the dimensionality of this domain needs to be reduced in\norder to be able to make a decision concerning the preferred\narchitectures. This requires the use of subjective information\ncapturing stakeholder preferences.\nHence, the last step of the methodology is the reduction of the\ndimensionality of the preference domain through aggregation\nof requirement \(i.e., subobjective then into stakeholder satisfaction. This two-\nstep aggregation process requires the elicitation of a list of\nobjectives and subobjectives from different stakeholders, and\nreduces the dimensionality of the preference domain \(i.e., the\nnumber of metrics Nsh\nto 1 if the relative importance of stakeholders to a central\nstakeholder is introduced. The relative importance of stake-\nholders can be formally computed by applying quantitative\nstakeholder analysis techniques e.g. stakeholder networks\n[32 represents the value of the system\narchitecture to the central stakeholder. The entire process is\nillustrated in Figure 10.\nMathematically, requirement aggregation rules reduce the\ndimensionality of the satisfaction space by using aggregation\nfunctions. Aggregation functions combine arithmetic and\nlogical operators. The simplest and most commonly used\narithmetic operator is the weighted average. For example, the\nsatisfaction of a stakeholder is given by a weighted average\nof the satisfaction of its objectives. More sophisticated arith-\nmetic operators are also possible \(see for example Yager’s\nordered weighted averaging operator or Fortin’s gradual num-\nbers [33], [34 type, such as the at-least-n-out-of-\nk condition: “the stakeholder is satisfied if 3 or more of these\n4 objectives are satisfied.”\nIn the VASSAR methodology, the system architect can man-\nually define one-of-a-kind aggregation functions. Weighted\naverages can be rapidly coded in from a spreadsheet-based\nuser interface.\nStep 3b: Prepare Explanations—The VASSAR methodology\nprovides a set of explanations that accompany the fuzzy value\nmetric. This is central to the methodology, as it satisfies one\nof its key requirements, namely that of showing traceability\nof the value delivery loop. Explanation rules keep track of\nTable 3.

However, architectural decisions can affect these in-\nstrument capabilities in non-trivial ways that are encoded in\nlogical rules. For example, temporal resolution and spatial\nresolution both depend on the orbital parameters. Data\nquality also depends on the orbital parameters.

This happens when an architecture does not meet one\nor more requirements that are defined as critical to provide\nvalue, or when the instruments are put in environments where\nthey cannot operate.

Architectures with one satellite per plane high-\nlighted on the tradespace\nthe tradespace just by clicking on the corresponding points\non a chart. For example, we can obtain the details of the non-\ndominated architectures in Figure 12 by clicking on them,\nas shown in Table 5. Note that all non-dominated architec-\ntures have 800km dawn-dusk SSO, and they are monolithic\narchitectures \(all instruments are put onto a single spacecraft satellites in the constellation\n\(1 or 2 instrument on non-dominated architectures. This\nis due to the fact that it has a conflicting orbit requirement\nwith the rest of instruments, which results in an unfavorable\nscience-cost trade. In other words adding the IR instrument\nto the suite would require flying the instrument in an AM orbit\ninstead of a dawn-dusk orbit, which would negatively impact\nboth the science output of the other instruments and the cost\nof the platform.\nThe tool can also highlight the regions of the tradespace\nthat correspond to a particular combination of architectural\ndecisions. For example, Figure 13 highlights all architectures\nin which the number of satellites per plane is 1. It is easy to\nsee on this chart that it is impossible to achieve the maximum\nachievable science score with only one satellite per plane, due\nto unsatisfied temporal resolution requirements.\n\(3 advanced support, such as\nautomatic detection of common architectural features in a\nparticular region of the tradespace. For example, if we ask\nthe explanation facility to study the region in which science\nis between 0.01; 0.2], the tool automatically detects that most\nof the architectures in this region have polar, non-SSO orbits,\nas shown in Figure 14.\nFuzzy results—We emphasized earlier the large uncertainty in\nthe system architecting process, and the importance of being\nable to deal with fuzzy numbers in the RBES. It is important\nto note that conceptually, we are using fuzzy numbers for\ntwo slightly different purposes: capturing uncertainty and\ncapturing fuzziness or ambiguity. Uncertainty refers to statis-\ntical uncertainty or randomness, whereas fuzziness refers to\nnon-statistical uncertainty or vagueness. Treating statistical\nuncertainty with interval analysis is provides less information\nthan treating it with probability distribution functions \(pdf example, we are using fuzzy numbers to\n13\nTable 4.

Figure 15 shows the magnitude of\nthe uncertainty for the architectures on the Pareto frontier of\nFigure 12. The sources of uncertainty for cost are mostly\nthe standard errors from the CERs used in the cost estimation\nmodel. The sources of uncertainty for science in this example\nare the use of fuzzy scores to assess requirement satisfaction\n\(each requirement is satisfied at one of five fuzzy levels as\nexplained in the section describing fuzzy numbers.\nIt is important to note that different architectures have dif-\nferent levels of uncertainty. Uncertainty in cost is similar in\nrelative terms \(not in absolute terms mag-\nnitude [35]. However, uncertainty in science is not homoge-\nneous because a requirement fully satisfied is encoded as a\nfuzzy number with mean one and zero width, and a critical\nrequirement that is not satisfied is encoded as a fuzzy number\nwith mean zero and zero width. Thus, for the same score, dif-\nferent uncertainty 


levels are possible: if the score comes from\nsatisfying a few requirements fully and completely missing\nthe rest, uncertainty will be very low; conversely, if the score\ncomes from satisfying all or most of the requirements at an\nintermediate level \(e.g., “Most” or “Some larger.\nSensitivity Analysis—There are several ways of conducting a\nsensitivity analysis in VASSAR:\n1 simply rerunning the tool with different sets of param-\neters. In this section we provide two examples of sensitivity\nanalysis: one concerning the capabilities of the P-band SAR\nto measure soil moisture, and the other one concerning the\nrelative importance of the stakeholder panels.\nA major source of uncertainty in this piece of analysis is the\nability of the P-band SAR to provide useful measurements of\nsoil moisture, which has not yet been proven. The appeal\nof P-band SAR measurements of soil moisture is that of\nincreased soil and vegetation penetration due to the lower\nfrequency. However, most of the signal at this frequency\ncomes from soil roughness, which makes the soil moisture\nretrieval challenging [36]. Hence the question of whether this\ninstrument will be able of producing useful measurements of\n14\nFigure 14. Effect of orbit inclination on science and cost\nFigure 15. Fuzzy Science vs fuzzy lifecycle cost for non-\ndominated architectures \(uniform weights instrument does\nnot have this capability. The details of the non-dominated\narchitectures under this scenario are provided in Table 6. We\nnote several changes with respect to Table 5. First, the LSAR\ninstrument appears much more often because its combination\nwith LRADIO is the only one that can provide soil moisture\nmeasurements that satisfy the needs of the weather commu-\nnity in terms of both accuracy and spatial resolution. The\nPSAR instrument still appears in the high-cost region of the\nPareto frontier, because it is the only instrument with the\nhigh penetration capability. However, it disappears of the\nlower cost of the Pareto frontier because the extra science\ndoes not compensate the cost of developing it for the given\nstakeholder preferences. It is also noticeable that the high\ncost non-dominated architectures have now more than one\nsatellite because architectures flying the two SAR on the same\nplatform are dominated \(they are too costly become three times as\nimportant as the other panels. The details about the non-\ndominated architectures in this case are shown in Table 7.\nThis change in stakeholder preferences brings forth a major\nchange in the architectural tradespace: the best architectures\nin the high-science region of the tradespace now include\nthe IR instrument, contrary to what happened for uniform\nweights. In order to get the maximum science output out\nFigure 16. Propagation of uncertainty in payload mass to\npayload cost.\nof the IR instrument it is necessary to fly it in an AM orbit,\nwhich impacts both the science output of other instruments\nand the cost of the spacecraft.\nMore advanced variants of this option allow to compute the\nthreshold value for a parameter that makes the non-dominated\nset change. For example, the tool determined in this case that\nfor wECOwi < 2.59 the best architectures remain similar to\nthose presented in Table 5, whereas for wECOwi ? 2.59, the\nbest architectures switch to those presented in Table 7. Some\ndecision makers are more comfortable with this kind of result\nthan plain results, because they feel that they can evaluate\nthe certainty with which the statement wECOwi < 2.59 is true\nmore easily than they can assign weights to the different\nstakeholder panels.\n2 encoding any parameter as a fuzzy value. For instance,\nthe mass or the accuracy of an instrument can also be encoded\nas a fuzzy number with a certain range of values, and these\nuncertainties will be propagated to the cost and science met-\nrics. An example of the propagation of uncertainty in mass\nto cost is shown in Figure 16. The triangles represent the\ntriangular membership functions for mass and cost. Note\nthat the altitudes of these triangles are notional and do not\ncorrespond to the values in the axis. The red line shows the\ncorrespondence between scalar mass and scalar cost through\na parametric relationship embedded in the tool.\n3 merit change\nwhen each variable is changed. Note that gradients or pseudo-\ngradients cannot generally be defined in this local search\nprocess as some of the variables are categorical. Instead, rules\nare created that automatically enumerate all the architectures\nthat differ from the reference architecture in just one archi-\ntectural aspect. For example, an instruments is added to or\nremoved from the payload, or the LTAN is changed from DD\nto AM. We used VASSAR to look around the architecture\n#669, highlighted in Table 5. Eleven architectures were thus\nautomatically enumerated and evaluated. They are shown in\nFigure 17. This kind of results can be useful to determine the\noptimal evolution of an architecture, such as in determining\nan optimal descoping option in the event of a downward\nbudget.\n15\nTable 6.

Local search around architecture #669, high-\nlighted on Table 5\n4 CONCLUSION\nThis paper has presented a methodology to assess the value\nof a system architecture using RBES Such methodology can\nbe used in the context of automatic architectural tradespace\nexploration to develop the part of computational tools that\nautomatically evaluates the architectures being generated. An\nexample of such tool was shown in the context of Earth Ob-\nserving Satellite Systems \(EOSS is\ndivided in two parts. First, the advantages and disadvantages\nof VASSAR with respect to the state-of-the-art of system\narchitecting tools is discussed. Second, the next steps in this\nresearch project are outlined.\nAdvantages and disadvantages of VASSAR\nThe following are advantages  the\nVASSAR methodology with respect to other frameworks:\n\(1  delivery\nloop. All requirements are directly traceable to stakeholder\nneeds. All capabilities are directly traceable to architectural\ndecisions.\n\(2  e.g., sci-\nence and engineering back-\ngrounds, simply because it is the way in which the human\nmind works.\n\(3  the domain-specific\nknowledge from the domain-independent knowledge, which\ntranslates into increased scalability and reusability, and facil-\nitates task allocation between system architects and software\nengineers.\n\(4  lessons learned: it serves as\na repository of knowledge to conserve expertise, and it also\nuses the lessons learned in the form of logical rules to evaluate\nsystem architectures.\n\(5  delivery loop facilitates more\n16\noptimal task allocation between man \(the system architect the computational tool architectures and through the use of the text-\nbased and graphics-based explanation facility. The system\narchitect feeds the tool with knowledge, guides the tradespace\nexploration process, and makes all non-objective decisions.\n\(6  of recursive algorithms, which\nare at the core of modeling emergence, which in turn is the\norigin of value.\n\(7  8  a computational price, which is only\nworth it if the knowledge base is likely to evolve.\n\(9  slow when the number of rules is very\nlarge.\n\(10  the expert knowledge \(e.g. lessons learned specific\npurpose: evaluating system architectures in the context of\nautomatic architectural tradespace exploration. Using this\nmethodology, a tool was created to evaluate architectures in\nthe context of Earth Observing Satellite Systems. Some of\nthe next steps concern the methodology itself, while others\nconcern this tool.\nConcerning the methodology, the extension of VASSAR’s\nexplanation facility with more advanced features requires\nthe incorporation of a machine learning layer on top of the\nRBES. This type of hybrid AI tool is seen as a potentially\nfruitful area of research. Furthermore, this paper focused\non the use of RBES for the valuation portion of the system\narchitecting process. RBES can be used in other aspects of\nthe architecting process. A similar framework has been cre-\nated that allows automatic enumeration of several canonical\ntypes of architectures using RBES [37]. This framework is\ncontinuously being improved with more efficient algorithms\nof enumerating certain classes of architectures. Finally, the\ncurrent VASSAR implementation is restrictive in terms of\nrepresentation of architectures, as they need to be represented\nas lists of pairs decision-value. A more advanced version\nof the tool could allow importing architectures expressed in\nmore powerful representation tools such as SysML or OPM.\nConcerning the tool, the knowledge base can be improved in\nseveral points, but not all improvements would have the same\nimpact on the fidelity of the tool. For instance, it is unlikely\nthat a more accurate ?V budget would result in very different\nresults. Two examples where the improvement would yield a\nhigh return in modeling fidelity are discussed below.\nFirst, the spacecraft design algorithm could benefit from a\nhigher-fidelity configuration module that accounts for the\nposition of the main spacecraft components and provides\nmore accurate estimations of the dimensions and moments\nof inertia of the spacecraft.\nSecond, the cost model uses cost estimating relationships\n\(CERs are old and have very large standard errors.\nHigher fidelity cost models could be used instead of these\nTable

Bus cost is based on the parametric relationships\nprovided in SMAD \([35 these parametric are based\non the spacecraft mass budget, a spacecraft design module\nthat estimates the mass and power budgets of each spacecraft\nprecedes the cost estimation module.\nThe spacecraft design module is iterative because of the\ncouplings between different subsystems. For example, the\nmass of the spacecraft affects the design of the ADCS through\nthe size of the reaction wheels and the amount of propellant\namongst others, and these feed back into the computation of\nthe spacecraft mass. In practice, three iterations are sufficient\nto make the design process converge to a precision of less\nthan a kg.\nAn overview of the spacecraft design module is provided in\nFigure 20.\nOnce the mass, power, and delta-V budgets have been cal-\nculated, the different components of lifecycle cost shown\nin Figure 19 can be computed using the cost estimating\nrelationships in SMAD.\n18\nFigure 18.

There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
