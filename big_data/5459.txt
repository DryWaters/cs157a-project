conclusion and M 3 the strengthening clause linguistically introduced by the expression all the more  In the following we discuss the semantics that can be attached to this strengthening effect comparing various interpretations in particular with respect to the different semantics of fuzzy gradual rules We focus on the interpretation as co-variation constraints across the whole data recalled in Section II-C and in particular on the ranking compliant data subset approach see Section II-C.3 and Deﬁnition 6 that identiﬁes data subsets on which the ranking constraint holds In Section III-D we discuss the strengthening effect for the fuzzy implication interpretation of fuzzy gradual rules A Difference with Conjunctive Gradual Rules It is rst important to underline the difference between strengthened rules and conjunctive rules of the form  M 1 012 M 3   M 2  With the considered illustrative example this rule would be the closer the wall and the higher the speed the harder the brakes are applied  Both rules can hold for a given data set still their semantics differ Indeed for such conjunctive gradual rules M 3 plays a causal role on M 2 and in the co-variation interpretation of fuzzy gradual rules it imposes a strong constraint it requires that the rankings induced by the three itemsets M 1  M 2 and M 3 are identical or highly consistent In the strengthening case the ranking constraint only concerns the two itemsets M 1 and M 2  This restricts to a lesser extent the number of objects on which the rule applies the reinforcement effect rather applies on the rule M 1  M 2 than on M 2  even if it does not exclude a causal effect of M 3 on M 2  B Constraint on Variation Strength One interpretation of the strengthening effect considers it as a constraint on the variation intensity of M 2  when the rankings according to M 1 and M 2 agree the relation all the more is understood as a intensiﬁcation of the variations of the attributes involved in M 2 according to M 3 values Considering the illustrative example the closer the wall the harder the brakes are applied all the more the higher the speed  this interpretation means that rst an increase in the wall closeness implies an increase in the braking strength and second that the increase i s correlated to high speed Formally this interpretation of strengthening can be expressed as the conjunction of fuzzy gradual rules a rule M 1  M 2  and a rule of the form M 3   M 2 where  M 2 denotes M 2 variations C Reinforced Presence Another interpretation evaluates the strengthening inﬂuence of M 3 on the rule M 1  M 2 as the fact that the rule is better satisﬁed when the candidate objects are the ones possessing M 3 rather than when the whole d ata set is considered it should be easier to apply the rule when one focuses on data possessing M 3  Equivalently the strengthening inﬂuence of M 3 on the rule M 1  M 2 is interpreted through the extent to which M 3 is possessed by objects satisfying the rule The reinforcement is thus used to partition the data considering a fuzzy partition and to compare the rule validity on a data subset and the whole data set this interpretation combines the fuzzy gradual rule with a fuzzy presence condition For this interpretation the fuzzy gradual rule approach through ranking compliant data subsets is in particular relevant it is indeed easy to measure a reinforced presence of M 3 when the rule M 1  M 2 applies as the method explicitly extracts data subsets for which the rule holds Therefore we will use this method in the following in particular to deﬁne the quality criteria Still the other ranking-based approaches of fuzzy gradual rules also make it possible to take into account a weighted inﬂuence of M 3 presence in the regression case it is possible to modify the R coefﬁcient e.g to give less weights to regression errors that coincide with low presence of M 3 In the ranking correlation approach the penalisation associated to a discordant pair can also depend on the membership degrees to M 3  D Case of Fuzzy Implication Interpretation In the framework of fuzzy gradual rules understood as fuzzy implications satisﬁed individually for each data point a strengthened rule M 1  M 2  M 3 can be interpreted following different lines Indeed in a such framework it makes sense to consider an additional attribute in the data base whose values are the truth values of the implication M 1  M 2  i.e i  M 1  x  M 2  x  for all x D  The strengthened rule can then be understood as gradual relation between the membership degree to M 3 and the new additional attribute meaning that the reinforcement holds if the implication is all the truer as M 3 is true The strengthened rule is then identical to the cascaded fuzzy gradual rule M 3   M 1  M 2  in the fuzzy implication interpretation of gradual rules The support of such a rule can then be computed by transposing Equation 1 as  x D i  M 3  x  i  M 1  x  M 2  x   It can be underlined that for s-implications the cascaded rule is equivalent to  M 1 012 M 3   M 2 as the previous quantity equals i    M 3  x  M 1  x  M 2  x  Nowthe ukasiewicz implication i  a b min\(1  a  b 1 is both an rand an s-implication combining the gradual rule interpretation with the previous property It thus bridges the gap between reinforced and conjunctive rules Besides this interpretation sheds new light on the interpretation presented in the previous subsection III-C although the latter does not belong to the logical framework it also considers a fuzzy presence semantics Still the presence of M 3 is not taken into account indi vidually for each data point but it is evaluated globally on the ranking compliant data subset 


IV S TRENGTHENING Q UALITY C RITERIA In this section we describe the quality measures and in particular support and conﬁdence proposed to assess strengthened fuzzy gradual rules according to the semantics described in Section III-C As mentioned previously the ranking compliant data subset recalled in Section II-C.3 appears to be particularly relevant for this interpretation Therefore we exploit its properties in the proposed quality criteria especially the identiﬁcation of subsets of data on which the ranking constraint holds A strengthened rule M 1  M 2  M 3 contains two components namely the fuzzy gradual rule M 1  M 2 and its reinforcement thus it mu st be assessed according to these two elements Therefore we propose to characterize a reinforcement rule both by the support and conﬁdence of the rule M 1  M 2  and by the strengthened support and conﬁdence in reinforcement that measure the quality of the latter In the following we propose deﬁnitions for these criteria A Strengthened Support As in the classic case we propose to deﬁne the support of a strengthened rule by an evaluation of its frequency To that aim we use a sigma-count approach to deﬁne the degree to which M 3 is present among the objects that satisfy the rule M 1  M 2  the higher it is the better the reinforcement holds 1 Deﬁnition More formally we propose the following deﬁnition Deﬁnition 8 The strengthened support of a fuzzy gradual rule R  M 1  M 2  M 3 is deﬁned as s supp  R  max i 1 k  x D  i M 3  x  4 denoting L  D  i i 1 p  the set of all maximal data subsets that can be permuted to satisfy the ranking constraints on M 1 and M 2  Introducing the notation M 3  D    x D  M 3  x   i.e the fuzzy cardinal of D  according to M 3  the support equals s supp  R ax i 1 p M 3  D  i   2 Example Considering the data given in Table I and the R rule the closer the wall the harder the brakes are applied all the more the higher the speed  one has L   1  3  4  7    2  3  4  7    1  3  4  8    2  3  4  8  and M 3  D  1  M 3   1  3  4  7  0  5+0  9+0  8+0  4=2  6  M 3  D  2  M 3   2  3  4  7  0  6+0  9+0  8+0  4=2  7  M 3  D  3  M 3   1  3  4  8  0  5+0  9+0  8+0  7=2  9  and M 3  D  4  M 3   2  3  4  8  0  6+0  9+0  8+0  7=3  Thus the strengthened support is 3 3 Properties It must be underlined that the proposed deﬁnition is not symmetric due to the speciﬁc role of M 3  Besides as discussed in previous section this deﬁnition does not take into account a co-variation of the membership degrees to the strengthening clause M 3 with those of the antecedent and consequent of the rule it uses a sigma-count on M 3 presence This approach is in particular relevant to handle reinforcement by binary attributes as for instance the greater the meat purchase the averager the vegetable purchase all the more if the city is Paris  Such rules can easily be dealt with in this context the membership degrees equal 1 for all objects possessing the attribute One can replace in the previous deﬁnition the sigma-count by a thresholded sigma-count using a user-deﬁned threshold this makes it possible to avoid taking into account objects that are not representative enough of M 3  Lastly as the support deﬁned for classic association rules the following property holds Property 1 The strengthened support is anti-monotone with respect to the size of the M 3 itemset Proof if one considers two rules R 1  M 1  M 2  M 3 and R 2  M 1  M 2  M 4 with M 3  M 4  it holds that s supp  R 1   s supp  R 2   Indeed the two rules R 1 and R 2 have the same basic form and thus the same set L of maximal ranking compliant data subsets Moreover for any x D  M 3  x   M 4  x   Indeed itemsets are interpreted as conjunction of the items they contain Thus noting M the itemset such that M  M 4  M 3  M 4  M 3  M and  x M 4  x    M 3  x  M  x  015 M 3  x   Thus it holds that D  i D M 4  D  i  015 M 3  D  i   which leads to the desired result This property will in particular be used for the mining algorithm described in Section V B Strengthened Conﬁdence The conﬁdence in the strengthened fuzzy gradual rule then measures the relevance of the strengthening effect as compared to the non strengthened rule M 1  M 2  1 Deﬁnition Following the classic scheme of conﬁdence deﬁned as the quotient between the rule support by the antecedent support a rst deﬁnition could consist in comparing the strengthened support as deﬁned in Equation 4 to the support of the non strengthened rule this would lead to deﬁne s conf  R  s supp  M 1  M 2  M 3  supp  M 1  M 2 max i 1 p M 3  D  i   max i 1 p D  i   Now this deﬁnition is not satisfactory because it compares values that may be obtained from different data subsets the numerator is obtained from the ranking compliant subset with maximal M 3 fuzzy cardinality whereas the denominator comes from the ranking compliant subset with maximal cardinality Now these subsets need not be the same and the quotient of two values corresponding to different objects does not have an intuitive meaning Therefore we propose to compute the quotient between M 3 fuzzy cardinality and cardinality for each candidate data subset individually and to then take the maximal value Deﬁnition 9 The strengthened conﬁdence of a fuzzy gradual rule R  M 1  M 2  M 3 is deﬁned as s conf  R  max i 1 p M 3  D  i  D  i  5 denoting L  D  i i 1 p  the set of all maximal data subsets that can be permuted to satisfy the ranking constraints on M 1 and M 2  


This strengthened conﬁdence implements the semantics proposed in Section III-C evaluating the average membership degree to M 3 among data satisfying the ranking constraint Several data subsets satisfying the condition we consider the maximal obtained value This choice implies that we consider that the conﬁdence can be established from any data subset on which the strengthened rule can rely and that it is sufﬁcient that there exists one such subset In the previous example that considers the rule the closer the wall the harder the brakes are applied all the more the higher the speed  all maximal subsets D  i have the same cardinality 4 the strengthened conﬁdence equals 3/4  0.75 2 Properties It can be noted that as the strengthened support and contrary to the classic conﬁdence measure the following property holds Property 2 The strengthened conﬁdence is anti-monotone with respect to the size of the M 3 itemset Proof denoting as previously R 1  M 1  M 2  M 3 et R 2  M 1  M 2  M 4 with M 3  M 4  it holds that M 4  D  i  015 M 3  D  i  as previously Dividing both sides by D  i   and taking the maximum over i  this leads to the antimonotony property This allows to directly extract strengthened fuzzy gradual rules with high conﬁdence that satisfy a user deﬁned threshold instead of having to lter out the rules with low conﬁdence after they have been extracted it makes it possible to efﬁciently mine strengthened rules of interest C Other Quality Criteria Other classic quality criteria for association rule evaluation see e.g 10  can als o be e x tended and i n p ar ticular the lift measure 11 t h e s t r engt hened s uppor t a nd con dence measures are sensitive to the frequency of the M 3 itemset in the same manner as classic support and conﬁdence are sensitive to the frequency of the conclusion itemset whereas the lift criterion is not In particular the lift criterion makes it possible to reject candidate association rules that conclude to modalities present in all data Likewise the aim of the strengthened lift is to reject reinforcement clauses based on modalities such that  x  M 3  x 1  Deﬁnition 10 The strengthened lift of a fuzzy gradual rule R  M 1  M 2  M 3 is deﬁned as s lift max i 1 p M 3  D  i  D  i   D M 3  D  6 denoting L  D  i i 1 p  the set of all maximal data subsets that can be permuted to satisfy the ranking constraints on M 1 and M 2  It compares the average membership degree to M 3 among data satisfying the ranking constraint to the global average membership degree to M 3 across the whole data set V A LGORITHM TO M INE S TRENGTHENED F UZZY R ULES The problem is then to extract all strengthened fuzzy gradual rules whose support conﬁdence strengthened support and strengthened conﬁdence are larger than user-deﬁned thresholds The rules looked for are maximal rules i.e those that contain the highest possible number of fuzzy gradual items while satisfying the thresholds This maximality constraint applies to all three itemsets constituting antecedent consequent and strengthening clause A strengthened fuzzy gradual rule M 1  M 2  M 3 contains two components the fuzzy gradual rule M 1  M 2 and the strengthened clause M 3 that must satisfy the support and conﬁdence constraints independently Thus the mining algorithm is made of two steps the rst one consists in identifying the fuzzy gradual rules that satisfy the support and conﬁdence constraints the second aims at establishing the strengthened itemsets that can reinforce these rules The rst step can be performed using the GRITE algorithm 8 t hat e xt r act s a l l fr equent fuzzy gr adual i t e ms et s w i t h t h ei r support Moreover it identiﬁes data subsets that can be sorted so as to satisfy the ranking constraints expressed by these itemsets It can be noted that the deﬁnition of strengthened support and conﬁdence Equations 4 and 5 actually depend on the frequent itemsets M 1  M 2 and not on the rules M 1  M 2  Thus they do not require the identiﬁcation of the causality relations between the items constituting the extracted itemsets The second step that aims at establishing the strengthening itemsets for the previous itemsets follows the principles of the APRIORI algorithm using the strengthened support and conﬁdence as quality measure strengthened itemsets are extracted in a level-wise approach progressively building the itemsets of increasing size exploiting the anti-monotony properties of these criteria To that aim given a fuzzy gradual rule R to strengthen or a frequent fuzzy gradual itemset the candidate strengthening itemsets of size k 1 are generated from the candidates of size k  using the classic APRIORIgen process They are then assessed using strengthened support and conﬁdence deﬁned in Equations 4 and 5 The candidates for which one of these values is below the user-deﬁned thresholds are discarded These two steps are iterated until no more candidate can be generated During the initialisation phase the candidate strengthening itemsets containing single items are deﬁned as modalities of attributes that do not appear in the itemsets to strengthen Indeed rules involving several modalities of a given attributes with different status anteceden t conclusion reinforcement could only contain trivial information regarding mutual exclusion of modalities for instance and would not be of interest VI C ONCLUSION In this paper we proposed a new approach to strengthen fuzzy gradual rules reinforced using all the more clauses to extract more information summarizing data sets We studied the semantics of such rules proposed criteria to measure the relevance of such rules and described a candidate level-wise extraction algorithm Beside the application of this algorithm to several data sets in order to empirically evaluate the identiﬁed knowledge 


future works aim at extending the strengthening semantics to other types of fuzzy graduality in particular expressed by certainty rules More generally extensions to other types of rules such as association rules or non fuzzy gradual rules are to be examined They would provide a way to extract contextual information i.e rules that do not aply to the whole data but only to data subsets R EFERENCES  B  B ouchon-M e unier and S  D espr  es Acquisition num erique  symbolique de connaissances graduelles in 3 emes Journ ees Nationales du PRC Intelligence Artiﬁcielle Herm es 1990 pp 127–138  D  D ubois a nd H  P r ade Gr a dual i nfer ence r u les in appr o x im ate reasoning Information Sciences  vol 61 no 1-2 pp 103–122 1992  E  H  ullermeier Implication-based fuzzy association rules in Proc of PKDD’01  2001 pp 241–252  S  G alichet D  D ubois  and H  P r a de  I m pr ecis e s peci cation o f illknown functions using gradual rules Int Journal of Approximate Reasoning  vol 35 no 3 pp 205–222 2004  E  H  ullermeier Association rules for expressing gradual dependencies in Proc of PKDD’02  2002 pp 200–211  F  B er zal J  C C uber o  D  S anchez M  A  V ila and J  M  S er r a no An alternative approach to discover gradual dependencies Int Journal of Uncertainty Fuzziness and Knowledge-Based Systems  vol 15 no 5 pp 559–570 2007  L  D i J or io A  L aur e nt a nd M  T eis s eir e F as t e xtr acti on of gr adual association rules A heuristic based method in Proc of CSTST’08  2008   M ining f r e quent gr adual item s ets fr om lar ge databa s es   in Proc of IDA’09  2009  A  L aur e nt M  J L e sot and M  R ifqi  Gr aank E xploiting r a nk correlations for extracting gradual dependencies in Proc of FQAS’09  2009  P  L e nca B  V aillant P  M e yer  and S  L allich  A s s o ci ation r ule interestingness measures Experimental and theoretical studies in Quality Measures in Data Mining  F Guillet and H J Hamilton Eds Springer 2007 vol 43 pp 51–76  S  Br in R  M otw a ni a nd C S ilv er s tein  Be yond m a r k et bas k ets  Generalizing association rules to correlations in Proc of the ACM SIGMOD/PODS 97 Joint Conference  1997 pp 265–276

To resolve this problem, we proposed a new KDD model. It consists of two steps: the first organizes the database records in homogeneous clusters having common properties which permit to deduce the dataís semantic. This step consists of TAHís and MTAH generation of relieving attributes. The second permits to Discovering Knowledge. It consists to deduce the Fuzzy  Cluster Lattice corresponding to MTAH lattice generated in the first step, then traverse this lattice to extract the Meta Knowledge \( Set of fuzzy associations meta-rules on the clusters \, and in end deduce the rules modeling the Knowledge \(Set of fuzzy associations rules on the attributes\While basing on the hierarchical structure offered by the lattices, we proceed to discover the Knowledge in a hierarchical way. Thus, according to the degree of detail required by the user, this approach proposes a level of knowledge and different views of this knowledge Moreover, this solution is extensible; the user is able to choose the fuzzy method of classification according to the domain of his data and his needs This solution reduced considerably the number of generated rules, offered a better interpretation of the data and optimized both the space memory and the execution time As futures perspectives of this work, we mention 1\o test our approach on several the large data set, and 2\ to define a new intelligent method of evaluation of requests which takes into account the Meta knowledge and/or the knowledge base generated by our KDD model XI  R EFERENCES  1  P.
