Muhamad Adnan, Wahidah Husain, Faten Damanhoori School of Computer Sciences Universiti Sains Malaysia 11800 USM, Penang, Malaysia mhma.com08@student.usm.my, {wahidah, faten}@cs.usm.my   AbstractIn this paper we present data mining and its utilization for childhood obesity prediction. Data mining was widely used in many childhood obesity prediction systems. Predicting obesity at an early age is both useful and important because the number of obese patients is increasing while its main cause cannot yet be defined. The ability to predict childhood obesity will help early prevention. The purpose of this survey is to provide the needed understanding of the childhood obesity problem, introduce the use of data mining on childhood obesity prediction, describe current efforts in the area, and provide the strength and weaknesses of each technique presented Keywords-data mining; childhood obesity prediction I. INTRODUCTION Childhood obesity is a common issue nowadays. With advances in technology, people are becoming less concerned about living a healthy life. Not only adults, but the number of children that suffer from obesity is increasing every year. To determine whether a child is obese, Body Mass Index \(BMI was used. A child with BMI at or over the 97th percentile is considered obese [1].  If the children start to become obese at a very young age, their condition may become worse by the time they are adults. To help prevent childhood obesity, some effort has been made to predict obesity at early age. Some of the previous work on childhood obesity prediction used an artificial intelligence technique called data mining. This paper will introduce data mining utilization for childhood obesity prediction based on previous studies, provide comparisons in different data mining methods, and look for future direction in the area. In section 2, we define the concept of data mining and its technique which relate to childhood obesity prediction. In section 3, we describe how data mining was applied in 


childhood obesity prediction systems II. DATA MINING Data mining is the process of analyzing and summarizing data from different perspectives and converting it into useful information [2].  Data mining is a growing area of research that intersects with many disciplines such as AI, databases statistics, visualization, and high-performance and parallel computing. The goal of data mining is to turn data into knowledge. Data are facts, numbers, or text which can be processed by a computer [2].  In a large database, data mining is employed to detect patterns to extract hidden pieces of information [21 Data mining tasks can be classified as summarization classification, clustering, association and trend analysis [2 Summarization is the generalization or abstraction of a set of data resulting in a smaller set that gives a general overview of the data. Classification derives the class of an object based on its attributes. It will help for better understanding of the object class in databases. Clustering refers to identifying groups or clusters of objects with unknown classes. By looking at the objects common features, they can be summarized to form class descriptions [2]. Association is the discovery of togetherness or the connection of objects [14]. This connection of objects is termed the association rule  for example if an appearance of a set of objects in a database is strongly related to the appearance of another set of objects, the two sets are said to be associated. Trend analysis is finding the patterns and common attributes in data that change over time [2]. Many data mining techniques have been applied to childhood obesity prediction, including decision trees, association rules, Artificial Neural Network \(ANN Support Vector Machines \(SVMs    Among these methods, we chose to look at three: Artificial Neural Networks, Nave Bayes classifiers, and decision trees In our study we saw that these methods have more advantages in accuracy and efficiency and have recently become popular in many applications, especially in the medical field A.  Artificial Neural Networks The human brain has many advantages over modern parallel computers such as massive parallelism, learning ability, generalization ability, adaptiveness, fault tolerance, low energy consumption, distributed representation and distributed 


computation [3]. ANN is based on biological neural networks in the human brain.  A neuron \(Fig.1         Figure 1.  A sketch of a neuron inside human brain [3 information. It has several parts: the cell body, two types of branches \(axon and dendrites body. The axon works as a transmitter to transmit signals or impulses generated from the cell to other neurons while the dendrites receive incoming signals or impulses from other neuron. Each neuron is connected to many other neurons and neurons communicate through short trains of pulses. Important information is transmitted indirectly through interconnections ANN can be described as a connectionist model based on the human brain [3 ANN can be drawn as weighted directed graphs where the artificial neurons are nodes and directed edges show the connection between output neurons and input neurons, as shown in Fig. 2 [3]. ANN has been successfully used in many medical applications, such as predicting outcomes [15 diagnosis [16], and decision making systems [17] [18 B. Nave Bayes Classifiers A Bayesian network consists of a structural model and a set of conditional probabilities [4]. The structural model is a directed graph where nodes represent attributes and arcs represent attribute dependency. For classification problems Bayesian networks are used to construct classifiers from a given set of training examples with class labels. Assume that A1, A2,,An are n attributes \(refer to nodes in Bayesian network an,>, where a1, is the value of A1. Let C represent the class variable \(refer to class node in a Bayesian network represent the value that C takes and c\(E    


        Figure 2.  A neural network model [3 The classifier of a general Bayesian network is defined in \(1  1  By assuming that all attributes are independent, the result is a classifier called Nave Bayes as defined in \(2   2  Fig. 3 shows graphically the structure of Naive Bayes Nave Bayes has been used in many medical applications such as skin disease detection and biometric recognition [5] [6 C. Decision Tree Decision trees are powerful classification algorithms that are popular in information systems [8]. Widely used decision tree algorithms include Iterative Dichotomiser 3 \(ID3 assistant algorithm, C4.5, C5, and CART [7][8].  Decision tree techniques perform separate observation in branches recursively to construct a tree for prediction. Splitting algorithms  i.e. information gain \(used in ID3, C4.5, C5 index \(used in CART used in CHAID are used to identify a variable and its corresponding threshold and split the input observation into two or more subgroups Then the steps are repeated until a complete tree is built. The reason for the splitting algorithm is to find the variablethreshold pair\(s  Fig.4 shows graphically a decision tree structure      


 Figure 3.  An example of nave Bayes structure [4   Figure 4.  A structure of a decision tree  Decision trees have been used for many medical purposes such as predicting the outcome of coronary heart diseases and in medical diagnosis systems [8][19 III. APPLICATION OF DATA MINING FOR CHILDHOOD OBESITY PREDICTION Obesity can be defined as an excessive accumulation of body fat [11]. Prediction means an indication in advance based on observation, experience, or scientific reason [20].  A childhood obesity prediction system, therefore, is a system to identify young children who are at risk of excessive body fat obesity data mining, childhood obesity predictions are possible 9][10][11]. We present three data mining techniques that have been used for childhood obesity prediction systems A. Artificial Neural Networks For the ANN childhood obesity prediction system, massive amounts of data were collected from health care service organizations. In the first stage, data about pregnancy course morphological changes of the mother, and her psychological attitude were collected and observed. In the second stage observations of newborns took place in maternity hospital In the third stage, children from 1 to 12 months of age were monitored along with their nutrition and vaccinations Observation was repeated when they were 3 years old and again when they were at the entrance of grammar school, with periodic health examinations by specialists. The parents also took part in questionnaires about their health and their economic and social status [9 The reason for such observation is to identify risk factors of childhood obesity and childrens tendency towards obesity The first risk factor is the family itself: history of obesity in the family, parental disease, the mother`s weight during pregnancy family nutrition style, education and level of physical activity The second factor is lifestyle: good and bad habits, handling in early years of life, nutrition, physical activities, illness and the personal character of the child. The third factor is the social 


environment: family size, income and status. These risk factors are used as the inputs in the ANN childhood obesity prediction system [9 The system was developed using a new generation of radial basis artificial neural network \(RBANN the weaknesses of ANN which consume time and are less optimum [9]. Fig. 5 shows a graphic of radial basis function network        Figure 5.  A radial basis function network [9 The formula for the technique is as follows [9 given m different points in                                    ?n   n  and m real numbers                            a function is calculated from     n to      that satisfies the interpolation condition 3 function s can be obtained from m-dimensional linear space An interpolation method in which s has the form  4 was selected for RBANN where mr is the number of radial basis functions and the      are the weights. In Fig. 5, weights w1 to w3 refer to     in \(4 O is a sum of linear combination of values output from the radial basis layer V- \(4 equation is performed  5 The    `s value is calculated using linear least squares solution \(LLSS of patterns, ill conditioned matrices can arise in \(4 perfect solution. Storage problem also arise with the usage of LLSS [9].  Fast convergence and a way to avoid under fitting and over fitting is needed to overcome this problem by using a minimum number of neurons. One possible solution is to use one neuron in the hidden layer and add one neuron for each iteration until the convergence criteria is not satisfied [9]. One 


of the simplest forms of RBANN is to set the number of neurons equal to the number of patterns that exist in the input The simple RBANN form leads to a direct solution called the zero error solution [9 B. Naive Bayes Classifiers In this system, data were collected from children during the first 2 years of life. Using nave Bayes, the collected data were employed to predict whether the children belonged to the lean or obese class. Several attributes were chosen for the training process: gender, adjusted Standard Deviation Scores \(SDS birth weight; adjusted SDS weight gain from birth to 6 weeks adjusted SDS weight gain between 6 weeks and 8 month adjusted SDS length at 6 weeks, adjusted SDS height at 2 years, length of gestation, adjusted SDS BMI at 2 years, BMI at 8 months, and whether the child was obese or lean at 3 years old [10 To evaluate the prediction success rate, four parameters were studied: sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value. The most important parameter is the sensitivity value, which refers to the number of correctly predicted obese cases compared to total obese cases. A higher sensitivity value means that the prediction is more accurate. To evaluate nave Bayes prediction success rates, tests were done when the children were 6 weeks, 8 month, and 2 years old 10 This is how the technique is implemented. Let X be the children whose class is to be determined \(obese or non-obese       Let H be the hypothesis, that child X belongs to obese class C For classification, we want to determine P\(H|X probability that the hypothesis H holds given the observed data X. The formula to calculate P\(H|X as follows  6 where P\(H X|H probability of child X conditioned on H, and P\(X 


probability of X. To determine P\(H|X determine P\(X|H H X from the data used for training [10]. For nave Bayes classifier, the steps to predict child obesity probability for data sample X is as follows First, calculate the posterior probability conditioned on X. Sample X will be assigned to class Ci if and only if \(7 7 P \(Ci|X 8  P\(X P\(X|Ci Ci then all classes are assumed as equally likely. Therefore P\(X|Ci P\(X|Ci Ci Ci 9 where NU1 is the number of training samples that belong to class Ci, and  NU is the total number of training samples [10 Then, assume that all the attributes are independent of each other \(no dependence relation among them applied 10 P\(x1|Ci x2|Ci xn|Ci training samples. If Ak is categorical, then  11 where NUik is the number of training samples of class Ci for nominal value xk for Ak, and NUi is the number of training samples belonging to Ci Next \(8 9 10 7 sample X to the class Ci with the highest probility P\(X|Ci Ci prediction when the attributes are independent and when applied to a large database [10 C. Decision Tree One system that uses the decision tree technique is a weight management counseling system for obese children. The system contains two modules, a Knowledge Management Module and Case Based Reasoning Module, as shown in Fig. 6. The Knowledge Management Module has three components: a data 


repository, a knowledge miner and a case based rule structure In the knowledge miner component, the decision tree technique is used to build trees from a database of cases. The decision tree technique is also used in the Case Based Reasoning Module to find possible solutions to a new child case [11 A decision tree starts with root attributes and ends with leaf nodes. Usually it has several branches which represent classes Below, we show an example of decision tree algorithm that was used for childhood obesity prediction [10 The tree is generated based on information-gain measure The steps are as follows.  Calculate  12  13  where pi is the probability that an arbitrary sample belongs to class C                   Figure 6.  Child weight management counseling system architecture [11      


Then, calculate the entropy E\(Ai based on partitioning by attribute Ai  as follows  14   15  where Pij = sij / | Sj |, and | Sj | is the number of samples in subset Sj. Then by branching on Ai, the encoding information that would be gained is  16 For the root node, the attribute Ai with the highest information gain is selected. Then the branches are built based on different values of aij, j = 1,,q. The tree will grow until all the samples are in same class, at which point the node becomes a leaf and is labeled with that class [10]. Fig.7 shows a graphical example of a decision tree for an obesity problem. S1, S2, and S3 in Fig. 7 refer to the solutions of the obesity problem IV. DISCUSSION In this section, we discuss the effectiveness, efficacy, strengths and weaknesses of the three data mining techniques. We also include the challenge within the problem and its applicability to other adult diseases. Table 1 summarizes the strengths and weaknesses of each technique discussed ANN, nave Bayes classifier, and decision tree are data mining techniques that are applicable for childhood obesity prediction. For ANN, environment is considered as an important factor for childhood obesity prediction. The prediction result can be more promising because environment undeniably plays major role in a childs growth. The nave Bayes classifier focuses more on the childs personal attributes rather than the environment. However, the result of nave Bayes classifier has been proven acceptable for childhood obesity prediction [10

Can be computationally expensive to train  For the decision tree, we see that the technique is easier to build than the other two methods since various attributes can be used for childhood obesity prediction In the future, we will work on hybridizing two or more applicable data mining methods. We hope that the results will be better than current methods available.  Our goal is to increase the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of predictions, and reduce the cost \(time and space methods. We will also increase our efforts to find better solutions to childhood obesity                 Figure 7. A decision tree for an obesity problem [11 The main challenge within this problem is to successfully predict obesity at an early age. As we know, it is difficult to identify potentially obese children when they are still young Their parent\(s become obese when they grow up. Many factors are related to obesity, including environment, family, lifestyle and habits Obesity may lead to many co-morbidity disorders such as type 


2 diabetes, cardiovascular, early puberty, suicide, smoking bulimia, poor self image, social isolation and hypertension [1 If obesity prediction is successful, then early prevention steps can be taken The data mining techniques outlined above have also been used to predict other adult diseases such as diabetes and heart diseases [12][13]. The similarities with childhood obesity prediction are the way data was collected and the risk factors, while the differences are the input and output of the prediction and how the techniques were implemented for that purpose V. CONCLUSION This survey has shown that data mining can be used to successfully predict childhood obesity. The three methods presented  ANN, nave Bayes, and decision tree  are proven applicable to childhood obesity prediction.  These methods each have their weaknesses and strengths; thus, further improvements of the techniques are necessary to fully resolve the childhood obesity prediction problem. This survey also reminds the reader about co-morbidity of childhood obesity and why it is important to prevent it at early age ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to thank the Universiti Sains Malaysia \(USM REFERENCES  1] A.
