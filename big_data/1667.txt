INTRODUCTION  \nOnline social networks such as Facebook, Twitter and Sina \nWeibo have become more and more popular in recent years nwhich play an important role in our daily life. Twitter is a \nglobal online social networking service and microblogging \nservice. The platform rapidly gained worldwide popularity and \nbecome the most popular microblogging sites on the internet \nwith more than 500 million users. According to the “2012 Blue \nBook of China microblog” released by DCCI Internet Data \nCenter, the users of Sina Weibo have reached 327 million nCompared with traditional social network service \(SNS platform, which \nforms the social networks with complex structure and close \nconnection. The relationships of Weibo microblogging is the \nfoundation of Weibo social networks, which affects the \nformation and development of microblogging social networks \ngreatly, and therefore, research of analyzing the Weibo users nrelationships is of important theoretical value and practical \nsignificance.  \nLink prediction aims at estimating the likelihood of the \nexistence of links between nodes, which is usually based on the \nnetwork structure and node attribute information [1]. Online \nSNS has large number of users and complex relationships nbetween users, which creates large-scale social networks. \nNodes in the network represent the users, and edges represent \nthe relationships between users. Link prediction problem \nanalyzes the possible relationships in the future. Liben-Nowell \nand Kleinberg first proposed a link prediction model for social \nnetworks [2 the model predicts the possibility of the existence \nof link by calculating the topological structure similarity of \ngraph vertices, and simultaneously analyze the attribute \ninformation of the topological structure of social networks. \nCurrently, the link prediction model for social networks has \nmainly developed into three categories: \n\(1 Networks, SVM, KNN and the \nensemble classifiers like Bagging, Boosting and Random \nForest et al. Much of the research on link prediction problems \nin the traditional field of social networks has been conducted \nfrom these perspectives. Hasan et al [3] compared different \nclasses of supervised learning algorithms in terms of their \nprediction performance on the DBLP dataset, and the ranking \nof features with popular features ranking algorithms shows that \na small subset of features always plays a significant role in the \nlink prediction job Michael et al [4] present a solution to the \nlink prediction problem based on a machine learning classifier ntrained on a small set of easy-to-compute topological features. \nA new topological feature, friend-measure was developed and \nshown to be a good predictor for missing links. The classifiers \nare evaluated using five large social network datasets i.e. \nFacebook [5], Flickr [6], Youtube [7], Academia [8] and the \nMarker [9 n\(2 likelihood \nof a link in the social network graph can be seen as an \noptimization problem based on the probabilistic model. \nBayesian Networks [10] and Markov networking model [11] \nare two common kinds of probabilistic models. Hopcroft and \nJie Tang et al [12] proposed a Triad Factor Graph\(TriFG based on the Factor Graph model for the novel \nproblem of two-way relationship prediction in social networks nThe TriFG model was evaluated on a large Twitter network \ndataset and significantly improved the performance comparing \nwith several alternative methods. \n\(3 nbetween nodes using similarity matrix that reduced order. \nKunegis et al [13] approached the link prediction problem to a \nlinear algebra problem based on the graph’s adjacency matrix, \nthen the problem was transformed to be a minimization \n2013 International Conference on Cloud Computing and Big Data\n978-1-4799-2829-3/13 26.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/CLOUDCOM-ASIA.2013.43\n50230 9 4 31 4\nproblem that can be reduced to a 


one-dimensional least-squares \nregression problem. \nLink prediction problem has become one of the most nimportant research directions of social networks, and \ncontributes to the committee evolution and the formation of \nrelationships among users. Most of the research on social \nnetworks of Sina Weibo focus on the social networks \ntopological structure [14] and the content based mining [15]. \nHowever, there are fewer researches on features that affect the \nformation of relationship among users. This paper uses the \nsupervised learning method, social networks topological \nstructure features and the attribute information of Weibo nmicroblogging. Through analyzing the topological features, \nsuch as degree, common friends neighborhood-subgraphs and \nfriends-measure et al, and the attribute information of Weibo \nusers like following number, fans number, message number \nand address score, we propose the prediction model based on nBayesian network and evaluate it with Sina Weibo dataset, the \nmodel achieves a good performance, and the result verifies the \nsignificant importance of topological features and Weibo’s \nattribute features on social networks. \nThe contributions of our research are listed in the \nfollowing: \n \(1 between Weibo users using \nthe link prediction method; \n \(2 traditional \ntopological features of Weibo network, combine the two types \nof features improve the predictive performance; \n \(3 relationships in \nWeibo social network and verify the significant importance of \nboth the topological features and Weibo’s attribute features on \nWeibo social network.  \nII. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION \nThe Weibo social networks topological structure can be \nmodeled as a graph. Vertices in the graph represent users while \nedges represent the relationship between users. Compared with \nthe network structure of Facebook and Renren, the Weibo \nsocial networks topological structure is a directed graph. Let \n topological structure \nof Weibo social network. Where V is the node set and E is the \nlink set \(edge set Assuming two vertices ,u v V? , while \n nindicates that user u follows user v. The link prediction is the \nproblem of predicting the possible existence of relationships \nbetween users. This paper constructs the model based on the \nsupervised learning classifier for the link prediction problem. \nThe classification model is trained on the selected training set nLet a pair of vertices ,u v V? and      classification model for the link prediction \nproblem is a binary classification model. Our sample set is a ncollection of vertices pairs from the directed graph constructed \nby the Weibo dataset, of which the labeled 1  Both the training dataset and testing dataset are \nbuilt from the sample set. We train the binary classification \nmodel on training dataset and verify it on the testing dataset. \nUsing the model built we can predict the existence of edge \nbetween two vertices the two users. \nIII. FEATURE EXTRACTION \nFor the classification model, the feature set is significantly nimportant. This section describes the features that used in our \nmodel. According to the different source of features, we extract \ntwo types of features – topological features and attribute \nfeatures. The topological features are extracted from the \ntopological structure of the directed graph formed by the \nWeibo social network. We expand the common friends feature, \ntotal friends feature, Adamic-Adar feature according to the nfeatures proposed by [1][4]and the characteristic of Weibo \nsocial network. Since the high computing complexity of \ntopological features and consider that Weibo has rich attribute \ninformation which may have influence on users’ relationships. \nOnly the topological features does not adequately reflect the nrelationships between Weibo users, so we introduce the \nattribute features and study the formation of relationships using \nthe attribute features like fans number, follow number, address \nscore and message number. The topological features and \nattribute features used in our model are described below. \nA Topological Features \nDefinition 1 Vertex Degree Features: In social network \ntopological structure, the vertex features is an important \nmeasurement index. In directed graph vertices that are adjacent to v form a set of v’s friends, \nwhich is defined as a neighborhood of  v fThe set of \nfriends that follow v is different from the set of friends that v \nfollow. Therefore we define the incoming set    n{ }\n          v u E\nv v v\n? = ?     ?\n? = ?\n? = ?\n? = ? ? ?\n?2? \nAccording to the different set of v’s neighborhoods that are \ndefined above, we can also define the count of vertices of each \nset as the vertex degree of v: \n          


3? \n503\nDefinition 2 Common Friends Features: The common \nfriends features is also called common neighborhood CN  ncommon_friends         bi\nout\nbi\nu v u v\nu v u v\nu v u v\n= ? ? ?\n= ? ? ?\n= ? ? ?\n?4? \nDefinition 3 Total Friends Features: The total friends \nfeatures of u and v are the distinct friends that both u and v \nhave together. For the directed graph, we can also define three \ntotal friends features like common friends features as follows ntotal_friends     n   in inu v u v\nu v u v\nu v u v\n= ? ? ?\n= ? ? ?\n= ? ? ?\n?5? \nDefinition 4 Transitive Friends Features: In social nnetwork analysis \(SNA social networks. It \nreflects the ability of controlling the connection on the path \nbetween users. There are more transitive friends on the path  \nfrom u to v, the higher probability that v will follows u.  The ntransitive friends is defined as: \ntransitive_friends   Preferential Attachment Score: There is an \ninteresting phonomena in social networks that the users who  \nhave more friends are more likely be friends. The likelihood of \nforming relationships between elites is higher than ordinary \nusers, namely, the rich get richer. The preferential attachment \nsocre that proposed is for the purpose of measuring the \nphonomena. In the graph, it is expected that the higher the \npreferential attachment score,  the higher the chances that both \nvertices u and v will be connected. The preferential attachment nscore is defined as follow: \npreferential_attachment_score   Adamic-Adar Features: consider the \ncommon neighborhoods of u and v, the adamic-addr \(AA  measure, which shows that neighbors who \nhave low degree have bigger contribution than neighbors who \nhave higher degree. Thus we give a weight of the vertex, d\(z 1/lg d\(z that we used are defined as \nfollows: \n        in\nz u v\nz u v\nu v\nlgd z\nu v\nlgd z\n?? ??\n?? ??\n=\n=\n\n\n ?8? \nDefinition 7 Friends-measure Features: When looking at \ntwo vertices in a social network, assuming that the more \nconnections their neighborhoods have with each other, the \nhigher the chances the two vertices are connected. Michael et \nal proposed the Friends-measure [4] based on the Katz \nmeasure [17]. The Friends-measure is defined as the number \nof connections between the neighborhoods  of u and v:  \n    n=\n  ?9? \nwhere \(x, y    of the Katz-measure where  =1 and \nlmax =2. \nDefinition 8 Opposite Direction Friends: In the social nnetworks, when u follows v, usually v will follow back u. For \na directed graph G, opposite direction friends is a specic \nmeasure that indicates if reciprocal connections exists between \nthe nodes: \n{1   Features: The \nneighborhodd subgraph is formed by the common \nneighborhoods of u and v. In neighborhood subgraph, the \nmore connections between users, the stronger relationships \nbetween them. The following features that denote the number \nof edges within the neighbor-subgraphs for vertex u and v: \n{ }\n nsubgraph_edge_count        v\nu v x y Ex y u v u v\n       =  ?  ? ?  ? ?\n=  ?  ? ?  ? ?  ? \n?12? \nB. Weibo’s Attribute Features \nThe topological features influence on the formation of \nrelationships between users from the perspective view of the \ntopological structure of social networks. Weibo Social network \nconsists of rich attribute information which also has a \nsignificant influence on the relationships between users. The \nattribute features of the Weibo users include user-id, username, \nsex, description, address, attention number, fans number, \nmessage number et al. In this research, we use the Cnpameng  \ndataset [18] that crawled from Sina Weibo microblogging site. \nLet u be a Weibo user, we define his or her attention number, \nfans number, message number as     graph formed by the sample dataset, u is the \nstarting point and v is the endpoint, we can obtain attribute ninformation of each vertex from the dataset and draw the \ndistribution graph for each attribute feature for positive sample \ndataset and negative sample dataset. Due to the space limitation \nof the paper, we can’t present all the distribution graph of all \nattribute features. For each category of attribute features, we nchoose one attribute feature and draw its distribution graph.  \nFollowing are the categories of Weibo attribute features: \n504\nDefinition 1 Attention Number Features: The attention \nnumber reflects the active level of Weibo user. Relatively, the \nactive users have higher chance of forming relationships with \neach other. When looking at the starting points of attention \nnumber in the positive sample dataset and negative 


dataset that \npresented in Fig. 1, it can be seen that the attention number is \nconcentrated in a range from 0 to 500 and achieves the highest \non 2000 because of 2000 is the maximum attention number \nSina limit.  We also can see that the attention number of \nnegative sample dataset is concentrated in less than 100 while \nthe distribution of the attention number of positive sample \ndataset is relatively flat. For the pair of vertices  product of the two features. \nThey are defined as follows: \n  u\nattention num d attention num v\nattention num bi attention num s attention num d\n_ _ = _\n_ _ = _\n_ _ = _ _ _ _\n?13? \n \nFig. 1. The attention number distribution of starting point \nDefinition 2 Fans Number Features: On the one hand, the \nfans number features present the active level of Weibo user, at \nthe same time it reflects its influence and popularity. Obviously, \nthe greater number of fans, the higher the influence and \npopularity are. Fig. 2 illustrates the distribution of the fans \nnumber of endpoint; it seems that distribution of this feature is \nrelatively concentrated in positive sample dataset while it is \nrelatively flat in negative sample dataset. It can be seen that \nusers with few fans, the possibility of existence relationships \nbetween them is relatively lower.  For a pair of vertices starting \npoint, endpoint and the product of the two features. They are \ndefined as follows: \n  num s fans num u\nfans num d fans num v\nfans num bi fans num s fans num d\n_ _ = _\n_ _ = _\n_ _ = _ _ _ _\n \(14 nFig. 2. The fans number distribution of endpoint \nDefinition 3 Message Number Features: To some extent, \nthe message number also reflects the active level of Weibo user. \nThe possibility of forming relationships between active users is \nrelatively high. It can be seen in Fig. 3 that the distribution of \nthis feature tends to be flat in both positive and negative sample \ndataset. For a pair of vertices nfeatures include message number of the starting point, endpoint \nare defined as follows: \n  num s message num u\nmessage num d message num v\n_ _ = _\n_ _ = _\n    ?15? \n \nFig. 3. The message number distribution of endpoint \nDefinition 4 Address Score Features: Except the attention \nnumber, fans number and message number, the address \ninformation of Weibo user also has an influence on the \nformation of relationships between users. In this paper, we just \ntake the location of user’s Weibo account as the only address \ninformation into consideration. The location of Weibo user’s \naccount contains of two levels, the provincial level \(L1 L2 the city level is “Fzuhou”. Let \( ,1 2 define the \naddress score as the measure of the address information: \n2 \( ,1 1 2 2  1 1 n\n\n   \n\n\(16 sample dataset shows that the address \nscore of most of the pair of vertices is 0 while in the positive nsample dataset, the proportion of the pairs whose score equals \n505\n1 or 2 is much higher than that in negative sample dataset. As \ncan be seen, the location information of users has a certain \nimpact of the formation of relationships between users. \n \nFig. 4. Statistical results of address score \nIV. BAYESIAN NETWORKS \nThe classifier model used in our experiment is based on the \nBayesian Network [19], which is a probabilistic graphical \nmodel that represents as conditional dependencies via a \ndirected acyclic graph \(DAG based on the conditional \nprobability tables \(CPTs Compared with most of other classifiers, \nhowever, it is a more reliable technique under conditions of nuncertainty that considers the correlation among features. The \nBayesian Network is based on the Bayesian theory, for a given \na random sample D, it is defined as: \n      DS\nP S D\nP D P D\n = =  ?17? \nWhere hS is the topological structure of Bayesian Network that \ndenotes the causal relationships among variables and prediction \nmodels, the input variables for the classifier only includes the \ntopological structure features though the analysis of Weibo’s \nattribute information shows that the Weibo’s attribute features \nalso plays a significant impact on classification, so the attribute \nfeatures was added as the input variables to improve the \nperformance of prediction. \nFor the topological structure of social networks, the \nmagnitude of computing possible edges is the square of \nvertices, but the number of actual existence of edges is far less \nthan that so there exist the problem of data skew. In this case, \nuneven distribution of samples can’t reflect the distribution of \nthe whole sample space, therewith exist the problem of skew \nclassification distribution. For the binary classification model \nof our experiment, in reality, the Weibo social network is huge, \nwith a really large number of nodes and relationships which \nusually reach millions or more. The magnitude of possible \nlinks between nodes equals the square of the number of nodes, \nwhile the percentage of actual links is relatively small, thereby \nresulting in uneven distribution of positive and negative sample. \nThe positive 


samples \(majority class problem \nbecome more apparent [20]. Resampling is one of the main \nmethods of handling the data skew problem by reducing the \nuneven degree of data samples to balance the distribution of the \nproportion of the positive and negative samples to improve the \nclassification performance of the minority class. Resampling \nmethods includes oversampling and undersampling method. \nOversampling generates additional minority class instances to neven the class distribution while undersampling selects a \nsample of majority class instances such that the number of \nmajority class tokens is reduced to the number of minority \nclass tokens. In our experiment considering the computational \ncomplexity of features, we adopt sampling with replacement \nwhen resampling of existence and non-existence links. Making \nthe proportion of positive and negative samples selected \nbalanced 1:1 adopted to \nverify the performance of the algorithm, and the AUC \(area \nunder the roc curve an important indicator to \nmeasure the efficiency of classification. The AUC value can be \ninterpreted as the probability that a randomly chosen missing \nlink is given a higher score than a randomly chosen nonexistent nlink. In the algorithm implementation, at each time we \nrandomly pick a missing link and a nonexistent link to compare \ntheir scores, if among n independent comparisons, there are \nn? times the missing link having a higher score and n?? times \nthey have the same score, the AUC value is \n0.5n nAUC\nn\n? ??+\n=           ?18? \nB Experimental Design \nThe general procedure of the experiment is presented as \nfollows: \nStep 1. Generate the edge set of the Weibo social network. \n Step 2. Extract the positive and negative samples according \nto the size of the edge set. In this paper, the size of positive \nsample and negative sample are 25000, i.e. we randomly \nextract 25000 existence edges and 25000 nonexistence edges.  \n Step 3. Use the 10-flods cross-validation to train and test \nthe classifier on samples and generate 10 groups of training \nsets and testing sets. Each group includes one training set and \none testing set. \n Step 4. Calculate features for each group of training set and \ntesting set. Train the classifier on training set, verify it on the \ntesting set and then calculate the AUC value of each group. \n Step 5. Calculate the average AUC value of 10 groups of ntraining sets and testing sets. \nC. Datasets \nThe user relationship dataset of Sina Weibo from \nCnpameng 18], Academia dataset [8], Flickr dataset [6] and \nYouTube dataset [5] are adopted to conduct the experiments. \nAs for the Sina Weibo dataset, Cnpameng is a cooperation \n506\ngroup of crawling data on Sina Weibo in crowdsourcing way. \nMembers of Cnpameng contribute datasets their crawled to the \nplatform for more data. The Weibo dataset used in this paper \ncombines the datasets of users and relationships that were ncrawled on AU 8 June 2012. We filter the Weibo dataset \nthrough removing the repeated and incorrect instances, and \nthen generate the topological structure of Weibo social network \nthrough the following relationships of Weibo users. Another \nthree datasets are from website like the Sina Weibo. \nThe statistical parameter is listed in Table I. \nTABLE I.

Feature Set \n As for Academia dataset, Flickr dataset and YouTube \ndataset, the topological features are used to perform the \nclassification experiments. Specially, as for the Weibo dataset, \nthe attribute features are adopted in addition to the topological \nfeatures. As section III described, there are 22 topological \nfutures in the topological feature set and 9 attribute features in \nthe attribute feature set. \nE. Experiment Results \nFig. 5 illustrates the AUC results of each dataset. Results \nshow that the AUC values of Academia, Fliclkr and Youtube \nare basically identical with that in [4]. Where the pm0608_1 \nand pm0608_2 are the Sina Weibo datasets, in order to make a \ncomparison, the pm0608_1 adopts the topological structure \nfeature set while the pm0608_2 adopts both the topological nstructure feature set and the Weibo attribute feature set. \nIt can be seen that the predictive performance achieves \nquite good when only the topological structure feature set is \nadopted.  Furthermore, when we combine the Weibo attribute \nfeature set and the topological structure feature set, the AUC \nscore is improved from 0.96318 to 0.97967. We get a better \nresult when we use all the features together. \nCompared with other three traditional classifier models for \npm0608_2 dataset in Fig. 6 and Table II, Naïve Bayesian \(NB and SVM, Fig. 6 shows that the Bayesian Network \(BN nTable II, we also list precision, recall, and F-measure for the \nmodels.

CONCLUSION \nIn this paper, we analyze the factors that affect the \nrelationships between Weibo users using link prediction \nmethod, the topological structure features and Weibo attribute nfeatures are adopted together to generate the link prediction \nmodel based on Bayesian network. The contributions of this \npaper are as follows: firstly, we use the traditional link \nprediction method that adopt topological structure and achieve \nquite good performance, which verifies the result that the ntopological structure features have significant influence on the \nformation of relationships between users Then we introduce \nthe Weibo attribute features and compare the performance \nusing topological structure features only and the performance \nusing the Weibo attribute features and topological structure \nfeatures together; We find that the Weibo attribute features \nadded help to improve the performance of link prediction for \nWeibo social network. Through analyzing the features of \nWeibo social network that affect the relationships between \nusers, we can also gain an insight into the behavior of Weibo \nusers and the information dissemination mechanism. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThis paper is supported by the National Natural Science nFoundation of China under Grant No. 61103175, the Natural \nScience Foundation of Fujian Province under Grant No. \n2013J01232, the Key Project Development Foundation of \nEducation Committee of Fujian Province under Grant No. \nJK2012003 and the Technology Innovation Platform Project of \nFujian Province under Grant No. 2009J1007 nREFERENCES \n[1] Lin-yuan Lv, “Link prediction on complex networks,” J.

Existing clinical functional elec-\ntrical stimulation systems use the patient’s residual movement to activate muscles and \nrestore simple grasp. We have developed a BMI to control muscle activation, allowing \n monkey subjects to pick up and move objects despite complete paralysis of the flexor muscles below the el-\nbow. Such a system could restore voluntary movements to SCI patients through normal cognitive processes.  \nHowever, a critical remaining issue is the need to restore proprioception, the loss of which largely eliminates \nthe ability to plan movement dynamics. Neurons in the somatosensory cortex signal limb movement with dis-\ncharge that is broadly tuned to a “preferred direction 


By stimulating small groups of electrodes with similar \npreferred directions, we can induce perceptions of limb motion similar to those caused by actual limb move-\nment. We are developing a neuroprosthesis that would restore a sense of limb state to SCI patients. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Lee E.

Hunter Peckham \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE Neuroprostheses for Movement Restoration \n \nAbstract: Major advances have been made over the past decade in use of neuropros-\ntheses for restoration of motor function.  These advances have been built on the fun-\ndamental science of neural excitation and the technologies for implantable stimulation \nand control. The technologies have advanced to provide operational systems that func-\ntion in the human body for decades, and include implantable electrodes, stimulation \ndevices, and sensors.  The neural interface between the excitable tissue and the delivery electrode are ena-\nbling evermore powerful control and precision in the delivery of stimulation, not only providing for excita-\ntion but also blocking of neural activity \(e.g. for annihilation of pain or spasticity interfaces are currently in development \nthat will provide greater flexibility in implementation and performance. \n \nThe clinical manifestations of these findings are the available systems that have been created, and are being \ndeveloped, to restore function.  These include many areas of the body for people with spinal cord injury, \nincluding hand grasp, standing and walking, breathing, and bladder and bowel control Several patients \nhave benefited from systems that enable more than one function \(e.g. hand function and bladder control restore full \narm mobility and levels of standing and ambulation.  Several areas where future advances are likely to meet \nclinical challenges will be discussed.   \n \nBiographical Sketch: P. Hunter Peckham is currently at the Institute for Functional Restoration, or IFR, at \nCase Western Reserve University \(CWRU deploys neuroprosthetic interventions into clinical use to re-\nstore the functions lost due to spinal cord injury or other paralytic conditions.

Some are acted upon immedi-\nately, but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions -- our implicit "label-\ning" of the world. In this talk I will describe our work using physiological correlates of this labeling to con-\nstruct a hybrid brain-computer interface \(hBCI record electroencephalographic \(EEG part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate \nthe neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective inter-\nest. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using nsemi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to those that are labelled. \nFinally, the system plots an efficient route so that subjects visit similar objects of interest. We show that by \nexploiting the subjects' implicit labeling, the median search precision is increased from 25% to 97%, and the \nmedian subject need only travel 40% of the distance to see 84% of the objects of interest. We also find that \nthe neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers inference of subjects' \nimplicit labeling. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of ob-\njects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting \nin an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user's interests. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Paul Sajda is Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Radiol-\nogy at Columbia University and Director of the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing \n\(LIINC modeling and \nmachine learning applied to image understanding.

White \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Are Our Cellular Models Fundamentally Wrong? \n \nAbstract: The Hodgkin-Huxley model, arguably the greatest success story in the history \nof computational neuroscience, is the predecessor of thousands of existing cellular models \nthat span a significant range of levels of detail. Here, using electrophysiological, dynamic-\nclamp, and computational techniques, we demonstrate that many of the “gold standard” \nsingle-cell models, used by thousands of laboratories, fail to account correctly for the responses of well-studied \nexcitatory neurons to noise.  In particular, the input-output gain of entorhinal stellate cells and neocortical py-\nramidal cells is substantially less sensitive to noise than predicted by the models.  The major source of the dis-\ncrepancy is that the models fit measured peri-threshold voltage dynamics poorly.  Because noise is ubiquitous \nand prominent in the brain, and because neuronal gain is crucial for understanding a wide range of response nproperties at the cellular and network levels, we argue that this is an issue of fundamental importance. \n nBiographical Sketch:  John A.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
