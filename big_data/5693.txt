Distributed File Management System Based on SSH2 and HDFS 
As time goes on, the current running information system produces massive data. Obviously the previous hardware could not fit for managing the much bigger data any more. In order to upgrade the system there are three main problems need to consider: enough storage space, high reliability, high performance and relatively low cost. As an open-source J2EE framework SSH2 is widely used by developers to develop all kinds of management information systems. Hadoop, another opensource project running in an integrated cluster, is good at

I NTRODUCTION  With the rapid development of information technology, the scale of the accumulated data is becoming huger. Age of Big Data, as a new buzzword word, is coming. It is a great challenge to deal with the big data that we have to consider at least four main problems 1.High Storage Space: There is enough storage space to store the big data. Even it could grow with the scale of the data 2.High Reliability: The stored data should be safe 3.High Performance: Much more computing power 
is required to process the big data 4.Economic: Expense is always very important Though some high-performance mainframes can be qualified for the task, the high cost is difficult to be accepted by most enterprises or institutions. Clearly what we need is to process the big data effectively but with relatively low cost   The research on the storage system based on the distributed network has become a hot topic. Now, there are many kinds of distributed network storage system such as OceanStore, CFS, PAST, Tangler, Pangaea Granary and so on [1 Gen e r a lly dis t ri bu te d f i l e s y s t em  is multi-user, and to a certain degree it is hard to manage This paper will introduce how to design and develop a distributed file management information 
system to provide a easy way to manage the distributed files. On the other hand, this paper shows a way to change a single computer system into a distributed one quickly The reminder of this paper is arranged as follows The core technology is introduced in Section 2. In Section 3, we describe the details of system construction and conclude the paper in Section 4 II 
C ORE T ECHNOLOGY  HDFS[2  H adoo p D i strib u t e d Fil e Sy ste m  i s a subproject of Hadoop. It is a distributed file system running on commodity hardware \(cheap, easy to get HDFS lives in a cluster containing many nodes and integrates all nodesê storage resources. So that it has 
 
A HDFS 
 
large storage capacity. Generally, in a huge cluster, the rate of node failure is very high. It is thus clear that HDFS must have high tolerance of faults C o m p a r ed with the traditional way of file storage, HDFSês outstanding character lies in that it can save and back up a file on several nodes by splitting it into blocks [7  
 
Figure 1 Hadoop Distribution File System Model HDFS uses the master-slave structure as in Figure1 There are two kinds of nodes in a HDFS cluster NameNode and DataNode. NameNode is responsible for the management and maintenance of the clusterês internal file directory information such as the information of the location of the file blocks. DataNode which is managed by the NameNode is responsible for the storage of the file blocks, and sends back information list of the stored file blocks regularly. But

HDFS has its disadvantage. Hadoop is more suitable for big data set consisted by large files instead of the small files The client gets the file from the cluster as following: First it should send a request to the NameNode, and then the NameNode will return an address list of the file blocks which belong to the required file. Finally the client reads the file blocks from the çnearesté \(Ordered by transmission time DataNodes. Similarily, when the client wants to write a file into the cluster. First it needs to send a request to the NameNode, then the NameNode will check userês authority and the existence of the file. And then the NameNode will add a new record for the file. Finally client can write file blocks into the appointed DataNodes SSH2[6-7 a f r am e w o rk u s ed w i d ely in th e  development of Web system, consists of three parts Struts2, Spring and Hibernate  Struts2 is the next-generation of Struts1, and it is a brand new architecture combining Struts1 with WebWork technology. Struts2 provides a series of actions to execute and response the usersê requests Spring is famous for its great concept IOC\(Inversion Of Control\. The relationships among the entities are clearly defined in a series of configuration files. As a result, every entity or component could be seen as liberated that they are low coupled. Spring is responsible for the business layer and ensures the accuracy of business operation  Hibernate is responsible for interacting with the database and almost all kinds of popular databases are supported. The core of Hibernate is Object/Relation Mapping \(ORM\ which creates ça virtual object databaseé that can be used within the programming language. Hibernate separates the data operation from business logic effectively during the system development process. It makes developers focus on the business logic and reduces the difficulty and cost for system migration III S YSTEM C ONSTRUCTION  As showed in Figure 2, system implementation is similar to a common Web system based on SSH2 architecture. The most important difference is that this system relies on a storage cluster based on HDFS. From the userês aspect, storage cluster is transparent, and they donêt know and neednêt care where their files are stored For the developers, the files uploaded by the users wonêt be stored on one certain machine directly. Instead, they may have been split into blocks and distributed on several machines, but the developers neednêt care how to allocate every block, it will be finished by HDFS.In addition, the information associated with the files, such as the information of the users, is still stored in the relational database. When the user wants to download or upload his or her own files, system will first check the userês ID according to the information from the database, then the user will be authorized. Finally files could be uploaded or downloaded through the interaction between the user and the cluster  Figure 3  Figure 4 During the system development process, we set Hadoop pseudo distribution pattern to imitate Hadoop cluster through one machine, another machine running 
   System Architecture The system is designed with two major functions as following a User information management: As the Figure 3 shows, the system administrator has the right to add a new user or remove one. Also a certain userês detail information can be searched though some key fields like user name b File information management: As the Figure 4, the user could upload or download the file from the system. Of course, if necessary, the chosen files can be deleted

MySql works as a database server. In this way, it becomes much easier to develop and debug  The most important function of the system is to make sure that user could upload files to the cluster and download them. Before uploading the files, system will calculate the filesê MD5 code to avoid the duplicate files .The key code is shown as the following  Public String getFileMD5Str\(File file  FileInputStream in = new FileInputStream\(file FileChannel ch = in.getChannel MappedByteBuffer Bb ch.map\(FileChannel.MapMode.READ_ONLY, 0 file.length messagedigest.update\(byteBuffer return bufferToHex\(messagedigest.digest   Public void Upload   FileSystem fs = FileSystem.get\(URI.create\(dest\ conf   OutputStream out = fs.create\(new Path\(dest\, new Progressable\(\ {  publicvoid progress System.out.println\("finish uploading 002      Public void DownLoad   FileSystem fs = FileSystem.get\(URI.create\(dest\ conf   FSDataInputStream  hdfsIS = fs.open\(new Path\(dest   OutputStream out = new FileOutputStream\(mySrc   IOUtils.copyBytes\(hdfsIS, out, 4096,true   IV C ONCLUSIONS  This paper puts forward the design and shows some construction details of a web system to interact with users, and manages the distri buted files based on SSH2 and HDFS. As a result, to a certain degree, we could solve the four problems we just mentioned in the first section. With the help of Hadoop, flexible storage space high reliability and performance are all available. SSH2 provides a stable and visual plat for the users who could share or back up their own files through the Web browser. Most important, both SSH2 and Hadoop are open-source and for free  A CKNOWLEDGMENT This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 71271034, Liaoning Provincial Department of Education Science Research Project \(No.L2012173 and the Cultivation Fund of Dalian Maritime University for National Excellent Doctoral Dissertations NO.2013YB06 R EFERENCES
