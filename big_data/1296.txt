This is especially true in the global travel \nindustry, where billions of messages are being passed between \ntravel agents and travel providers on a continual basis, arriving \nat rates of hundreds/thousands per second \(this includes for nexample availability requests, rate information, bookings, \nchanges to booking and cancellations presents a \nchallenge for traditional Business Intelligence reporting based \non relational databases since a state’ needs to be maintained \ncontinually for multiple millions of bookings, and even more \nso for advanced predictive analytics where the task is not only \nto retrieve data, but to compute complex derived variables and \nstatistical models based on continuously evolving patterns in \nthe underlying data. The only solution is to use a distributed \nplatform that can scale to the volume and velocity required [2].  \nIn this talk we will discuss case studies in the travel \nindustry. The goal is to provide a comprehensive suite of tools \nto support travel agents identify and capture new-sell/cross-\nsell/up-sell opportunities from this continuous flow of data. \nThis includes extraction of ‘true performance’ for each \nagent/agency necessitating clustering to construct like-for-like \npeer-groups based on the travel fingerprints for bookings being \nmade, through to the real-time recommendations of specific \nnamed hotels to go with selected air segments that is based on nsophisticated collaborative filtering as well as a K-Nearest \nNeighbors approach on a feature space calculated over a rolling \nperiod of historical bookings. \nExtracting these features, what we call signals brought in \nthe third V – variety: We use information from various sources, \nincluding customer-generated data scraped from social media \nweb sites, as well as public and proprietary databases, in a \nvariety of formats nHPCC provided a distributed parallel processing \nenvironment with two distinct components to undertake this ntask: parallel processing for large batch jobs – on which the \nbooking ‘state’ and agency peer-group performance was \ncomputed, and multi-threaded concurrent services for the real-\ntime recommendations [3]. \nWe will describe the approach, the technology used, results \nobtained and lessons learned. \n \nKeywords recommender; real-time; collaborative \nfiltering; disparate data \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nWe thank the members of the project team at Opera \nSolutions, specifically Daniel Cholakov, Michael Jahrer and \nAndreas Töscher for their advice and contributions to \nimplementing the solution. \nBIOGRAPHY \n978-1-4673-6404-1/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 67\n nJACOB SPOELSTRA As global head of R&D at Opera \nSolutions, Jacob is in charge of finding and applying new ninnovations in machine learning.

Performance Metrics\nWe consider the real-time and security performance of stor-\nage system, and before modeling the online security manage-\nment mechanism, we introduce some metrics to describe the\nsystem performance.\nCPU utilization, U\(k is the percentage of CPU busy time\nat the kth sampling window.\nVulnerability of ith task, Vi, is the possibility of security\nfailure. If one page failed in security, the whole task can be\nconsidered to miss its security requirement. For one page en-\ncrypted by AES, the possibility of security failure, VP can be\ndefined as the ratio of the number of operations required us-\ning a cryptanalysis to the number of operations required for\na brute-force search [19]. With different cryptography keys,\nrounds and different kinds of attacks, this VP is also disparate.\nFor example, an attack, proposed by Biryukov et. al [20], is\nagainst AES-256 that uses 239 time to recover the complete\n256-bit key of a 9-round version. In this situation, the possi-\nbility of security failure is\nVp = \(2\n39 2256 security\nprotection when attacks happen, the Vi can be calculated as\nthe ratio of security failed pages to the total pages,\nVi =\nepi × VP + \(tpi ? epi 1? VP 5 the lower vulnerability is VP , and the highest\nvulnerability is 1.\nIII. Problem Formulation\nIn this section we first present the task model adopted in\nthis work, and then discuss the optimization problem in our\nsecurity management mechanism.\nA. Task Model\nIn this paper, we consider a set of real-time storage tasks\nrunning periodically in embedded system. Each periodic task\nTi is described as a tuple Ti = {ei, di tpi, SLi}. The execution\ntime, ei, is the sum of the WCETs of security and non-security\nparts, and related to its security level,\nei = e\ns\ni + e\no\ni = e\no\ni + tpi × SLi × 12ms \(6 of Ti. As in Eq.3, tpi is\nthe sum of all encrypted and non-encrypted pages in Ti, and\nthe security level, SLi represents how many percentage of\npages encrypted. This SLi is a control variable in our security\nmanagement and we will discuss it in Section V.\nB. Optimization Problem\nThe goal of this paper is to protect the sensitive data,\nwhich stored in NAND-based flash memory and has the time-\nliness constraint. Corresponding it our proposal should lower\nthe vulnerability and CPU utilization at the same time. A\nlower vulnerability means a strong ability to against malicious\nsnooping, and a lower CPU utilization guarantees the sensitive\ndata can be stored before expiration. But unfortunately, these\ntwo factors are contradictory, which says a lower vulnerability\nmay lead a higher CPU utilization and vice verse. For this\nreason, we try to provide a balanced criteria between vulnera-\nbility and CPU utilization to evaluate the overall performance.\nAt the kth sampling window, the optimization problem is to\nminimize the performance function,\n?× \(U\(k V \(k 7 k and V S are designer-\nprovided parameters. The weights, ? and ?, represent how\nimportant the vulnerability and real-time are. The US and\nV S are the set points of CPU utilization and vulnerability\nrespectively. Relied on this formulated problem, the goal of\nour proposal can be quantified as to find the most appropri-\nate security level for running tasks to minimize Eq.7 in each\nsampling window.\nIV. Motivational Example\nIn order to protect the user data from malicious snoop-\ning, some of them should be encrypted. This encryption is\ncomputationally expensive, where some industrial embedded\nsystems have limited computation resources but tasks have\na stringent time requirement. However, those collected data\nmust be stored before its time limit, otherwise may lead fail-\nure in validity. Hence, it is necessary to find a compromise\nand system-affordable solution to protect user data as well as\nguarantee the real-time constraint. In this section, we will use\nthe set {T1, T2 T3, T4} \(in Fig. 1 compare\ntwo related solutions. Before going further, let us introduce\na definition of Hyper-Period \(HP is the least common\nmultiple of all tasks’ period, and we can analyze the schedule\nonly in this HP. Fig.3\(a illustrates the situation that tasks\nscheduled by RMS but without any encryption operations. It\nis obvious that there are many slack time can be utilized by\n123\n\n \n0 50 100 150 200 250 300\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300\n...\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300\n...\n...\n\(a b constraint\n\(c 4\nS\ne\nFig. 3. Schedule for different solutions.\nsome encryption operations. Actually in many real applica-\ntions, task’s WCET is far less than its deadline, and the slack\ntime is always enough for some kind of security protection [9].\nA simple but widely used approach to protect the sensitive\ndata is to find the highest security level under the real-time\nconstraint. If a set of periodic tasks scheduled by RMS policy,\nthe utilization bound of schedulable is [21],?\nTi?TaskSet\nei\ndi\n? n× \(21/n ? 1 8 in a task set. As in Eq.6, if all\nthe scheduled tasks have the same security level, the result is\n10% pages 


can be encrypted in each task. The corresponding\nschedule illustrates in Fig.3\(b the\nhyper-period is 68%, which is very close to the theoretical uti-\nlization bound calculated by Eq. 8. This low CPU utilization\nguarantees all tasks in this set can be completed before their\nown deadlines, and the sequence diagram can also prove it.\nHowever, from Fig.3\(b are wasted, and there are many slack time can be\nused for a stronger security protection.\nAnother alternative solution would consider the vulnerabil-\nity and real-time performance at the same time. Since the\nsimple solution in Fig.3\(b 10% pages\nin T1, as shown in Fig.3\(c tasks can still satisfy their\nreal-time requirement. The lowest priority task, T4 can be\ncompleted in 247ms and T3 is completed twice in 92ms and\n196ms. If tasks scheduled by this solution, the CPU utilization\nin this hyper-period is 92%, which is far more than the theo-\nretical bound, but actually, no task misses its deadline. The\nreason is that this utilization bound is only a sufficient con-\ndition to guarantee the real-time constraint, not a necessary\none, which means in some situations, it is possible to exceed\nthe utilization bound to achieve a stronger security protection\nand lower vulnerability.\nIn the feedback based dynamic security management, one\ndesign philosophy is similar as the solution in Fig.3\(b utilization controller is deployed. This approach\ncan make the actual utilization fluctuates around the desired\nvalue. The soft real-time is ensured, but the computation re-\nsources are not fully used. The other philosophy is to deploy\nmore than one controller, i.e. an adding vulnerability con-\n...\nWaiting Tasks\nP\nro\ncesso\nr\nMonitor\nUtilization \nController\nActuator\nEncrypted\nPages\nNon-Encrypted\nPages\nControlled Variables\nControl Input\nVulnerability \nController\nFig. 4. Architecture of feedback control mechanism.\ntroller is deployed to make a balance between the utilization\nand vulnerability. Just like the schedule in Fig.3\(c this ap-\nproach can control the utilization and vulnerability at the same\ntime to achieve a better overall performance. In this paper,\nwe will use this idea in the design of our own security manage-\nment.\nV. Design of A Feedback Mechanism\nIn this section we propose a Feedback Vulnerability and\nUtilization Control \(FVUC mechanism to optimize the for-\nmulated problem in Eq.7. First of all, a feedback scheduling\narchitecture and some related variables are introduced. Then,\ntwo proportional-integral controllers are deployed in an estab-\nlished dynamic system model. Finally, we do some analysis\nwork for our proposed feedback based mechanism.\nA. Overview of FVUC\nOur proposal in this paper should monitor the runtime sta-\ntus at two dimensions, the CPU utilization and system vulner-\nability. Utilization constraint guarantees the real-time perfor-\nmance and vulnerability represents system’s ability to against\nmalicious snooping attacks. The final goal of our design is to\nmake a better overall performance in real-time and security,\nwhich says to minimize the Eq.7. Corresponding this design\nrequirement, we design a feedback mechanism which has one\nmonitor, one actuator and two controllers, as shown in Fig.4.\nFrom the perspective of feedback theory, there are two per-\nformance metrics, vulnerability and utilization, which named\n124\ncontrolled variables and can be controlled at each sampling\nwindow. Performance references represent the desired sys-\ntem performance, i.e the desired utilization US and desired\nvulnerability V S . For the task Ti, all its parameters are in-\ndependent from the feedback control, expect the security level\nSLi, which is called manipulated variable This manipulated\nvariable can be dynamically changed by our proposal, to af-\nfect the values of controlled variable, and finally to realize the\ndesign goal.\nAt each sampling window, the surveillance component,\nMonitor, measures the utilization and vulnerability, and send\ntheir values to the Utilization Controller and Vulnerability\nController, respectively. Two controllers compare these two\nmetrics with corresponding performance references to com-\npute an offset, which is named control input. According this\ndelivered control input, Actuator will dynamically change the\nnumber of encrypted pages. Finally, the execution component,\nProcessor, encrypts specific pages, stores both the encrypted\nand non-encrypted pages into NAND flash memory, and set\nthe corresponding flag in each page’s spare area to indicate\nwhether the stored data has been encrypted.\nB. Dynamic System Model\nAs the foundation of the design of feedback controllers, we\nderive a discrete-time system model to characterize the dy-\nnamic relationship between the utilization, vulnerability and\nsecurity level. Before going further, we make an assumption\nthat in one sampling window, all the scheduled tasks have the\nsame security level. Let ?SL\(k se-\ncurity level, ?SL\(k k k ? 1 SL\(k 9 k k k k 10 k k coefficient. Eq.10 can be expanded\nas,\n?b\(k k k k 11 there is\nf\(k k k k k k 12 k 


estimated utilization, which based on task’s\nworst case execution times. Since the actual execution times\nmay be smaller than its worst case, the actual utilization can\nbe modeled as,\nU\(k + 1 k k k k g?\(k k k 13 k actual utilization and estimated utilization.\nIn this equation, the g?\(k k unpre-\ndictable, which decides it cannot be directly used to design\ncontrollers. In Lu’s work [12], they set a maximum value for\neach unknown variable, and in this paper, we use the similar\nidea to deal with the system model. If F = max{f\(k k k + 1 k F ×?SL\(k 14 it has some undecided vari-\nables, such as the G, their values do not impact system’s final\nstatus if it is stable. We will use this utilization model to\ndesign the utilization control in the next section.\nThe definition in Eq.5 has established the relationship be-\ntween the security level and vulnerability,\nV \(k + 1 V \(k 1? VP k 15 which is the foundation of the next step\nto design controllers.\nC. Design of The Controller\nFrom the feedback theory, controllers are the core part of\nour proposed mechanism. In this paper, both of the Uti-\nlization Controller and Vulnerability Controller \(in Fig.4 PI The\nPID \(Proportional-Integral-Derivative simple but can still com-\npensate the steady-state error, so it has been widely used in\nmany related areas 22].\nFor the Utilization Controller, it calculates the first control\ninput by comparing the variable variable U\(k k K\nP\nU × \(US ?

The output of Vulnerability\nController is,\nOV \(k K\nP\nV × \(V \(k V \(i 17 Utilization\nController. The reason why the V \(k K relationship with vulnerability,\nbut positive with utilization.\nHow to calculate the control input by the different outputs,\nOU and OV , is an open problem. Some researchers use the\nminimum of these outputs as the final control input [12], but\nconsidering the formulated problem, in this paper, we use the\nsum of two outputs as the control output, O\(k k k k 18 1-VP z z z z z O\(k in Fig.4 k k ? 1 gs\(k k 19 k k k k is also time-variant and can-\nnot affect the final status if the system is stable.

For the Utilization Controller, a bigger proportional\ncoefficient, KPU , helps to reduce the steady state error and\nincrease the control precision, but may lead the system unsta-\nble. The integral coefficient,KIU , has the similar characteristic.\nHence, it is necessary to find the most appropriate value of KPU\nand KIU , to achieve a higher performance as well as to guar-\nantee the stability. In this paper, we use the Ziegler-Nichols\nmethod to realize the controller tuning.\nStep1: set the KIU = 0.\nStep2: increase the KPU until the system becomes unstable.\nWhen the output of the control loop oscillates with a constant,\nKMU = K\nP\nU where this K\nM\nU is called ultimate gain. If the T\nM\nU\nis the oscillation period at this point, the KPU K\nM\nU /2.2 and\nKIU = \(1.2×KPU maximum value of KPV and K\nI\nV . In some applications,\nthis Ziegler-Nichols method may not be the optimal solution,\nbut the result is acceptable in most situations. In the following\nexperiments, we will use the Ziegler-Nichols method to tune\nthe PI controller, and then verify it by the runtime analysis.\nE. Steady State Error\nTheorem. Ziegler-Nichols method makes the system stability,\nand under this condition, both the utilization and vulnerability\ncontrol guarantee zero steady state error.\nProof. As the Eq.22 shows, the 


utilization and vulnerability\ncontrol are not independent. the performance in utilization\ncontrol can impact the efficiency of vulnerability control and\nvice verse. Solving the equations in Eq.22 can isolate the per-\nformance of utilization and vulnerability,?????\nU\(z 1 + ?×GU ? ? ×GV\nV \(z nUS × ?×GV ?

V S ×GV ×KIV\n\(25 system output is a constant. In another\nword, the steady state error is 0. From Eq.25, we find the\nutilization and vulnerability cannot stabilize at US and V S\nprecisely, since the decision of our proposal is based on these\ntwo metrics and make a balance between them.\nVI. Experimental Results\nIn this section, we conduct a series of synthetic experiments\nto verify the performance of our proposed FVUC mechanism.\nTwo controllers are deployed in this mechanism to achieve the\nutilization and vulnerability control, and all of them will be\nimplemented in .Net environment. Considering the time con-\nsumption of writing operation is far more less than the encryp-\ntion, we ignore the access time of NAND chip. To demonstrate\nthe generality of FVUC, in our experiments, two different task\nsets will be scheduled by two different scheduling strategies.\nIn the first task set, called SIMPLE, we have five period tasks\nand in the second task set, called MEDIUM, ten period tasks\n126\nwill be considered. In order to simulate more precisely, the\nparameters of these tasks are decided by random values. The\ndeadline of ith task, di, is a uniform distribution value from\n900ms to 1100ms, di U\(900ms, 1100ms 40ms, 50ms 15pages, 25pages scheduled by the RMS or EDF algorithms. RMS\nis a fixed-priority scheduling strategy, which has a lower bound\nutilization than EDF, which is a dynamic-priority scheduling\nstrategy. In order to guarantee the real-time constraint, we set\nthe utilization set point of utilization lower than its bound, i.e.,\nfor EDF, US 0.9, but for RMS, US = 0.6. In Section II,\nwe have established a method to quantify the vulnerability of\neach task, which is depend on the security level, SLi, and pos-\nsibility of security failure in one page VP . This VP is very\nsmall \(VP = 2\n217 if one page encrypted by AES-256 approximate VP to 0 to simplify the\nanalysis,\nVi = 1? \(1?

Considering those\nsettings, we donate two combinations, RMS/S and EDF/M,\nas the configurations of our experiments \(in TABLE I 0.05, K\nP\nV = 1.1 and K\nI\nV =\n0.4. In EDF/M configuration, KPU = 0.7, K\nI\nU = 0.03, K\nP\nV =\n1.1, KIV 0.6.\nTABLE I\nTest Configuration\nConfiguration\nScheduling\nStrategy\nTask Set\nPerformance\nReference\nRMS/S RMS SIMPLE\nUS = 60%\nV S = 50%\nEDF/M EDF MEDIUM\nUS = 90%\nV S = 75%\nFor evaluation purpose, we compare our FVUC mech-\nanism with one group of approximation mechanisms,\ni.e.,FUC,FVC,and OPEN. The proposal in this paper has two\ncontrollers, the Utilization Controller and Vulnerability Con-\ntroller, but only a Utilization Controller is deployed in FUC.\nThis FUC mechanism is from FCS mechanism in [12], which\ncan collect the system run-time utilization, and then change\nthe security level of each task to minimize the error between\nactual and desired utilization. The FVC is very similar to\nFUC, which only has a Vulnerability Controller to make the\nactual vulnerability close to desired value. OPEN mechanism\nstatically sets tasks’ security level based on the analysis and\nprediction of WCET and deadline to achieve schedulable uti-\nlization bound and make a lower vulnerability. In RMS/S con-\nfiguration, the security level of each task is 0.3, and in EDF/M\nconfiguration the security level is 0.15. It is clear, our pro-\nposed FVUC is more complicated than both FUC, FVC and\nOPEN so it is necessary to verify whether this complication is\nworth. In order to give a better description, we will calculate\nthe performance function in Eq.7 with these four mechanism\nwhen ? = 1 and ? = 1.\n\(a b c d 25 50 75 100\nUtilization\nVulnerability\nSampling Window \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n0 25 50 75 100\nUtilization\nVulnerability\nSampling Window \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n0 25 50 75 100\nUtilization\nVulnerability\nSampling Window \nFig. 6.

In Fig.6 \(a FVUC converges to 54% and does not change\nsince the 4th sampling window, while the utilization fluctuate\naround 65%, which is above than the set-point 60%. In the\nfurther analysis, we find both the utilization and vulnerability\nexceed their set-points, which means under the configuration\nRMS/S, it is impossible to maintain a high security as well as\nforce the utilization lower than the set-point. This is because\nthe computation resources are not enough. In this situation,\nFVUC makes a balance between the low utilization and low\nvulnerability, and tries to provide a better overall performance.\nIn contrast, the FUC \(in Fig.6\(b vul-\nnerability \(nearly 60 in Fig.6\(c stabilizes in 50%, the\nutilization fluctuate around 70%, which obviously violates the\nset-point. From these two mechanisms, it is clear that either\nFUC or FVC cannot make a balance between utilization and\nvulnerability, and it can only realize the dynamic control in\none direction. If one performance metric, no matter utiliza-\ntion or vulnerability, meets its set-point, another metric will\nbe far away from its desired value. OPEN \(in Fig.6\(d low.

However,\nif consider the utilization and vulnerability at the same time\nand then calculate the performance function \(in Eq.7 better. The utilization bound of RMS is de-\npended on the number of scheduled tasks \(as in Eq.8 theoretical value is 74% when there are 5 five tasks. Com-\nparing with the average utilization of FVUC and FVC, even\nthough higher than the set-point, the actual utilization is still\nlower than the bound. So it is safe to say the real-time con-\nstraint can be guaranteed in FVUC and FVC. This is the rea-\nson to explain why we set the set-point a little lower than the\ntheoretical bound [12] [15].\nFig.7 illustrates the simulation results when the configura-\ntion is EDF/M. In this situation, The run-time status of FVUC\n\(in Fig.7\(a close to our expected, in which the utilization\nfluctuates between 90% and 100% as well as the vulnerability\nmaintains at the 80%. Both these two metrics are higher than\nthe set-points, which is decided by the limited resources can-\nnot provide the enough computation capacity. The FUC \(in\nFig.7\(b similarly to FVUC expect it converges to the\nset-point a little slower. For only the Utilization Controller is\ndeployed, FUC increases the vulnerability to save some com-\nputation capacity, and these saved resources can help to reduce\nthe utilization, and to provide a stronger guarantee of real-time\nrequirement. The performance of FVC \(in Fig.7\(c re-\nduced vulnerability makes the execution times of tasks become\nbigger, and finally leads the utilization always stays nearly at\n100%. Both the performances of FVC and FUC prove the\nconclusion again, that a single controller design approach is\nnot suitable when there are multiple metrics should be consid-\nered. OPEN verifies the EDF/M configuration is available in\nthis experiment. It shows there are indeed some resources can\nbe used to provide some security protections.\nTABLE III\nPerformance comparison with EDF/M configuration\n\(Fixed Period 20.9\nFUC 90.6% 78.2% 42.0\nFVC 99.0% 73.4% 51.6\nThe statistics data is shown in TABLE III. The overall per-\nformance of FVUC is 100% higher than FUC and 150% than\nFVC. This performance improvement is more than in TABLE\nII. From this Experiment I, we can make some conclusions\nhere.\n1. The more heavier of the scheduled tasks set is, the ad-\nvantage of our FVUC more obvious. If the provided com-\nputational resource is totally enough, no matter which\nmechanism applied, the FUC, FVC, or FVUC, the vul-\nnerability and utilization can be guaranteed to maintain\nthe set-points.\n2. Since two controllers deployed, the algorithm in FVUC\nis more complicated, but this complexity is worth to im-\nprove the overall performance.\nB. Experiment II: Varying Period\nFig.8 illustrates the runtime status of FVUC, FVC and FUC\nwith RMS/S configuration. In this set of 


experiments, we\nwant to verify the system performance of FVUC, FUC and\nFVC when the period of scheduling tasks varies in the runtime.\nBefore this test, we define the overloaded windows from the\n40th to 80th sampling window. During this time, tasks’ period\nwill increase 30% in RMS/S configuration, and 10% in EDF/M\nconfiguration.\nFirstly, we compare the performance of FVUC \(in Fig.8\(a in Fig.8\(b overloaded windows, we find an\ninteresting phenomenon that the vulnerability in FUC rapidly\nincreases near 30%, while the utilization fluctuates more dra-\nmatically. On the contrary, the changes of utilization and\nvulnerability in FVUC are mild. In the further analysis, we\nmust admit that the FUC has a stronger ability to guaran-\ntee the real-time performance, because even when the period\nof tasks becomes smaller, the actual utilization is still lower\nthan the schedulable bound \(76 are unstable at these overloaded\nwindows. The setting of controllers’ parameter is from the\nZiegler-Nichols method, which is based on the practical, not\ntheoretical analysis. When tasks’ characteristic happens to\nchange, those setting parameters cannot guarantee the sta-\nbility any more. Hence, although the theoretical analysis is\n128\n \(a b c n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n0 25 50 75 100\nUtilization\nVulnerability\nSampling Window \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n0 25 50 75 100\nUtilization\nVulnerability\nSampling Window \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n0 25 50 75 100\nUtilization\nVulnerability\nSampling Window \nFig. 8.

Utilization and vulnerability when period varying \(with\nEDF/M configuration a b controllers deployed, it is still neces-\nsary if tasks set will be varied dramatically. Finally, we check\nthe performance of FVC. For it does not have any components\nto monitor the utilization, it does not take any special actions\nin the overloaded window. The advantage of FVS is to provide\nthe strongest security protection, but the shortcoming is the\nreal-time being highly ignored.\nTABLE IV\nPerformance comparison with RMS/S configuration\n\(Varying Period 61.7% 279.6\nFUC 60.5% 74.1% 350.9\nFVC 91.0% 50.1% 523.2\nThe statistics of these overloaded windows in shown in TA-\nBLE IV. Note we calculate the average value of performance\nfunction only in the overloaded window. The overall perfor-\nmance of FVUC is 20% higher than FUC, which is not very\nobvious but still acceptable. In the further analysis, we find\nthe average utilization of FVUC is 78.9%, which is above than\nthe utilization bound and far more than it in FUC. The error\nof average utilization in FVUC and FUC is even close to 20%.\nHence, it must be careful to deploy the FVUC in real-time\nsensitive system. Although FVS has a lowest vulnerability,\nits utilization is too high to be acceptable in any real-time\nsystems.\nFig.9 is the runtime status of FVUC and FUC with EDF/M\nconfiguration. Both the FVUC and FUC have the similar be-\nhavior as in Fig.8. The statistic in TABLE V also shows the\nimprovement of our proposal. But clearly analyze the perfor-\nmance in overloaded windows, we can find that FVUC cannot\nto realize its function in utilization control. This is because\nthe maximum of utilization is 100% and the maximum error\nUS?U\(k k nIn this situation, the impact of vulnerability control is far more\nobvious than utilization control, and even leads the utilization\ncontrol failed. So, if the utilization set-point closes to 100%\nand overload is heavy, it is necessary to change the value of\nKIU and K\nP\nU to increase the influence of utilization control.\nTABLE V\nPerformance comparison with EDF/M configuration\n\(Varying Period 91.3\nC.

But if change the PI con-\ntroller to proportional controller, more time will be cost to\nbuild the stability, and the vulnerability cannot maintain at a\ncertain value all the time. The similar situation happened in\nthe utilization, in which it converges to set-point faster in PI\ncontroller. Through this test, it can be concluded that com-\nparing 


with the proportional controller, PI controller can help\nto guarantee the stability at the cost of increased computation\ncomplicity.\n129\n \(a b 100\nUtilization\nVulnerability\nSampling Window \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n0 25 50 75 100\nUtilization\nVulnerability\nSampling Window \nFig. 10.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
