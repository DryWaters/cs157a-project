In a graph relationships are stored using vertices and edges a vertex may represent an object or concept and the relationships between them are represented by edges The power of graph data structures lies in the ability to encode complex relationships between data and provide a framework to analyze the impact of the relationships Many real-world graphs can be classiìed as  where vertex degree follows a scale-free power-law distribution  6  The de gree of a v erte x is the count of the number of edges connecting to the vertex A power-law vertex degree distribution means that the majority of vertices will have a low degree fewer than 16 for Graph500 while a select few will have a very large degree with degree following a power-law distribution These high-degree vertices are called level is lled with all unvisited neighbors of level A triangle is a set of vertices In our previous work we addressed the challenge of achieving DRAM-like performance when some portion of the program state resides in I/O bus-connected NVRAM capable of low latency random access  5  W e identiìed that high levels of concurrent I/O are required to achieve optimal performance from NVRAM devices e.g NAND Flash this is the underlying motivation for designing highly concurrent asynchronous graph traversals We also identiìed that the Linux I/O system software introduces many bottlenecks This has led many application developers to use the Node-local or node-near NVRAM is gaining traction in the HPC environment often motivated by improving the performance of checkpointing in traditional HPC applications  9  Our w ork le v erages the NVRAM for data-intensi v e applications Examples of HPC systems with NVRAM include Hyperion and Coastal at LLNL Trestles and Flash Gordon at SDSC TSUBAME2 at Tokyo Tech The architecture and conìguration of NVRAM in supercomputing clusters is an active research topic To our knowledge our work is the rst to integrate node-local NVRAM with distributed memory at extreme scale for important data intensive problems helping to inform the design of future architectures 100 1,000 10,000 100,000

partitions and  then at least one processor will process more than its fair share of visitors vertices The simplest partitioning is  where each partition receives an equal number of vertices and their associated adjacency list In 1D the adjacency list of a vertex is assigned to a single partition This simple partitioning leads to signiìcant data imbalance shown in Figure 2 because a single adjacency list can exceed the average edge count per partition Data imbalance is computed from the distribution of edges per partition Recent work has advocated the use of adjacency list across to  we designed a partitioning based on a sorted  The underlying storage of each edge list partition is exible we choose to store each local partition as a e.g BFS level This means that state is replicated for vertices whose adjacency list spans multiple partitions The The number of incoming edges to hub vertices in scale-free graphs can grow very large signiìcantly larger than the total number of edges per partition To mitigate the communication hotspots created by hubs we selectively use ghost information Ghosts can be used to lter excess visitors reducing the communication hotspots created by high in-degree hubs Ghosts are discussed further in Section IV-B  Effectively partitioning many scale-free graphs is difìcult and often not feasible Without good graph separators parallel algorithms will require signiìcant communication Speciìcally when the parallel partitioned graph contains

pairs of processors share cut edges in the worst case creating all-to-all communication We apply communication routing and aggregation through a synthetic network to reduce dense communication requirements For dense communication patterns where every process needs to send messages to all other processes we route the messages through a topology that partitions the communication We have experimented with 2D and 3D routing topologies Figure 4 illustrates a 2D routing topology that reduces the number of communicating channels a process requires to Ghost information replicates distributed state to avoid communication By replicating the state of vertices with large in-degree the communication hotspot associated with that vertex can be reduced The ideal case is to reduce the communication from hundreds of millions down to  where each partition only requires communicating once per hub vertex The ghost information is never globally synchronized and represents only the local partitions view of remote hubs Each partition locally identiìes high-degree vertices from its edges targets to become ghost vertices Ghosts cannot be used for every algorithm so each algorithm must explicitly declare ghost usage We investigate the useful number of ghosts in our experimental study in Section VII-E 2 The number of ghosts required for scale-free graphs is small because the number of high-degree vertices is small Ghosts can only be used as an imprecise lter for algorithms such as BFS because the ghosts are not globally synchronized Algorithms that require precise counts of events such as k-core discussed in Section VI-B  cannot use ghosts

 This reduction in the number of communicating pairs comes at the expense of message latency because messages require two hops to reach their destination In addition to reducing the number of communicating pairs 2D routing increases the amount of message aggregation possible by  it provides the parallelism and creates a data-driven ow of computation Traversal algorithms are created using a visitor abstraction which allows an algorithm designer to deìne vertex-centric procedures to execute on traversed vertices with the ability to pass visitor state to other vertices The visitor pattern is discussed in Section IV-A Each asynchronous traversal begins with an initial set of visitors which may create additional visitors dynamically depending on the algorithm and graph topology All visitors are asynchronously transmitted scheduled and executed When the visitors execute on a vertex they are guaranteed exclusive access to the vertexês data The traversal completes when all visitors have completed and the distributed queue is globally empty In our previous work  4  we used an asynchronous visitor pattern to compute Breadth-First Search Single Source Shortest Path and Connected Components in shared and external memory We used multi-threaded and vertices The required visitor procedures and state are outlined in Table I Table I V ISITOR P ROCEDURES AND S TATE Required Description pre visit  Performs a preliminary evaluation of the state and returns The has the following functionality that may be used by a visitor or initiating algorithm  pushes a visitor into the visitor queue

The performance of BFS and triangle counting are dependent on topological properties of the graph For BFS the performance is dependent on the diameter the longest shortest-path of the graph Using the Small World graph vs traditional 1D partitioning we show the weak scaling of both with BFS on RMAT graphs on BG/P in Figure 12 Because 1D partitioning suffers from data imbalance the graph sizes in the experiments were reduced to prevent 1D from running out of memory The weak scaling of edge list partitioning is almost linear while 
vertices twice the size as experiments on BG/P Intrepid We expect our approach to continue scaling as larger HPC clusters with node-local NVRAM become available To experiment with the effects of increasing NVRAM usage per compute node we performed an experiment where the computational resources are held constant while the data size increases The results of our data scaling experiment are shown in Figure 9 As the data size increases from 34 billion to 1 trillion edges 10.8 TB the additional data we store on NVRAM results in only a moderate performance reduction The overall performance reduction from DRAMonly to 32x larger graph stored in NVRAM is only 39 This is a signiìcant increase in data size with only a moderate performance degradation Results using our distributed external memory BFS for the Graph500 are shown in Table II In addition to the HyperionDIT cluster we performed experiments on Trestles at the San Diego Supercomputing Center SDSC and Leviathan LLNL Each compute node in Trestles has commodity SATA SSDs and shows that our approach is not limited to enterprise class NVRAM Leviathan is a single-node system using implementations from our previous multithreaded work  4  Le viathan has 1TB of DRAM and 12TB of Fusion-io in a single host These represent 3 of 8 total systems on the November 2011 Graph500 list traversing trillion-edge graphs To demonstrate the effects of

vertices and undirected edges We performed a weak scaling study in which each compute node stores 17 billion edges on its local NVRAM roughly 169GB in a compressed sparse row format The results of the weak scaling are shown in Figure 8 at 64 compute nodes the graph has over one trillion undirected edges and probabilities shown above each datapoint Maximum vertex degree used for x-axis Computational resources xed at 4096 cores of BG/P Graph size is xed at vertices and 
vertices and undirected edges undirected edges per core generator we show the effects of increasing diameter on BFS in Figure 10 By decreasing the small-world random rewire probability while keeping the size of the graph constant the diameter of the graph increases The increasing diameter causes the performance of BFS to decrease Similarly the performance of triangle counting is dependent on the maximum vertex degree Using the Preferential Attachment graph generator with an added step of random rewire we show the effects of increasing hub degree while keeping the graph size constant in Figure 11 The topological effects can also be seen in the algorithm analysis in Sections VI-D 1 and VI-D 3

We experimented with the effects on BFS performance of choosing different size on a graph with vertices on 4096 cores of BG/P The results of this experiment are shown in Figure 13 where the percent improvement of ghosts per partition vs no ghosts is shown Using a single ghost shows more than a 12 improvement and 512 ghosts shows an 19.5 improvement This improvement is highly dependent on the graph and as hubs grow to larger sizes it may have a larger effect For scale-free graphs when  there is an opportunity for ghosts to have a positive effect because at least one partition will have multiple edges to  where is the number of distributed partitions and is the graph For the sparse Graph500 datasets with average degree of 16 this may occur for as low as 256 partitions and is independent of graph size Second under weak scaling the amount of algorithm state e.g BFS level stored per partition scales with  where is the total number of vertices This will ultimately hit a scaling wall where the amount of local algorithm state per partition exceeds the capacity of the compute node Finally with respect to our desire to use semi-external memory where the vertex set is stored in in-memory and the edge set is stored in external memory hypersparse partitions are poor candidates to apply semi-external memory techniques because the in-memory requirements proportional to the number of vertices are larger than the external memory requirements proportional to the number of edges Our has been explored by Willcock  20  Acti v e messages are routed through a synthetic network to improve dense communication scalability A key difference to our work is that their approach has been designed for the Bulk Synchronous Parallel BSP model and is not suitable for asynchronous graph traversals The STAPL Graph Library  21  pro vides a frame w ork that abstracts the user from data-distribution and parallelism and supports asynchronous algorithms to be expressed
