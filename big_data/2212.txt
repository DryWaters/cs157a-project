The injected fuel is atomized into tiny \ndroplets so as to form a mixture of the vaporized fuel and air. \nCertain portion of the vaporized fuel or fuel droplet would \ncondense on the wall of the intake manifold and intake value, \nforming the fuel puddle, which has a significant impact on the air \nto fuel ratio \(A/F ratio giving \nrise to excessive exhaust emissions and extra fuel consumption, as \nwell as the driveability and catalyst efficiency problems. Hence, \nsome advanced control schemes should be applied. The model \npredictive control methodology is proposed to compensate for \nA/F ratio excursion during engine transient operations at throttle \ntip in or tip out. In light of the fact that additional computational \ncomplexity involves in nonlinear intelligent control approaches \nand big approximation error occurs in simple linear approaches, \nthe relatively simple but powerful nonlinear Markov Chain \nMonte Carlo \(MCMC nMCMC is a general approach for obtaining random samples at \nthe stationary probability to substitute arbitrary type of the \nposterior density.

Excellent match between the \nmodel prediction data and actual experimental data is observed \nusing the MCMC approach with the low computation cost. \nKeywords — Model Predictive Control Markov Chain Monte \nCarlo, Wall Wetting, Transient Fuel Control \n \nI. INTRODUCTION \n \nFor automotive engines such as the Port Fuel Injection \(PFI nexperience transient operation modes, such as the cold start, \nabnormal sudden acceleration and deceleration accompanied \nby throttle tip in or tip out. When the instantaneous A/F ratio \nis far from the stoichiometry 14.64 TWC working range, the fuel economy and vehicle \ndriveability are downgraded, and exhaust emission levels of \nHC and CO increase at lean mode \(A/F ratio<14.64 A/F ratio>14.64 the same \ntime, the fuel puddle keeps condensing on and evaporating \nfrom the intake manifold, intake valves cylinder wall and \npiston crown, which leads to the typical wall wetting effect. \nDespite of many factors of engine design itself, such as initial \ncalibration, exhaust gas recirculation \(EGR e.g. injection pressure and angle this \nissue. So many linear and nonlinear approaches are proposed \nand implemented [1, 2, 8] to solve transient fuel problems. \n \nIn early studies, the wall wetting fuel evaporation theory is \nimplemented on transient fuel modeling of single cylinder \nspark ignition engine. For models to be precise and robust nagainst disturbances, extra fuel compensation schemes are \nrequired to ensure the accuracy [3]. A multi-component fuel \nmodel for the engine wall wetting effect can predict real fuel \nbehavior and analyze various fuel compositions. It generates \nseveral models to describe actual physical characteristics. The nbackflow process has a negative effect on the fuel behavior. \nThe multi-component model is sensitive across different \ncoolant temperature [4]. The automotive engine is in general \nmodeled as a high order linear system or a nonlinear model. \nTo shorten the transient fuel calibration process across \nmanufacture lines, two hidden layer feed forward neural \nnetwork is utilized to train the neural net of wall wetting \nmodel data for ? and multipliers. The output layer units are \nlinear. The predicted ? and ? multipliers present proper air fuel ncompensation for the transient fuel calibration. However, a \nlarge set of testing data is required for training. A simple \nlinear least squares approach is presented to solve transient \nfuel control problem. The computation complexity is greatly \nreduced. It is much easier than nonlinear estimation. From the \nnumerical simulation results of both throttle tip in and throttle \ntip out, correlated predictions are obtained. It is an efficient \nway to solve the transient fuel problems with relatively little \neffort with a tradeoff of the approximation accuracy [5-8]. A \nneural network-based control system is proposed for fine \ncontrol of the intake A/F ratio in a bi-fuel engine. The neural \nnetwork-based control system is developed to allow the nconversion of a gasoline ECU to a bi-fuel form with \ncompressed natural gas at minimal cost. The effectiveness of \nthe neural control system is demonstrated by using a \nsimulation of a Dodge four-stroke bi-fuel engine [9]. The \nrecurrent neuro-fuzzy network intelligent approach is used for \nfuel injection control of spark ignition engines. The problem is \nsensitive because the dynamics of intake manifold air-fuel nflow is highly nonlinear and multivariable. The predictive \ncontroller is designed based on nonlinear inverse dynamics of \nthe A/F ratio. The control actions can be reached analytically \nto avoid time-consuming 


calibration. Responses of controller \nmatch to the measured fuel injection rate generated by the \n electronic control unit. The system is applied to compressed \nnatural gas vehicle in real time [10]. With a strict requirement \nof modeling accuracy and computation cost to solve transient \nfuel problem, the simple nonlinear approach with low \ncomputation load is necessary. Markov chain Monte Carlo \n\(MCMC as a universal technique to \ngenerate typical samples from a probability density function in \nthe high-dimensional space. Its applications can cover broad \nareas of engineering and science, such as pattern recognition \nand economics. The Markov chain iteratively searches across \nthe space in order to converge to a stationary distribution, \nwhose current state solely relies on the most recent previous \nstates. For the Markov chain’s application in simplifying the \nstochastic optimal control problem, hybrid LQG models nmodulated by a finite state Markov chain. The optimization is \nsolved via dynamic programming and associated Hamilton-\nJacobi-Bellman equation. To reduce computation complexity, \nnearly optimal control is proposed and implemented. The \nweakly irreducible states of Markov chains at each class are \naggregated into a single state by the nearly optimal scheme. \nMismatch on convergence characteristics between nearly \nstochastic optimal control and stochastic optimal control can \nbe investigated using maximum likelihood estimation [11-12]. \n \nA MCMC method has been introduced into fingerprint image \nsegmentation. It generates a random sequence of closed curves \nbased on the Markov chain as the boundary.  It is simulated by \nMonte Carlo method so as to converge to the maxima. The \nclosed curve is regarded as the ideal boundary curve, which is \nrobust to low-quality images [13]. The practical applications \nof MCMC are fairly diversified. A reversible jump Markov \nchain Monte Carlo is used to construct reversible Markov \nchain samplers that jump between subspaces of different ndimensionality. A first order Markov random field model is \napplied where singleton energies derive from a multivariate \nGaussian distribution and second order potentials favor similar \nclasses in neighboring pixels The proposed algorithm locates \na most likely number of classes, associated model parameters \nand generates segmentation. The algorithm has been validated \non a database of real images with human segmented ground ntruth [14]. A MCMC algorithm is used to estimate the Potts \nparameter and Bayesian model parameters jointly using \nlikelihood-free Metropolis–Hastings algorithm. The above \nalgorithm is successfully applied to the real bi-dimensional \nSAR and tridimensional ultrasound images [15]. A novel \nsampling-based tracking scheme is proposed for the abrupt \nmotion problem in Bayesian filtering framework. Stochastic \nMonte Carlo sampling is introduced into the Bayesian filter \ntracking framework. The novel MCMC sampler is proposed \nwith intensive adaptation to further improve the sampling \nefficiency. It shows the effectiveness in dealing with various ntypes of abrupt motions [16]. A new Bayesian detection \nmethod is developed that is applicable to synchronous code-\ndivision multiple-access and multiple-input multiple-output \ncommunication systems. MCMC simulation techniques are \nused to obtain Bayesian estimates of transmitted symbols. The \nunderlying problem of the posteriori probability is viewed as a \nmultidimensional Monte Carlo integration. It is shown that the \nMCMC detectors with sphere decoding have superior \nperformance to the minimum mean square error turbo \ndetectors 17]. The convergence behaviors of MCMC are \ninvestigated in digital communication applications. The ngeometric convergence property is reached by considering \nchains or marginal chains corresponding to the transmitted \ndigital symbols, which take values from a finite discrete set. \nFrom specific applications, it is noticed that the differential \nencoding, parameter constraining, collapsing and grouping are \nefficient ways of accelerating the convergence of the MCMC \nalgorithms, especially in the presence of the channel phase nambiguity [18].  \n \nIn this research, Markov Chain Monte Carlo \(MCMC predictive control of the \ntransient fuel control problems with typical cases of throttle \ntip in and tip out on a basis of the ? and ? model. Two \nparameter and multiple variable based system optimization is \nobtained where the accurate match between prediction and \nmeasurement has been observed. It has shown MCMC is \ncapable of solving the complicated nonlinear engine control \nproblems with ease. \n \n \nII. WALL WETTING MODEL \n \nTwo basic transient fuel schemes are referred to as transient \nfuel calibration and fuel perturbation. Fuel perturbation has \nbeen developed by European Automotive Operations using a \ndynamometer procedure, without taking into account the \nchanges of engine intake air flow rate and intake manifold \nabsolute pressure along with the varying throttle opening. \nTransient fuel control is a more comprehensive approach, \ncovering several major steps such the chassis dynamometer \ncalibration, intake manifold model for air charge prediction nfueling dynamic model to compensate for fuel injection delay \nand transient fuel calibration model to compensate for A/F \nratio excursion. Here transient fuel control is proposed to \ncompensate for the A/F ratio excursion and fuel injection \ndelay, which is based on the fundamental ? and ? parameter \nmodel. It is assumed that the engine should be calibrated to \noperate at the stoichiometric A/F ratio for the steady state nOccasionally the A/F ratio could be slightly rich for more \nengine power output or slightly lean for 


potential better fuel \neconomy. A sudden excursion \(rise or drop time instant of throttle tip in and tip \nout, so the wall wetting model has been designed as the \ncompensation technique to avoid deterioration of powertrain \nperformance on the fuel economy, TWC efficiency, vehicle ndriveability as well as the emission levels of HC, CO and \nNOx. The model also provides robustness against various \ntypes of disturbances, such as A/C power ON/OFF and power \nsteering, and so on. The dynamic model parameters should \nthen be identified using either linear or nonlinear approach. \n \n  \nFig. 1. Transient Fuel Wall Wetting Model \n \nFor ideal cases, the intake air charge at each engine cycle is a \nconstant while the injected fuel is equal to the fuel transported \ninto the cylinder under stoichoimetry. But at the real engine noperating conditions, the desired fueling rate may differ across \ndifferent cycles. The dynamics of fuel transport from injector \ninto the cylinder is the transient fuel dynamics. In Fig. 1, the \nwall wetting effect is described by the ? and ? transient fuel \nmodel, where ? represents the fraction of injected fuel forming nthe puddle and ? represents the time constant \(fuel delay evaporates in every cycle \nwhile an extra amount of fuel is scheduled to compensate for \nwall wetting. The desired mass fuel comprises of a portion of \ninjected fuel and a portion of evaporated puddle fuel. In fact nthe amount of fuel entering and leaving the puddle can hardly \nbe measured directly, ? and ? model is widely adopted to \nsimulate the transient fuel process.   \n \nThe balanced puddle fuel mass equation is shown in \(1 nPuddle\nP uddle Inj\nmm = ?m -\n?\n        \(1 g injected \nfuel flow rate \(g/s sec constant for the fuel delay in \nthe puddle. Its discrete form of the transient fuel dynamics is \nexpressed as 2 2 mInjk is the \nmass of injected fuel of the present step. The injected fuel \nmass is the sum of the desired fuel mass and transient \ncompensation mass: \n \n mInjk = mDesk+ mTransk                                  \(3 nWith proper compensation, the objective is that the mass air \nflowrate must be proportional to mass fuel flowrate at the A/F \nratio equivalent to the stoichiometry. As a result, the mass of \ntransient compensation fuel has the form as \(4 4 compensation is to reach a pseudo \nsteady state where the fuel condensing into the puddle should \nbe equal to the fuel evaporating from the puddle. For a \nspecified period of transient operation, the data of the A/F nratio, cylinder air charge \(ma mTrans experiments. For throttle \ntip in and throttle tip out, fuel can be in either lean mode \(A/F \nratio<14.64 rich mode \(A/F ratio>14.64 nrate over the corresponding mean value of A/F ratio during \nexactly the same lean or rich mode period. The base fuel \ntransition curve of the lean mode and rich mode has a shape \nsimilar to the step function nmDesk\(Lean mAk k Lean 5 Rich mAk k Rich 6 nwhere, ? represents the A/F ratio, mA represents the cylinder \nair charge rate and mDes represents the fuel flow rate. The \ninjected fuel mass should be the sum of the desired fuel mass \nand the compensation fuel mass From \(1 4 7 j\n1 2 3\n1\n2 1 2 3\n3\n? \(? -1 1 1 1 1\nx\n? \(? -1 1 x , x , x 7 model in \(7 and \ntip out, numerical simulations will be conducted so that the \npredictive control values will match the experimental data. A \nsimple low order nonlinear model is proposed for problem \nsolving rather than the high order linear model and complex \nnonlinear approaches.  \n \nIII. MARKOV CHAIN AND MARKOV CHAIN MONTE CARLO \n nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo \(MCMC low \ndimensional but also the high-dimensional cases. As a \nmathematical model for the stochastic systems Markov chain \nitself is ergodic, aperiodic, reversible which is controlled by a \ntransition probability. Monte Carlo integration is one of most \nimportant sampling approaches that estimate mathematical \nexpectation by the empirical mean. In MCMC, a Markov \nchain is designed to have the posterior distribution being its \nstationary probability so that the definite integral can be \ncomputed numerically. It is insensitive to high dimensionality \nwhen MCMC is used to generate a set of samples from the \nposterior probability distribution The stochastic system \nconverges to stationary distribution upon iterative searching. \nIn context, maximum likelihood estimation is used for setting \nthe initial values. But in fact, in terms of a proper iteration nnumber, the inference from MCMC sampling is independent \nof the initial values, which is neglected eventually and is \nreferred to as "burn in".   \n The Metropolis-Hastings \(M-H MCMC simulation approaches.

SOLVING WALL WETTING MODEL USING MCMC \n \nMCMC has been proposed to solve the transient fuel control \nproblem based on the typical nonlinear and ? wall wetting \nmodel. From \(7 parameters is designed. From the MCMC \nmodel being determined via some experimental data, model \npredictive control is implemented using numerical simulations \nto predict the upcoming testing data based on the parameters \nbeing optimized. Comparisons will be made between the \nprediction data and experimental data. For both cases of \nthrottle tip in and tip out, the desired fuel mass being predicted \nand actual fuel mass being measured match each other with \nremarkable similarities.

Standard Deviation \(Throttle Tip Out throttle tip in throttle tip out between the two is the \ncompensation fuel. The plots on bottom are comparisons of \nthe actual fuel measured from testing data and the results from \nthe MCMC predictive control model. It shows clearly that the \nMCMC provides an accurate prediction. So the MCMC model \nis successful in solving transient fuel control problems It is \nstraightforward without extra computational complexity of \nclassical nonlinear approaches. It can also deal with high \ndimensional nonlinear cases. From Fig. 3 and Fig. 6, the \nnonlinear MCMC model has reached relatively steady state \nwithin 500 iterative cycles. In Fig. 4 and Fig. 7, small standard \ndeviations can be observed. On the other hand, in order to \nillustrate superiority of the MCMC approaches over some \nlinear transient fuel control approaches, two other functions \nare introduced. The steady state error \(sum of square error 13 14 much lower than \nthe linear approaches. \n \nS\n\(s s s s x , x , x x , x x 13 s s s s x , x , x x , x , x 14 nTABLE 1.

MCMC is \nsuccessfully applied on model predictive control of wall nwetting phenomenon by constructing a Markov chain on the \nstate space whose stationary distribution is used to replace the \nposterior distribution. Monte Carlo integration is introduced so \nthat random samples of the integrand used in MCMC are \ncorrelated with respect to equilibrium distributions in order to \ncompute the definite integral via numerical methods. Two \nparameters in the classical ? and ? model can be optimized by nnonlinear MCMC transient fuel model preditive control with \nthe slight mismatch between the amount of model predicted \nfuel and desired fuel. Unlike intelligent control approaches at \ntremendous computation cost and other linear approaches with \nhigh appromation errors, MCMC is a straightforward way to \nhandle he nonlinear problem with less computation cost and \ninsensitive to the high dimensionality. The simulation results \nhave verified the strength of the proposed MCMC approach in \ndealing with the transient fuel control problem. \n \n REFERENCES \n[1] J.

between the MSL flight computer and the Electra-\nLite UHF Transceiver that resulted in constraints on nallowable command data product size and development of a \ncomplex buffer management system to avoid truncating \ndownlink frames.  While operational workarounds were \nultimately identified, these idiosyncrasies resulted in more \ncomplex ground processes and delayed other critical relay \ntests.  Future missions should ensure early and thorough \ndocumentation and validation of the end-to-end relay data \npath. \nVerification Validation \(V&V including during the cruise phase of the mission.  \nWhile these were addressed prior to arrival at Mars, and nactual surface operations have proceeded smoothly, it would \nhave been desirable to identify these issues earlier.  The \nchallenge here, which is common to the previous \nexperiences with MER and PHX, is that the testing timeline \nis dictated by the lander mission’s V&V test program and \ntestbed accessibility.  The Mars Exploration Program may \nneed to establish more formal guidelines for the scope and \nschedule of testing related to verification and validation of \nrelay services, and ensure that all missions develop their test nschedules and corresponding resource profiles to meet those \nguidelines. \nEnd-to-End Relay Testbeds:  The fidelity of the end-to-end \ntestbeds for relay system testing can play a significant role \nin the overall success of the V&V test campaign.  For the \nMSL-MRO link, both the orbiter and lander projects had \nhigh fidelity spacecraft testbeds resident at JPL, with \nEngineering Models of the Electra and Electra-Lite ntransceivers, and with flight-like representations of the \nspacecraft Command & Data Handling \(C&DH subsystem.  \nWhile these testbeds were located at separate sites within \nthe JPL campus, fiber optic links supported signal flow \nbetween them, as well as integration of a high-fidelity link \nchannel simulator capable of emulating realistic time \nvariation of link amplitude, frequency, and delay, enabling \nthorough end-to-end data flow testing over a range of flight-\nlike signal conditions.  For ODY and MEX, however, each \norbiter project had only a portable test set available at JPL to \nsupport cross-project testing with MSL, each with a flight-\nlike UHF transceiver but with lower fidelity representations \nof the orbiter C&DH.  This limited the scope of ground \ntesting possible on the MSL-ODY and MSL-MEX links.  \nThis, combined with some non-flight-like aspects of the \nODY test set that were discovered late in the V&V test \ncampaign, resulted in the deferral of full validation and use \nof the MSL-ODY forward link capability until well after \nlanding.  The conclusions here are that high-fidelity testbeds \nincrease the robustness of end-to-end relay testing; when \nprogrammatic considerations limit the test hardware fidelity, \nit is essential to clearly document and assess any non-flight-\nlike aspects of the testbed infrastructure. \nElectromagnetic Interference:  Uncertainty in the MRO nEMI environment resulted in significant concern prior to \nMSL arrival as to whether Curiosity would be able to \nachieve the desired 250 Mb/sol data return via the MRO \nrelay path.  This resulted in a large amount of MRO flight \nand ground testing to attempt to better quantify the EMI \nimpacts as a function of Electra return link frequency.  It \nalso drove the need for a lengthy commissioning phase \nduring the first few months of MSL surface operations, to \ncarefully monitor performance as each MRO science \ninstrument was powered on Electra’s frequency-agility \nturned out to be an important tool in mitigating the EMI \nimpacts.  In hindsight earlier and more thorough flight \ntesting could have provided more confidence in the \npredicted MRO relay performance; however, such testing \nwould have required interruption of ongoing MRO science \nobservations Ultimately, future missions will want to \naddress EMI issues earlier in the spacecraft/instrument \ndevelopment cycle to identify and mitigate any spurious \nemissions prior to launch. \n6. CONCLUSIONS \nNASA’s ODY and MRO orbiters and ESA’s MEX orbiter \nembody an international network of Mars relay orbiters, \nproviding essential telecommunication services to the Mars \nScience Laboratory mission.  All three orbiters provided ncomplementary coverage of MSL’s EDL, acquiring tracking \nand telemetry data from MSL’s UHF transmission that ncould have provided essential information for fault \nreconstruction had a mission-ending anomaly occurred nduring EDL.  Since landing, ODY and MRO are providing \nthe highest levels of data return yet achieved for a Mars \nlander, with over 45 Gb of Curiosity data returned over the \nfirst 90 sols of the surface mission.  Key to this level of \nperformance are a number of new capabilities in the Electra \nand Electra-Lite UHF Transceivers on MRO and MSL, \nrespectively, including higher data rates, frequency-agile \noperations, and adaptive data rates, as well as the dedication \nof the operations teams on each mission and the MaROS nmultimission relay operations tools and processes \nsupporting them. \n \n   978-1-4673-1813-6/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE \n 11 \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThe research described in this paper was carried out at the \nJet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of \nTechnology, under a contract with the National Aeronautics \nand Space Administration. \nREFERENCES  \n [1] Charles D.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
