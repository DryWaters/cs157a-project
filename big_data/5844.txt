regions in which objects frequently appear to predict locations Association relationships among regions are represented as association rules By exploring association relationships among regions prior works are able to have a good accuracy for location prediction However with a large amount of trajectory data produced a huge amount of association rules is expected Furthermore trajectory data has both the spatial and temporal information To further enhance the accuracy of location prediction one could utilize not only spatial information 
but also temporal information to estimate locations of objects In this paper we propose a spatial-temporal trajectory model abbreviated as STT to capture movement behaviors of objects STT is represented as a probabilistic suf\002x tree with both spatial and temporal information of movements Note that STT is able to discover sequential traversal relationships among regions and for each region STT derives the corresponding probabilities about the time when objects appear With the nature of probabilistic 
suf\002x tree we could use a compact structure to capture movement behavior of objects compared to association rules proposed In light of STT we further propose an algorithm to traverse STT for location prediction By exploring both the spatial and temporal information of STT the accuracy of location prediction is improved To evaluate our proposed STT and prediction algorithm we conduct experiments on the synthetic dataset generated from real datasets Experimental results shows that our proposed STT is able to capture both spatial and temporal

Hence mining movement behaviors could provide a powerful way to enhance the accuracy of location predictions A signi\003cant amount of research effort has proposed some algorithms to mine movement behaviors Movement behaviors are represented as different kinds of knowledge patterns in prior works For example movement behaviors are de\003ned as sequential patterns 7 8 9 2 and association rules 3 10 11 W ithout loss of generality  g i v en a set of trajectories algorithms of mining movement behaviors will 003rst extract some regions with a certainty degree of popularity which are referred to as hot regions Then original trajectories are transformed as sequences of hot regions With a given sequences of hot regions movement behaviors are thus de\003ned as trajectory patterns that frequently appear among sequences of hot regions Clearly trajectory patterns imply that objects usually follow similar movement behaviors For example users usually have their routings from their home to of\003ces As such one could utilize trajectory patterns as another hints to predict locations of users at speci\003ed future time It is shown in that by e xploring association rules of hot re gions the accuracy of location predictions with a far future time is improved compared to the traditional method i.e motion function approaches In reality with a considerable amount of trajectories the number of association rules is dramatically increased Furthermore association rules do not contain any temporal information about movement behaviors Thus in this paper we propose a spatial-temporal trajectory model abbreviated as STT in which both sequential relationships among hot regions and the corresponding appearing time information about objects are captured The STT is designed to mine movement behaviors in terms of both spatial and temporal domains Consider an example in Figure 1 where a user has two trajectory patterns i.e T1 and T2 In T1 the user usually has the routing path from his home i.e A to his study place i.e C alone with the main street i.e B As can be seen in Figure 1 our trajectory model includes not only travel time information between two hot regions but also appearing time information about when this user appears Furthermore since these two sequential patterns have two common regions i.e A and B These sequential patterns could be represented as a compact model in which common regions i.e A and B are shared by two trajectory patterns Traditionally sequential patterns will have supports that indicate their appearing counts among trajectories In this example T1 i.e A 002 B 002 C as higher support than T2 Assume that recent movements are A and B and this user travels at region B around 10:00am From these two sequential patterns the next location of this user is C since T1 has higher support However by considering the time information in STT one could imply that if a user moves to C the time will be 11:00 i.e the sum of the current time and time interval between B and C From STT the appearing probability at region C at 11:00 via the routing path A 002 B is zero On the other hand one could infer from our STT that this user may appear at region E at 12:00 with the probability larger than zero Thus in this case the next location of the user is region E showing that by exploring both spatial and temporal information the accuracy of location prediction could be enhanced Spatial-temporal trajectory model is represented as a variant of probabilistic suf\003x tree with both spatial and temporal information of movements STT is able to discover the sequential relationships among regions in spatial domain and derives the corresponding time probabilities of objects appear in temporal domain Furthermore the nature of probabilistic suf\003x tree can convert a large number of sequential patterns into a compact model and generate a probability of next movement occurring in the recent sequences Consequently STT can re\002ect the moving behavior of an object in both spatial and temporal feature and its structure associated probability can be a predictor for the future location In light of STT we further propose a STT prediction algorithm to traverse STT for location prediction To evaluate the performance of the proposed location prediction approach we conduct comprehensive experiments The experimental results show that the proposed STT is able to re\002ect an objectês moving behavior and can predict future movements at a speci\003ed time slot ef\003ciently and accurately The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows 1 We propose a Spatial-Temporal Trajectory model STT to capture movement behavior in both spatial and temporal domain for location prediction 2 STT is an ef\003cient compression scheme that converts a large trajectory data into a compact but representative model which reduces the storage size of trajectory patterns compared to association rules proposed 3 We propose a STT Prediction Algorithm that provides accurate predictions 4 The effectiveness and accuracy of our approach has been demonstrated via extensive experiments on real trajectory dataset The rest of the paper is organized as follows Section II discusses related works An overview of the proposed framework is given in Section III Section IV describes the STT construction and the algorithm of location prediction using STT model is shown in Section V Section VI discusses comprehensive experimental evaluations and Section VII concludes the paper II R ELATED W ORKS In the previous works on location prediction Markov chain models have been used to predict the next movement of moving objects 13 14 The whole space is di vided into cells and the Markov transition probability among cells is derived from a set of trajectories Given a current location within a certain cell the next cell is predicted by the transition probability of Markov chain model that captures movement behaviors Furthermore the authors in address the granularity problem of space partitioning scheme In particular the authors utilize density-based clustering techniques to derive frequent regions Then the movements could be referred from cells and frequent regions Thus a prediction model is based

is transformed into a region-based moving sequence Location points that are not in frequent regions will be regarded as noise As such our STT could capture movement behaviors among frequent regions Step 3 STT Model Construction In this step we adopt a probabilistic suf\003x tree with spatial and temporal information to discover movement behaviors Our proposed STT model contains not only transition probabilities among frequent regions referring as spatial feature of STT model but also appearing probabilities within frequent regions referring as temporal feature of STT model In the STT-location prediction module given current movements of an object and a query future time we use STT model as a location predictor and propose a STT-location prediction algorithm to traverse the model and estimate the future location at the query time IV S PATIAL T EMPORAL T RAJECTORY M ODEL C ONSTRUCTION In this section we detail the procedure for frequent regions discovery and transformation of the raw trajectories to regionbased moving sequence Finally we describe the process that how to construct a STT model to capture the moving behavior A Frequent Region Discovery and Trajectory Transformation An objectês trajectory generally is represented as a sequence of spatial-temporal points sampled by positioning sensor or device Let a trajectory of a moving object is represented as T   p 1 p 2   p n   where n is the total number of points and a point p i  l i t i  is donated as a location l i  x i y i  at a timestamp t i 1 003 i 003 n   We cannot directly use such trajectory data for spatial-temporal trajectory model construction The reason is that the object will not repeat exactly the same location in every timestamp of each trajectory even if such a set of trajectories has a similar spatial route Thus we consider a trajectory is a sequence of frequent regions A frequent region is a region where an object often visited For the discovery of frequent regions from an objectês trajectories the density based clustering is adopted by many previous works 5 12 8 In density based approach a cluster is viewed as a frequent region if the number of trajectories visited is larger than a prede\003ned threshold For example we can apply DBSCAN to disco v e r t he clusters i.e frequent regions For each point of a cluster the neighborhood of a given radius i.e Eps  has to contain at least a minimum number of points i.e MinPts  that is the density in the neighborhood has to exceed a prede\003ned threshold However the clusters that detected by DBSCAN cannot be applicable to our STT because the clustering parameters is universal In reality the density of clusters extracted from trajectories varies widely because the speed of a moving object is not always the constant For example the location point density of a trajectory for highway driving is lower than that for local city driving The parameter setting is the constraint of DBSCAN for various density clustering As an example in Figure 3\(a if the Eps value is set to a smaller value some points are classi\003ed as noise and the some information would be missed Using a larger value for Eps causes the granularity problem to represent the trajectory which is shown in Figure 3\(b The key concept of this research is to establish a STT model to capture moving behavior by describing relations between frequent regions The granularity of clusters can affect the explanation of STT considerably Therefore we use grid based clustering to discover the frequent regions The trajectory moving space C is partitioned into k grid cells of the same size Thus each region can be represented as a cell c i with the universal size The density of a cell is computed by taking the number of trajectory segments which pass through the cell A trajectory segment Ts   p i p i 1   where p i is the i th location and 1 003 i<i 1 003 n  is a contiguous sub-trajectory of T We formally de\003ne the frequent region as follows De\002nition 1 A Frequent Region is a grid cell that contains at least MinTs number of trajectory segments passing by the grid cell An example of frequent region discovery is provided in Figure 4\(a where Trajectory1 Trajectory2 and Trajectory3 are trajectories of a moving object passing through a certain space Given MinTs 2  the frequent regions are regions with gray color Note that we use the number of segments passing through the cell instead of the number of points enclosing in a cell to decide that if a cell is a frequent region The reason is the density of points varies with an objectês moving speed that may miss some trajectory information For example the frequent regions c 43 c 41 c 30 are not detected if the minimum number of points is set to 2 in a cell as shown in Figure 4\(b After extracting the frequent regions each raw trajectory is transformed into a sequence of frequent regions Such a sequence is called a region-based moving sequence and de\003ned as following De\002nition 2 A Region-based Moving Sequence moving sequence is a sequence of frequent regions S r    r 1 t 1    r 2 t 2     r n t m   with time constraint t 1 t 2    t m  where  r i t j  indicates the object visits the frequent region r i at timestamp t j  As can be seen in Figure 4\(a three trajectories are transformed into region-based moving sequences   c 16 t 1    c 26 t 2    c 25 t 3    c 35 t 4    c 45 t 5    c 44 t 6    c 43 t 7    c 42 t 8    c 41 t 9    c 31 t 10    c 30 t 11    Figure 5 shows a running example of frequent region discovery and trajectory transformation There are six trajectories of a data set The whole space is partitioned into cells Given a MinTs  a frequent regions is extracted if a cell is passed by MinTs trajectories Finally raw trajectories are transformed into region-based moving sequences B Spatial-Temporal Trajectory Model Construction After trajectories are transformed into region-based moving sequences we construct a spatial-temporal trajectory model to capture moving behavior of an object STT model is a variant of probabilistic suf\003x tree PST is a compact representation

a Raw trajectories b Frequent region detection c Trajectory transformation with time information Fig 5 An example of frequent region detection and trajectory transformation of a variable-order MarKov chain which draws the probability distribution for discrete events occurring in sequences PST can be used to predict the next event by given the preceding subsequence 19 20 21 The original PST only considers the order of sequence in spatial domain but disregard the temporal information For dealing with our location prediction at a speci\003c future time we propose spatial-temporal trajectory model which is an extension of PST Figure 6 shows an example of STT model which builds a STT over a symbol set 002  r 1 r 2   r n   where symbol r i is represented as a frequent region and n is the total number of frequent regions Each edge in the tree is labeled by a frequent region that indicates one movement from one frequent region to the other one Each tree node is labeled by a sequence which represents a path from the node to the root For example a tree node is labeled as r k r 2 r 1 can be located by traversing from the root along the path root 002 r 1 002 r 2 002  002 r k  A predictive table is associated with each node to maintain both spatial and temporal correlation between the region and next movement the spatial probability Pro spatial and the temporal probability Pro temporal  Pro spatial is denoted as the conditional probability P  r k 1  r 1 r 2 r k  of next frequent region r k 1 that follows the label of the tree node r 1 r 2 r k  Pro temporal is represented as transition interval i k 1 and representative timestamps t k 1  The transition interval is de\003ned as vector i k 1  mean sd   where mean is the average transition interval from r k to r k 1 and sd is the standard deviation of transition interval Representative timestamp t k 1 is donated as the representative time when the moving object often passes by r k 1  For example the predictive table of node ab in Figure 6 shows that the next movement region is region c  P  c  ab   6  i c 60  5  8 and t c 9:30  18  00  i.e the conditional probability in the spatial domain that from ab moving to c is 0.6 the object often spends 60 minutes from ab moving to c and the standard deviation is 5.8 minutes and time to pass by c is usually at 9:30 and 18:00 Now we will present how to construct STT model STT construction includes two steps 1 for spatial domain construct a PST to discover the frequent sequential patterns over frequent regions 2 for temporal domain extract transition interval vector and representative time of next movement region for each tree node Before the construction of STT minimal support  denoted as MinSup  is speci\003ed to decide whether a frequent region r k should generate a tree node as a child of a parent node or not At beginning of the 003rst step we hold a STT consisting of a single root node with the counts of each frequent region appearing in the trajectories If the count of frequent region r k is larger than the prede\003ned MinSup  one tree node labeled as r k will be created as a child node of the root Then tree node r k will maintain the conditional probability of the frequent region r k 1 with the pre\003x segment of node r k in the predictive table For each sequence of frequent regions r 1 r 2 r k  if a frequent region r k 1 appears behind it those statistical information of nodes labeled as all suf\003x of r 1 r 2 r k should be updated accordingly After constructing the relationship between frequent regions in spatial feature from historical trajectory dataset the STT construction enters second step to retrieve the temporal information of moving behavior Each predictive table of tree nodes of STT is extended by aggregated with relevant temporal information In this paper the time distribution of a region for a moving object frequently visited is approximately either a single Gaussian distribution or mixture Gaussian distribution Therefore we assume the time distribution of a frequent region can be approximated as a Gaussian mixture model GMM where each component of GMM represents a temporal feature of frequent cluster The determination of the transition interval and representative timestamp of each frequent region can be approached by parameters estimation of the GMM In general the parameters of the GMM model can be extracted by an Expectation-Maximization EM algorithm However EM algorithm for analysis GMM model may result in some drawbacks it does not guarantee completeness due to unfortunate initialization some smaller dense regions may be absorbed by larger and dense regions if they are too close to them In order to extract the temporal feature we build a histogram of the frequency distribution to approach the time distribution of each frequent region Finally we estimate parameters of each component as transition interval vector and representative timestamp The whole process of STT

OCATION P REDICTION U SING STT M ODEL In this section we present how to predict future location using the STT model for a given moving objectês recent movements and query time The STT represents a keyword dictionary of frequent trajectory patterns associated conditional probability entries of each possible next movement The concept of our prediction is to 003nd the best next movement literally We 003rst encode the recent movements into a query sequence Speci\003cally the query sequence s q is a sequence of frequent regions where the object has visited The tree node of STT will be located by the best movement similarity of its labeled pattern and s q  The predictive table associated with the node will decide moving potential of each candidate of next movement in the table The candidate with the highest moving potential will be the next movement region and add into s q  Such prediction procedure will be repeated literally until the query time is reached The last movement is selected as the possible location at query time 1 Movement Similarity The movement similarity is used to measure the similarity of a labeled sequence of a tree node n k of STT and the moving sequence s q  The objective is to search a node of the STT whose labeled sequence is best similar to the moving sequence Intuitively the more recent movements have greater effect on future movements Thus we assign more weights to the frequent region where is closer the query time The movement similarity of a tree node labeled n k and the query sequence s q is de\003ned following MS  n k s q  Size  n k  s q  002 i 1 i 2 003 Size  s q  j 1 j 2 1  where 0 003 MS 003 1 and MS is the longest common suf\003x of n k and s q  For example assume s q  abc and there are the patterns a  b  c  bc and ab in the tree Consider the similarity between abc and those nodes the similarity values are 0.07 0.27 0.64 0.91 and 0.34 respectively The node labeled bc has the best movement similarity with the query sequence abc  2 Moving Potential After the best similar node is located the moving potential of each next movement candidate is calculated to decide the next movement The region with larger spatial probability in the predictive table has the greater chance that an object will move to However such prediction wouldnêt do an effective prediction for a moving object because it only considers the sequential relationship in spatial domain and ignores the effect of temporal domain  For example the probability that a user starts from home to school around 7:00 am is 0.7 and the probability that from home to park around 4:00 pm is 0.3 If the userês recent movements is home at 3:50 pm the answer of location prediction is always school while we consider the spatial domain only However the correct location prediction should be the park Thus by considering both spatial and temporal information the accuracy of location prediction could be enhanced To re\002ect this idea we propose a moving potential that takes both spatial and temporal information into consideration for location prediction For a next movement r k 1 of node n k  the moving potential Pro ST  is measured as following Pro ST  Pro spatial  Pro temporal 2 Pro spatial is computed according to the conditional probabilities of the symbol r k 1 right after the node n k labeled string r 1 r 2 r k in the dataset To take the temporal feature into account for location prediction we have to measure Pro temporal Weusethe Chebyshevês inequality to compute the upper bound of probability of time error as a temporal similarity measurement For a candidate of next movement r k 1 of node n k we estimate the arrival time of next movement t e which is sum of the current time t c and average transition interval mean The minimum difference of t e and the representative time t k 1 of next movement candidates is de\003ned as temporal error  Pro temporal  sd 2  min  t e  t k 1  2 3 For example assume the temporal features of the next movement with node n k are i k 1 5  2 and t k 1   12:00 15:00 17:00   If the current time is 11:52 we evaluate the arrival time of region r k 1 of the moving object is 11:57 because the mean of the transition interval is 5 Minimum error among t k 1 is  11  57  12  00   3 minutes because 12:00 is the closest time to the arrival time Therefore Pro temporal is bound by 0.44 To ensure the sum of probability is 1 we normalize the estimated value and reassign the adjusted value as its temporal probability after estimating the upper bound of probability of time 3 Location Prediction Given a recent movement and query time the algorithm initializes the query sequence by encoding the recent movements into a sequence of frequent regions The tree node of STT with the best movement similarity of its labeled pattern and s q will be located The predictive table associated with the node will decide moving

Fig 6 An example of STT model potential of each candidate of next movement in the table The candidate with the highest moving potential will be the next movement region and add into s q  Such prediction procedure will be repeated literally until the query time is reached Therefore we design a prediction algorithm which is a dynamic programming with time complexity of O  nd  where n is the number of tree nodes and d is the number of time intervals Let F  c t  be the highest probability to reach the next region among the candidates of next node The recursive solution and initial condition is de\003ned as following F  c t  004 1  for t 002 0\(4 max c 002  F  cc 002 t  m c 002   Pro c 002   for t 0\(5  where c is denoted as a query sequence t is traveling time c 002 is one candidate of the next nodes of c and m c 002 is the mean of the transition time between them The sub-problem F  cc 002 t  m c 002   is calculated recursively The initial condition is set F  c t  to 1 for t is too short to go continuously An example is shown in Figure 7 If we want to 003nd the answer of F  c 1  10  we have to calculate F  c 2  5 and F  c 3  5 003rst The value of F  c 1  10 will be set to the maximum probability between F  c 2  5 and F  c 3  5  the value of F  c 3  5 is decided by F  c 7  0  and so on As a result F  c 1  10 is 0  4  The STT prediction processing algorithm follows a general backward recursion procedure of a tabular method and is shown in Algorithm 2 In the beginning we initialize the query sequence with recent movements and locate the node c with best movement similarity with s q  Then the procedure STTprediction c  t q  is used to locate the predicted node c 002 For each problem STT-prediction c  time  with time larger than Algorithm 2  STT Location Prediction Input  query pattern s q  query time t q Output  predicted location Set the best match node c by searching STT corresponding to s q  1 Get predicted node c 002 by calculating STT-Prediction  c  t q  2 Return Location  c 002  3  A backward recursion function function STT-Prediction c time 4 if time 005 0 then 5 Return pattern c  6 else 7 if STT-Prediction c time hasnêt compute then 8 Return Max  STT-Prediction  cc 002  time  mean c 002  Pro c 9 where c 002 003 next c  else 10 Return the computed result 11 end function 12 Fig 7 An example of recursive solution for STT prediction 0 we 003rst check whether it has computed or not If it does not be computed yet we scan all of the candidate next node c 002 of c to 003nd the answer of the problem and return the computed result

VI E XPERIMENTS In this section extensive experiments are performed to evaluate the effectiveness and ef\003ciency of our proposed location prediction method A Experimental Setting In our experiments we use real trajectory dataset from CarWeb which is a t raf 003c data collection platform in which users record their own location every 003ve seconds and upload their trajectories to CarWeb server The trajectories of the users with multiple habitual movements are selected for our experimental dataset The trajectories were obtained by a GPS device of users cars while they were following the traf\003c network in Hsinchu city Taiwan in two moths Since CarWeb is our own platform the ground truth is easy to verify Moreover in order to evaluate the effectiveness and ef\003ciency of our propose method under various conditions we use three trajectory data sets in different kinds of moving behaviors from RunSturday http://www.runsaturday.com which is a website server to collect training paths of sports hobbyists The three data sets are summarized as follows  Walk A walkerês movements were collected about seven months and extracted 24 trajectories The man has two type of walk behaviors walks in the street nearby his home and goes hiking in Pohjois-Savo Ita-Suomi Finland  Run A runnerês movements were collected in two months and extracted 35 trajectories The man has three type of run behaviors runs in the playground nearby his home runs along the urban outer road and runs along the coastline  Bike A bikeês movements were collected in two months and extracted 16 trajectories The data was recorded while the bike went from a start position cruising and back to the start position The movement behaviors at weekdays are different from at weekends in such way that the time periods at weekends is longer than at weekdays Those movement records are almost over a two-hour period The larger datasets are generated by perturbing the original datasets every trajectory is generated with a small  003 5 random value added to the original value The number of trajectories points is 100 20000 20 of trajectories is randomly selected for the test dataset B Prediction Accuracy Comparison In this section there are two sets of experiments are conducted for prediction accuracy evaluation Prediction accuracy is measured by the prediction errors which is de\003ned as

STT-Grid is more precise than STTDBSCAN Note that STT-Grid has very low errors regardless of prediction length while the errors of STT-DBSCAN alterant obviously as the prediction length changes It is because that region cluster discovered by STT-DBSCAN results in various sizes which may cause granularity problem and lose accuracy when the predictive location falls in a big region Furthermore Table

Frequency Module This module aims at detecting the frequent instances and the frequent associations of instances. Indeed, such a frequency depicts an important interest of the user for the concerned instances. Consequently, it is relevant to recommend items with these characteristics to the user 1 considers the profile of the user. It aims at detecting the most important features of interest for the user Regardless of the estimated interest of an instance for a user, we consider that if the user has in his history a significant percentage of items which have as a feature that particular instance, the interest of this instance is significant Unlike the previous computation, this computation ignores the users ratings for the items which have the instance as a feature Example: A user who has watched 80% of the films interpreted by the actor Tom Hanks should get the recommendation of the other 20% he has not seen even if some of the films of Tom Hanks in his history are badly rated 2 case with frequent instances described above, this part of the module deals not only with the profile of the user, but also with the set of items. It aims at discovering frequent associations between the features in the user history. It detects the features that often occur together in order to discover new recommendations. To achieve this, frequent sets of the instances related to the items in the users history are computed. Then, items with such instances are recommended to the user Example: A possible frequent association is the actor Johnny Depp and the director Tim Burton. A user who is interested in these two instances will be recommended the other films related to them E. Recommendation and explanation 


As explained in Sect. II, the collaborative and the semantic modules are in cascade. Consequently, the result is a set of recommendations rec1 which is mixed with the recommendations of the frequency module rec2 such that rec1 is presented before rec2 to the user. This order can be inverted according to user feedback. Concerning the explanation of the recommendations, this is done by highlighting the instances which have highly scored the interest of the user for the items of rec1, and by highlighting the frequent instances in the items of rec2 F. Example In this section, we illustrate the recommendation process for any user u, in the movie domain. We will simplify to preserve the clarity of the example 2010 10th International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications 473 Table I EXTRACT OF THE PROFILE OF THE USER u Film Rating Transformation Psycho 5 Psychol Rear Window 4 Rear Windowl Four Weddings and a Funeral 4 Four Weddings and a Funerall Monty Pythons Life of Brian 5 Monty Pythons Life of Brianl Carrie 3 Carried Stephen Kings The Langoliers 1 Stephen Kings The Langoliersd Pulp Fiction 4 Pulp Fictionl Dr. Strangelove 2 Dr. Strangeloved A Clockwork Orange 1 A Clockwork Oranged Let us consider u who has rated the movies in Tab.

The concerned movies are The Shining and Monty Python and the Holy Grail For The Shining, we obtain the following interest re 


sults conceptInterestActor \(u, TheShining conceptInterestDirector \(u, TheShining conceptInterestWriter \(u, TheShining conceptInterestGenre \(u, TheShining Unlike the prediction of the previous modules, it seems that The Shining is not a good recommendation for u Actually, this film shares its director with Dr. Strangelove and A Clockwork Orange which are negatively rated by u Moreover, it has a writer in common with Carrie and The Langoliers which are also movies disliked by u. The same reasoning is made about the concepts Actor and Genre Concerning Monty Python and the Holy Grail, the interests by concept are conceptInterestActor \(u, HolyGrail conceptInterestDirector \(u, HolyGrail conceptInterestWriter \(u, HolyGrail conceptInterestGenre \(u, HolyGrail This recommendation is a good one. The film shares its actors, writers and director with Monty Pythons Life of Brian which is highly rated by the user. The recommendation is thus justified Figure 3. Extract of the movie ontology Frequency Module: Let us assume that the user rated 60% of Alfred Hitchcocks films \(in Tab. I, Psycho and Rear Window are some of them recommended to u IV. EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION A. Ontology Description For the experimentation, we built the ontology manually see Fig. 3 IMDB8. We focused only on a set of data which led to the concepts Film, Person, Actor, Director, Writer and Genre The connections between these concepts are Each movie is related to a certain number of persons who can be actors, directors or writers but it can also be related to other movies \(Example: Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home and Free Willy 3: The Rescue are related A person and a movie have a genre \(Action, Adventure Animation, Children, Comedy, Crime, etc B. Experimentation and Evaluation 


We use a subset of the dataset provided by MovieLens, the recommender system of GroupLens Research. The dataset contains a set of users, the set of items they have evaluated with a rating between 1 \(for the least liked for the most liked framework, we deal with a set of 86 movies, 934 users and 13 053 ratings. The dataset contains 3593 actors, 77 directors, 275 writers and 17 genres Using a 65% confidence and a 5% support, association rule mining resulted in 1472 rules after running the collaborative module. We evaluated the results obtained from the system by eighteen 20-50-year-old volunteers. The evaluation consisted exclusively in explicit valuations \(ratings 8http://www.imdb.com 474 2010 10th International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications Figure 4. Users evaluation of the system between 1 and 5 rated at the beginning between 11 and 31 films. For each recommended item, the user rates it as liked or disliked. If an item is rated as liked, the recommendation is considered as accurate. Otherwise, the system explains the reason why this item is recommended. The user can then agree with this explanation or not. Explanation of recommendation can be effective in convincing users in their appreciation of the items [24]. In our approach, the explanation aims at discovering if the detected patterns in the recommended item are accurate or not. Let us consider the following explanation in the recommendation of a film: This film may interest you because you frequently watched Tim Burtons films with Johnny Depp. If the user agrees with the explanation, that means that the association \(Tim Burton - Johnny Depp relevant but this particular film do not appeal to the user Otherwise, we consider that the detected association was purely a coincidence. In this case, the system will be able to ignore this pattern for this user in the future The results of this evaluation are depicted on Fig. 4. We can see that 84,9% of the recommendations satisfy the users Concerning the recommendations rated as disliked, 59,4% of the explanations are approved by users. Finally, 93,9% of the recommendations are satisfying or approved An average of 5 recommendations is obtained by running the collaborative and the semantic-based modules \(which is 


acceptable due to the low number of movies  86  in the dataset frequency module. This difference is due to the fact that the cascading modules \(collaborative and semantic-based are limited by the unique usage of the ratings to compute the association rules. The frequency module, on the other hand, is based on a statistical analysis of the item contents Consequently, it does not suffer from the sparsity of the user rating matrix like the previous modules The collaborative module results in some recommendations which are not liked by users. Fortunately, such recommendations are eliminated by the semantic-based module Other recommendations are eliminated by the semanticbased module though they appeal to users. We explain this because the concerned items dont share any features with the ones in the users history. This is why, we aim at introducing a semantic similarity measure to alleviate this problem \(see Sect. V module recommendations and 58,1% of the explanations of the disliked recommendations, satisfy the users. We can conclude that the combination of all the modules results in better recommendations V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In our work, we propose a hybrid recommender system that combines collaborative filtering and semantic analysis of the items. The approach is based on many modules that refine the rules which progressively lead to a recommendation. A process targeting users with various interests is described. First, the collaborative filtering step is achieved using association rule mining which is a flexible way to classify the user. His history is then used to make the results more adapted to him. The semantic module aims at refining the recommendation issued from the rules. Finally, a frequency module is used to discover other items of interest for the user. Using distinct modules allows us to explain the recommendations to the user The results we have obtained from the evaluation experiments are promising. The combination of the collaborative and semantic modules improves the quality of the recommendations and the frequency module adds new ones. 93,9 of the recommendations are satisfying or approved In near future, we aim at defining the approach to learn 


the user profile in order to adapt the combination of the recommendation modules. We also plan to improve the semantic module by defining the semantic similarity between instances [25], [26]. Thus, when computing the interest by instance, those which are semantically similar to the current instance can be used when the instance is not present in the users history This similarity could also be used during the personalization of the association rules. The personalization rule \(a which consists in only keeping the rules which have a body composed of items contained in the users history, can be relaxed if the items violating \(a the items in the users history. The advantage of the semantic similarity is that it can be computed off-line which does not slow down the recommendation process Another improvement we want to introduce is the use of implicit data collected and based on the users behavior e.g. his search history, the time he spent looking at an item and his navigational patterns. This will help to increase the knowledge about the user and, in turn, lead to a better understanding of his expectations Finally, we plan to experiment the framework on other domains to confirm the domain-independence of the system REFERENCES 1] G.
