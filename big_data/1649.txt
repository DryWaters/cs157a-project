Zombies Walk Among Us:\nCross-platform data mining\nfor event monitoring\nEmma L.

However, data mining across multiple social websites\ncan reveal valuable factual information for both monitoring\nand reconstructing events. Crowdsourcing can be used on\nthese sites to monitor ‘?ash mob’ group behaviors, loosely or\nformally planned activities, such as ‘zombie walks’. In certain\ncontexts, these walks are ‘marketed’ to social site users in order\nto promote charitable or social engagements; in others, analysis\nsuggests that participation is a form of political engagement.\nWe use multi-platform information extraction to build an\natlas of geographic and demographic events, which leads us\nto compelling, yet imperfect, understanding of why events\nare successful and regionally relevant factors that encourage\npeople to pick up behaviors or participate in movements. More\ngenerally, this case study con?rms that ‘big-data’-led analysis\nof this kind is reasonably straightforward and rewarding, as\nwell as providing a useful basis for Bayesian reasoning: the use\nof available evidence to evaluate propositions about this type\nof events.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nSocial networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, etc. are\nvaluable repositories of factual information, although they\nare all viewed as repositories of user opinion [1 Trawling\nthrough the social web for information is a risky process\nbecause fact, aspiration and inaccuracy are all present.\nIn this paper, we discuss the use of multi-platform social\nnetwork mining for two purposes: event monitoring and event\nreconstruction. These are de?ned as follows: event monitoring\nis the use of social sensors for real-time event detection [2],\nidenti?cation or characterization, whilst event reconstruction\nis here used to describe the detection, identi?cation and\ncharacterization of events that occurred in the recent or\nhistorical past.\nSocial network mining is a powerful technique. Exploring\nthe evolution of communities and community practice through\nsocial networks is a major research issue in its own right,\nbut information placed on social networks is often intensely\npersonal and indiscriminate mining raises signi?cant ethical\nissues Equally, this means that information placed on social\nnetworks is often removed after a certain period of time,\nas network users move on to other platforms or become\nmore conscious of the implications of privacy concerns. This\nis especially true in cases in which the subject matter is\ncontroversial.\nFor this reason we focus this investigation on a subject\nthat, whilst ?rmly grounded in popular culture, is relatively\nuncontroversial—a group activity, rather than a protest\nmovement. We have, however, chosen a group activity that\nhas a reputation for being coordinated on a local level rather\nthan centrally, on the basis that centrally sponsored activities\nare more likely to be situated in the organizational and\ncultural context of a single region, and are therefore less\nlikely to show signi?cant variation over time. The choice of\nan urban activity with a strong performative aspect, that is\ninformative, making it more likely that extensive coverage\nwould be available on the social web and the activity’s\nprovenance of around a decade meant, as we shall see, that\nit was partially covered by social web resources.\nA. Social networks and ‘socialised communication’\nSome theorists suggest that social networks have removed\nthe boundaries of communication from the mass media that\nhas acted as its backbone in the recent past [3]. This is\nnot uncontroversial. For example, there exists a wealth of\nresearch demonstrating clear interrelations between the mass\nmedia and online behavior [4]. Social networks are also often\ntools for information diffusion—news diffusion in particular—\nand therefore may often be viewed as complementary to\nexisting media distribution rather than a competitive structure.\nNonetheless, there is a well-supported and mature strand\nof research in media that deals with the hypothesis that\n‘increasing the ?ow of news on a topic leads to greater\nacquisition of knowledge about that topic’ [5] for those in\nreceipt of that information.\nOne potential consequence of this perceived decentral-\nisation is an implied increase in frequency of emergent\nbehaviors or activities that do not have a direct precedent in\nthe traditional media. The idea of emergent \(swarm crowd’ is often seen as a science-?ction\n2013 IEEE 13th International Conference on Data Mining Workshops\n978-0-7695-5109-8/13 $31.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/ICDMW.2013.52\n452\nor fantasy trope, or as a political shibboleth. White presents\nan overview of swarm behavior from a law enforcement\nperspective [6 which provides the following de?nition of\nswarming: the unexpected gathering of large numbers of\npeople in particular public locales. Many such events are\norganised events. The term applies in general to decentralised\ngroup activity that typically has a performative aspect. Often\nthe subject matter of a ?ash mob performance is the deadpan\nenactment of a ridiculous scenario—activities typically seen\nas harmless pranks Improv everywhere events, for example,\nhave included Frozen Grand Central, during which hundreds\nof people visit Grand Central Station and ‘freeze’ in place\nsimultaneously, and the yearly and self-explanatory New\nYork 


City-based No Pants Subway Ride [7]. Some may be\nsimpler, such as lightsaber battles in a shopping centre 8].\nThe French apero geant \(giant aperitif living-room to\nthe main city square. The practice attracted the attention of\npolice authorities before largely dying away as a spontaneous\ngathering, with the majority of such events now being planned\nin the knowledge although perhaps not the blessing, of city\nauthorities. However, these ?ash mobs allows a technique\nknown as Crowdsourcing’ to solicit contributions from large\nnumbers of diverse people.\nSocial media in general and Twitter in particular have been\nassociated with various forms of apparently spontaneous\nbehavior. Gore [8 traces the history of the ?ash mob\nto precursors in the 1960s, as well as identifying similar\nconcepts such as Larry Niven’s ?ash crowd. Gore notes that\nit is a concept in ?ux, moving away from an initial de?nition\nas pointless’ performance activity, ‘gratuitous acts of fun’\nto become alternately associated with ‘celebration political\nactivism and commercial advertisement’. Kaulingfreks [9]\ndescribe such activities in positive terms as ‘demonstrating a\nremarkable capacity of self-organisation’, accepting a charac-\nterisation of them as a re?ection of the community un?ltered\nthrough the best intentions of the planner or politician. Such\nactivities share some dependence on technologies with much\nmore sinister manifestations of swarm behavior.\nIn this paper we focus on the zombie ?ash mob, a\nparticularly iconic example of this trend [10]. A ?ash mob\nwith a very specialist dress code, ‘zombie walks’ have\noccurred since 2001, groups of participants lurching through\ncrowded streets in the livery of the living dead. do Vale\ndescribes the zombie walk as a ‘kind of carnival, a reason\nfor people with a cultural universe in common to show their\npower as a mass’ [10].\nZombie walks are typically organised for fun, for charity or\nfor promotional purposes [11]. Their purpose is neither uni-\nformly portrayed nor understood, by participants and audience\nalike; ab initio, the ?rst zombie walks held in Sacramento\nwere conceived as a promotional activity intended to highlight\na midnight ?lm festival focusing on low budget horror movies\n[12]. Many events describe the activity as a charity fundraiser\nor encourage participants to donate food for local food banks.\nIn occasional cases the activity is used for directly political\nprotest, as in a 2011 Wisconsin ‘Zombie Walk against Gov.\nWalker’ organised by local unions. The result does not lack\nfor street theatre; a YouTube video from the event suggests\nthat a popular protest chant ran, ‘What do we want? Brains.\nWhen do we want ‘em? Brains’ [13].\nParticipants in zombie walks of recent years often organise\ntheir activities via social networks and forums. There is,\ntherefore, enough information openly available today to\nbe able to build an atlas of the extent—geographic and\ndemographic—of the ‘infection’.\nII. DATA COLLECTION: PROOF-OF-CONCEPT\nWe have observed a high level of Facebook use in this\narea, so we begin with the Facebook Graph API. Facebook\nitself was launched in early 2004, so it will not contain\ninformation about the earliest years of the phenomenon\nunless that information is in the form of a secondary source\n\(contributed post hoc public resource: pages, events,\ngroups and so on.\nA. Data acquisition: JavaScript Object Notation\nThis functionality is REST-based and returns JSON. A\nsample query to the Graph API is encoded in this way https://\ngraph.facebook.com/search?q=zombie walk&type=page. The\nresulting JSON \(JavaScript Object Notation resembles the\nexample provided in listing 1, providing the name, website,\ndescriptive string, category, number of Facebook ‘likes’ and\nsome additional metadata about the ‘Zombie Walk Argentina’.\nFrom this information it is possible to access the graph node\nof each object type, again via the Graph API, using URLs\nof the form http://graph.facebook.com/ID. For some objects\nthis will also include helpful additional metadata such as\nlocation information and in a few cases even geotags.\n1 {\n2 "data": [\n3 {\n4 "name": "Zombie walk",\n5 category": "Interest",\n6 "id": "112776922070664"\n7 },\n8 {\n9 "name": "Zombie Walk Argentina",\n10 "category Public figure",\n11 "id": "131998566829831"\n12 },\nListing 1. JSON example\nIn this manner, we identify over three hundred Facebook\nobjects dedicated to the subject. Of these, 32 of 339 include\ngeotagging information whilst 115 contain some location\nmetadata, such as an address, partial address or postal code.\nThis information can be geocoded using a geocoding API\n453\nsuch as the Yahoo! Placemaker API, which currently remains\nfreely available but not actively supported. This REST\nAPI will attempt to geocode location strings such as http:\n//query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?q=SELECT * FROM\ngeo.placemaker WHERE documentContent="Knoxville,TN,\nUnited States, 37902" AND documentType="text/html" \(URL\ndecoded for readability parsed,\nor an empty document if it is not. Of 115 objects containing\nlocation information, 95 were successfully geocoded. This,\nhowever, means that the majority of Facebook objects\nremain without geocoding. To remedy this, we use NLTK\nto perform named entity extraction for location information\non the available data including descriptive text and name.\nWe also add a small additional step to provide us with\nadditional information for geocoding the Facebook objects:\nthe collection of a small sample of public information 


about\nindividuals who Facebook-‘liked’ the groups in question,\ntaken again from the Graph API.\nTo complete this task successfully we require a gazetteer\nof location entities. The NLTK corpus provides a small\ngazetteer of country names and a second of cities in the\nUnited States. This means that, for example, it is unable\nto recognise ‘Adelaide, Australia’ as a location unless it is\nappropriately extended. For our purposes we extract these\nlocation entities from Wikipedia to create a free gazetteer\nof larger population centres worldwide Note, however, that\nrecognising a location does not suf?ce for geocoding, as it\nis necessary to resolve any ambiguity that may be present\nby providing the geocoder with relevant contextual data.\nThe assumption made here is that locale information and\nlocation entity identi?cation will together provide suf?cient\ninformation in most cases to identify approximate locales\nwith minimal inaccuracy.\nAppropriate resources to support this task include DBPedia,\na useful resource for rapid mining of structured \(linked GeoNames.org. From Wikipedia\nwe harvest lists of cities and population centres worldwide,\nproducing a gazetteer of around four thousand cities, regions\nand large towns worldwide. These data also include the size\nof urban regions in many cases, allowing us the ability to\nnarrow our search to areas above a certain population size or\nto compare the level of interest in the Facebook page against\nthe population size. In the future, we will be interested in\nascertaining the minimum size of cities capable of sustaining\nplanned activity of this type, and reviewing the relation\nbetween population and evidenced level of interest, if such\na correlation exists, is a useful data point.\nIn practice, the performance of this approach to gazetteer\ndevelopment is acceptable but not ideal, primarily because\nthe geographical locations involved are more extensive than\nour simplifying assumption assumed: that is, it turns out\nthat zombie walks are very popular in Mexico and South\nAmerica in particular, areas which are not extensively covered\nFigure 1. Spatial coverage of Facebook, Orkut and MySpace for the topic\n‘zombie walks’\nin our English-language Wikipedia coverage. Additionally,\nnicknames prove to be a stumbling block in some countries\nor cultures, such as the city of Florianópolis, nicknamed\nFloripa. Additional problems relate to transliteration or text\nencoding dif?culties; for example, Munich, Muenchen and\nMünchen are all synonymous, the second of the three terms\narising from the unavailability of the ‘ü’ glyph or from habit.\nB. Data visualisation: past events\nThe resulting data may be visualised using standard\nmapping approaches in the ?rst instance. In order to provide\na more detailed means of interacting with the data, we\nalso create a GeoRSS feed, which can be displayed using\nGoogle Maps, OpenStreetMap or other compatible mapping\napplications and used for visual inspection in order to identify\nany problems with the data, primarily cases in which the city\nname has been correctly identi?ed, but the wrong instance of\nthat name has been selected, such as London, Ontario versus\nLondon England, or Victoria, Australia versus Victoria,\nBritish Columbia. In this instance, OpenLayers is used to\nmap the data visually and display it in a web browser.\nIII. GLOBAL SOCIAL NETWORKS, LOCAL REACH\nAlthough social networks such as Facebook are typically\nthought of as ubiquitous and global in their reach \(which is\nto a large extent true, although access limitations are imposed\nby some governments upon certain sites such as YouTube\nand Facebook either temporarily or as a matter of permanent\npolicy of speci?c social\nnetworks into speci?c cultures or language communities\nvaries greatly [14]. As the proof-of-concept demonstrated\nthat areas with a lesser dependency on Facebook also have\nan interest in this class of event, we widen our exploration\nto other networks such as MySpace and Orkut.\nA. MySpace\nMySpace offers a similar graph API, again based around\nOpenSocial, although the interface suffers from frequent and\nextended downtimes. Development on the project ceased\nat least temporarily in 2011. This means that the least\n454\nproblematic solution for data extraction from MySpace is at\npresent screen-scraping directly from the HTML.\nAs a result, slightly less structured data is available and our\ndependence upon named entity extraction is somewhat higher.\nMySpace provides a total of 105 group resources, of which\n96 appear relevant MySpace does not have a Facebook-\nsyle ‘like’ mechanism, so group membership is the most\nconvenient available metric for relative popularity.\nThat said, MySpace does provide one additional data\nsource that is very convenient for our purposes: an RSS\nfeed for blogs and announcements associated with MySpace\npages. These provide a useful timeline for participating sites.\nThis blog functionality is used by only 48% of the sites\nidenti?ed as relevant. That said, there is a correlation \(Pearson\ncoef?cient: 0.52 of members that a\ngroup attracts and the number of RSS entries that the site\noffers, so it is a reasonable estimator of site popularity and\ntherefore of the signi?cance of the site as a web property.\nB. Orkut\nWe also collect information from Google’s legacy social\nnetwork, Orkut, which is not well-known in Europe and most\nof the USA. Orkut provides a functional, REST-based social\ngraph API, through which exceptionally well-structured data\ncan be accessed in JSON format. This is in the vast majority\nof cases extremely straightforward to process.\nDue to the fact that the vast majority of the records\nretrieved from Orkut are in Brazilian 


Portuguese and the fact\nthat there is relatively little text \(number of words comparison with Facebook or MySpace\n\(x¯Orkut = 65w, whilst x¯Facebook = 89w and x¯MySpace = 91w not as accessible for text analysis as others explored\nhere. The relative paucity of textual metadata may however,\nbe a direct consequence of the relatively well-structured\nnature of the information—data is present in a structured\nform that might under other circumstances have been included\nin one form or another within the text.\nIV. BEYOND THE SOCIAL NETWORK: SUPPORTING\nEVIDENCE\nHistorians speak of primary and secondary evidence,\ndividing available resources describing past events into\ndocumentation that directly deals with the event itself and\ndocumentation contributed by individuals in the absence of\n?rst-hand knowledge or experience A somewhat analogous\ndistinction may be made to differentiate between the data\nand resources offered by organisers and the documentary\nmaterial uploaded by participants or onlookers to social\ncontent sharing sites such as YouTube, Flickr and Vimeo.\nThese sites may be accessed according to their APIs and\ndata collected accordingly.\nA. Video sharing\nYouTube’s Data API, currently available for several\nplatforms including Python permits searching of all public\ndata and ordering by date. Using this API, it is possible to\nextract the top 500 matches for any search term or query\nset. We use this to search speci?cally for information about\nevents in each of these locations. Having collected this data\nit is possible to establish the coverage of this approach by\ncomparing what we learn from this method against the data\navailable through other news sources Our ?ndings suggest\nthat there are very few video resources available on YouTube\noriginating from years prior to 2007, which ?ts well with\nincreasing availability of video capture on mobile phones\nand point-and-shoot cameras, but is likely as indicative of\nYouTube’s 2005 origins and the pattern of growth of the site,\nas the availability of relevant footage in digital form. Vimeo\nis approximately the same age, dating from November 2004.\nB. Social news websites\nUnfortunately, as with MySpace, the API of the previously\npopular social news website Digg is no longer available. At\npresent, information from previous years does not appear\nto be accessible from the current site. This trend—the\ndestructive overhaul of social websites—is worth noting,\nas it has implications for the study of the Internet and social\nmedia over the longer term. Reddit, however, at present still\noffers an API able to search and retrieve keyword matches;\nusing our knowledge about the relevant date range, locations\nand key terms, we search Reddit for relevant terms. This\nAPI returns data in RSS format, providing us with basic\ninformation about Reddit posts \(title, description and URL provide detailed date information.\nInformation on Reddit sites is usually of the form of a title\nand a small amount of descriptive text \(often containing one\nor more URLs the user is as an aggregator, permitting discovery of and\ndiscussion about resources. Reddit also contains thematic\ncentres, including a subsite dedicated entirely to the zombie\n\(/r/zombies submissions regarding\ngatherings, movies, books, music, theater, speculative science,\nand games featuring the esh \(and/or brain availability of older information\nGiven this limitation it may be attractive to seek additional\ndata sources such as photo sites or similar; however, there are\nalso factors limiting the availability of resources in the longer\nterm from these sites. For example, some sites simply no\nlonger exist. Few sites pre-date the mid-2000s—for example,\nFlickr was created in 2004. Additionally, site policies often\nlimit the public availability of older resources; Flickr permits\nthe last 200 items to be viewed on most user accounts,\nwith exceptions only for those paying a yearly subscription.\nIt could be stated that ‘forgetfulness’ is built into the de\nfacto policy of many such websites. As a consequence, the\nresearcher may be required to look for other sources that\nare able to provide information further into the past than\n455\nthe profusion of ‘Web 2.0’ social media sites, such as news\narchives held by traditional media.\nD. Pipeline for fact extraction from unstructured text\nDue to the limitations of social media/content websites\nand the fact that the trend under study pre-dates these sites\nby up to ?ve years, we need to look more closely at any older\ninformation, for example that held in description metadata.\nUsing NLTK, we construct a multilingual pipeline that is\nable to pick out the date information that is available to us\n\(information extraction nature of\nthe activity and the fact that entries are often multilingual\n\(for example, elements of the description are in English, but\nthe majority of descriptive text is in Spanish, a problem that\noccurs often in the social media context language covered.\nThe unstructured nature of the data presents us with\nsome dif?culty. It is relatively common for ‘boilerplate’ text\nto be copied, often from Wikipedia articles, in order to\npopulate pro?le or event pages with some basic information.\nCommonly appearing strings include some variation on or\ntranslation of the following text: ‘The ?rst zombie mob was\nheld in 2001 in Sacramento, California’. The texts as a whole\nare often written in a mixture of languages and frequently\ndisplay grammatical errors. This is a challenging 


environment\nin which to perform information extraction [15].\nWe select a number of the more common cases identi?ed\nabove, notably those in which the subject associated to the\ninformation is most clearly indicated for example, ‘the tenth\n[location entity] zombie walk’ is clear, whilst the fragment\n‘began in 2001’ is not and develop grammars to extract the\ncases accordingly. We then use them to extrapolate backwards\n\(for example an event that published a note in 2011 that\nstates that it is in its ?fth year is presumed to have occurred in\neach year between 2011 and 2006 or in a more\ntelegraphic style, suffer from a relative paucity of information.\nHowever, the number of false positives resultant from making\nuse of a pure ‘bag of words’ model \(i.e., searching for any\nappearances of a string without regard to sentence context reduces\nfalse-positives, it is evidently vulnerable to misinformation\nand typographical errors. In using this approach it is useful\nto recall that an assertion is not a fact, and seek corroboration\nfrom other sources.\nE Twitter\nIn the case of the ‘zombie apocalypse’, event participants\nuse other social networks, such as Twitter to plan. The\nmajority of tweets on this subject are in Portuguese or\nSpanish, but there are announcements and discussion in\nmany languages as well as event announcements and a large\nnumber of irrelevant uses of the term to describe experiences\nsuch as visiting the market at peak times, walking through a\ncity street at rush-hour and stumbling to the kitchen for a\nmorning coffee. Many of the event announcements do not\nhave a Facebook presence, but more frustratingly, some event\nannouncements often lead to image-based poster ?yers that\nare not readily susceptible to text extraction \(and thus form\na sort of ‘invisible social web near future\nare often signalled by participants’ sayings such as:\nRT: Hoy #Today el zombie walk lima 2012!!!\nMany of these announcements can be parsed for meaning\nusing approaches similar to those used above although it\nis clear that speci?c dif?culties arise due to the ill-formed\nnature of the texts and conventions used; for example, the\ncasual use of multilingual elements, thematic hashtags and\nrelevance or accuracy of content. There is a more signi?cant\ndif?culty with this crowd-sourced data for the purposes of\nstudying activities that have taken place in the past, which\nwe will discuss in greater depth below. Twitter does not\nprovide ready access to information older than a few days.\nSuch information can generally be purchased after the event\nthrough commercial services such as Gnip or DataSift, but\nthis is expensive and may not accurately re?ect what would\nbe extractable from a real-time stream, since this service\ntakes into account post hoc deletion of individual tweets or\naccounts.\nWhere feasible, therefore, one of several approaches for\nharvesting directly from Twitter’s APIs is used. There is\na high-volume API, Twitter’s ‘Firehose’ feed which is a\nchallenge to develop against due to the volume of data as\nwell as, more importantly from the perspective of those\nworking without project funding, expensive. Instead, it is\npossible to freely use the Streaming API. This API introduces\na signi?cant bias in the data [16], with Morstatter reporting\nthat they received 43.5% of the full data available in the\nFirehose during a recent study on the subject, but that the\nStreaming API does not do as good a job as a purely random\nsample of emulating the top hashtags present in the dataset,\nsuggesting that an inbuilt bias of some form is introduced\nby the API’s functionality.\nNonetheless, the availability of the Streaming API and\nthe ease with which it can be accessed by developers makes\nit a useful resource for practical prototyping. We employ\nthe Streaming API to search for relevant terms, collecting\na dataset of approximately 100,000 tweets. This is a small\ndataset by the standards of Twitter analysis.\nV. RESULTS\nSumming across all MySpace, Facebook and Orkut ‘likes’\na total of 631304 is returned. In all probability there is a\nsigni?cant intersection between these groups, making the true\nnumber signi?cantly smaller. It is a fascinating movement but\nit is not a large one, and in this sense it may be more relevant\nto the study of locally organised and executed activities than\ntopics with nationwide or worldwide participation such as\n456\nNamed Entities \(location location location location location location Reddit\nFigure 2. Spatial and temporal coverage of \(from top Reddit for the topic ‘zombie walks’\nthe Occupy movement. A few such events attract nationwide\nnews coverage but most do not.\nA. Comparing coverage across social websites\nFigure 1, an OpenLayers-based visualisation of GeoRSS\nfeeds gathered through the three named sources, demonstrates\nthat spatial coverage is extensive although it is clear that the\ndifferent data sources cover differing areas. Notably, Orkut\nuse is clustered in Latin America—Medeiros [17] states that\n70% of the Orkut users in the world were, as of 2008, located\nin Brazil. A comparison of the spatial coverage of the zombie\nwalk with national wealth provides the expected result \(i.e.,\nareas in which such events occur mostly have a high GDP presents a counter-example\nto this general rule. The fact that such events do not appear\npopular in various 


areas, such as Russia, China, much of the\nMiddle East and \(with exceptions African continent may be attributable to a broad variety\nof possible in?uences, such as cultural differences political\npressure, language barriers, lack of publicity for the concept\nor—most simply of all—the use of other localised social\nnetwork sites, like Orkut, widely used in speci?c areas.\nFor example, a manual search demonstrates that the\n‘?????-???’ \(zombi mob zombi parad having taken place in various\ncities including Moscow, beginning in 2009 1, Omsk in\nAugust of 2012 \(although the permit to do so was withdrawn,\na decision which fed into current events to amplify disquiet\n[18 Novgorod in August of 2011, St Petersburg in\nAugust 2011 and October 2012 [19] with another planned in\nAugust 2013, and so forth. A popular social network used\nfor this purpose appears to be VKontakte.ru, now branded\nunder the vk.ru domain, but there also \(as in other languages such as ?ashmob.ru.\nMedia from these events are visible on YouTube as well as\nsimilar, regionally adapted sites, such as RuTube 2.\nB. Date coverage\nDate coverage is visually displayed in ?g. 2. A small\nnumber of errors in the dataset \(evident outliers arising from\ntypographical errors, such as mistyping ‘2011’ as 2001 text analysis over\ndescriptive text, explaining why dates covered are in some\ncases older than the site itself. The graphs in ?g. 2 lay out the\ncharacteristics of each site; Facebook’s coverage is broadly\ngeographically spread and are in many cases contemporary\n\(at the time of writing both demonstrate\na reduction in usage in recent years, although the decline\nof MySpace is more striking than that of Orkut. As far as\nthe latter two sites are concerned, YouTube’s coverage spans\nis more extensive overall, but both cover a broadly similar\ntime period.\nC. Conceptual variation\nHaving begun as a measure for advertisement purposes,\nthe zombie walk has developed into a number of different\nenvironments which observationally, would seem to have\ndiffering roles within their various environments.\nAcross the United States, Canada, Australia and the UK\nthe concept is closely associated with charity. However, the\nRussian implementation of the concept has been associated\nin the media with protest and discontent. Similarly, it seems\nthat the popularity of the concept in Latin America may be\nlinked to existing tradition. This is supported by relevant\ntheory: Beezley [20] describes historical carnival celebrations\nand activities surrounding the Day of the Dead, and notes that\nsuch events are ‘carried out in public places without of?cial\nsupervision or approval’ [21]. Rosenthal [21] describes a\nstruggle for the use of public space, noting the threat implied\nby public expression of individualism, the disappearance\nof ‘active public space’ from the streets during times of\ndictatorship [22], and by way of contrast, the retaking of the\npublic spaces through street theatre, graf?ti or publicly staged\nsatire. Indeed, Rosenthal [21] suggests that such uses of\npublic space are a constructed tradition, collectively learned\n1http://www.?ash mob.ru/viewtopic.php?f=212&t=9913\n2http://www.rutube.ru\n457\nas a response to political repression. Despite the changing\npolitical landscape, however, these uses of public space have\nnot diminished. Rather, they have expanded in scope and\nvariety—an ongoing process of rede?nition of the use of\nspace.\nThe Brazilian examples by and large do not demonstrate\nthe focus on charity that we see in advertisements for zombie\nwalks in the US and in Australia, although there are rare\nreferences to charity activities. However, several events take\nplace on the ‘dia de Finados’, the Brazilian analog of the\nMexican day of the dead.\nD. A basis for Bayesian inference\nBecause the process of data extraction, particularly from\nunstructured text, is fallible and prone to various types of\nerror, we did not in general ?nd it useful to reason formally\ndirectly over the data extracted. Although much of our data\nresembles open linked data, it is extensive and unveri?ed. The\nlarge quantity of supporting information retrieved from social\ncontent sharing sites such as Vimeo is very useful for this\npurpose, enabling the use of Bayesian statistical reasoning to,\nin effect, establish our level of con?dence in the assertions\nextracted from our initial dataset and to ascertain which\nshould be treated as factual in nature.\nResearchers such as Kaschek [23] characterise information\ntransmission as contingent upon successful negotiation of con-\ntext. Without that joint framework of underlying assumptions,\nwe are at risk of a shortfall in our communication strategy:\nat the very least, a loss of nuance is probable. Our dataset\nsuggests that this is the case in the instance of the zombie\nwalk, since events with that name and that motif share very\nfew other universal characteristics. As Wittgenstein was fond\nof observing: ‘a meaning of a word is a kind of employment\nof it. . . What we learn when the word is incorporated into\nour language That is, our understanding of the term is the\nsum of our understanding of its employment: and a data-led\ncollection of evidence permits us the same advantages.\nE. Susceptibility and infection: understanding participation\nThe zombie walk is the story of an extraordinarily\nsuccessful marketing campaign, an advertising campaign\nthat, so to speak, successfully built itself an afterlife in the\npopular psyche, surviving in the 


form of Saturday afternoon\ncharity activities and Halloween festivities of the Western\nworld and beyond. It is also illustrative of the attention\neconomy, the growth and diminution of audiences and the\nchurn in platforms as site populations develop, change and, in\ncertain cases, falter. Web presences on social platforms offer\nencouragement to users to become involved with the initiative,\nand as such they are examples of grassroots marketing.\nHowever, we should also note that the conceptual shifts\nin evidence may well be the result not \(or not solely sceptical\nauthorities.\nMore broadly, retrospectively gauging the extent and nature\nof any event, but in particular events with decentralised\nelements in planning and development, remains a complex\nproblem, but also an important opportunity to establish a\nbasis for data-driven analysis of the prevalence, spread and\ndrivers of such initiatives. We suggest that this type of\nresearch dovetails closely not only with time-based analysis\nin epidemiology and with predictive mechanisms such as\nKalman ?lter-based prediction of the development of topics\nin social media, but also with interdisciplinary work in\nanthropology such as that of Aral et al. [24]. The in?uence\nof social network users on one another is a well-established\nresearch subject in its own right. The effect of the cultural,\nsocial and legal context in which a concept is expressed is\nequally a subject that has received and continues to receive\nconsiderable interest.\nOne problem with this approach is the need to assemble\na dataset, which, as we have seen, would in an international\nenvironment and over a lengthy time period involve extraction\nof information from a number of websites. This means that\nthe window of opportunity to complete any such research is\nin all probability limited, and that the reproducibility of that\nactivity is limited.\nAnalyzing the big-data collected across all these social\nmedias produces category/ies within which each data item\nthat can be classi?ed with connections in the knowledge\nstructure related concepts. Looking at these knowledge\nstructures and the structural relationship between the existing\nconcepts, the context domain creates an ‘ontology’ [25].\nHowever, the role of social networks in concept classi?cation\nhas shown that variations are weakly visible in the data\nwhen evaluating terminology taken from social websites.\nAlso reaching an agreement about the actual ontological\nrelationships can take many rounds of iterations [26].\nVI. CONCLUSION\nLooking at multiple social networks, we have collected\nlarge amounts of data for the purpose of data analysis. We\nmay choose to evaluate this data either from a philosophical\nor statistical perspective, or through combination of the\nidenti?ed approaches. Therefore we have chosen to use\na Bayesian statistical reasoning technique to evaluate the\nprobability of occurrence and reasoning behind participation\nor staging, for these ?ash events.\nWe conclude that social network-based data collection is\na useful approach for the analysis of ‘long-tail’ phenomena\nwhere the distribution of many values are far from the mean.\nWhilst a longitudinal study would be of bene?t if achievable,\nwe concede that practical limitations will in many cases limit\nresearchers to post-hoc studies. In this instance we suggest\nthat a retrospective cross-sectional approach can usefully be\nsupplemented with additional social data sources in order to\nlimit the impact of noise and to mitigate the effect of small\nsample sizes.\n458\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank Gregory J.

This is because the \ntime in preparation may be very low while the time in space \nmay be very long. If the preparation period will be less than \nseveral weeks then sampling frequency should be ncontinuous or as continuous as feasible . If the preparation \nperiod for launch will occur over many weeks then the \nsampling frequency can be reduced to once/hour. \nIn general, the shorter the preparation time for launch the \nhigher the data sampling frequency is required. Preferably, \nprelaunch activity biological diagnostic data should be \nrecorded continuously and the data available for merging \nwith launch and on-orbit data. After a person initially \narrives in space, the sampling frequency should be \ncontinuous or near continuous . After the person has been in \nspace for several weeks, the sampling frequency can be \nreduced to once/hour. If a person is in space for several \nmonths, the sampling frequency can be reduced to as little \nas once/6 hours . \nTable 2.

CONCLUSION \nA prognostic and health management \(PHM industry telemetry to collect, store and distribute \nto remote locations the biological, diagnostic information \nfor process for predicting mental illness using with \npredictive algorithms .  The predictive algorithms are often \nproprietary and must be developed for use with aerospace \ntelemetry to compensate for the many shortcomings and \ncomplexities of CCSDS telemetry to be accurate and \nreliable. Our proprietary predictive algorithms were \npioneered on the Air Force's GPS satellites and Atlas launch \nvehicles over 30 years ago. They have also been \nsuccessfully used on other military, NASA and commercial \nsatellites, launch vehicles and missiles to illustrate the \npresence of accelerated aging in normal appearing \nequipment telemetry from completely normal behaving \nequipment. \nA behavior of a person ' s  FOFR can explain the cause ntreatment and the cure for mental illness .  The chemicals \n1 8  \nreleased by the FOFR when activated were developed by the \nFOFR to be in the body an extremely short duration. \nToday's  lifestyle has forced people to remain in threatening \nsituations forcing the presence of the toxic chemicals used \nby the FOFR for self preservation to be present for many \nyears at varying levels. The chemicals released by the FOFR \nand release of chemicals that are created as a result of the \nrelease of adrenaline and cortisol cause accelerated aging on \nthe entire body including all areas of the brain. When the \nFOFR is damaged from accelerated aging, it forces the \nbrain 's  chemistry to be altered by changing the ratios of \nthree main chemicals very, causing mental illness .  All the \nmedications used in mental health treat only the symptoms \nof mental illness and do not cure it. \nThe identification of accelerated aging in biological, \ndiagnostic telemetry can be used by ground personnel to \npredict the mental illness in personnel to be used for deep \nspace missions.

specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
