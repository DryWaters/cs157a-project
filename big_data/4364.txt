Fig 3 H  t   W T V  t  Fig 4 V 1   i W i H 0 computing power of GPUs to general purpose computation  CUD A also enables programmers without an y kno wledge about graphic APIs to write C/C code for high performance scientiìc computation by using NVIDIA GPUs However GPU implementation of large-scale RBM faces some difìculties  Memory size  Large number of parameters doesnêt t in limited device memory For example a considerable 4G memory can accommodate up to 1 billion oatingpoint parameters which is of modest size in deep learning problems  Memory transfer  GPU can only operate on data in device memory explicitly or implicitly That means all input has to be copied to device memory before any computation happens and copied back to host after computation ends Due to the limited connection speed of the PCI-E bus memory copy between host and device is usually time consuming for large-scale problems and thus neutralizes the performance gain of GPU computing Our approach use the following techniques to address the two challenges above A Memory Slicing with Minimal Transfer With the fact that large size of mini-batch  l  hurts the overall efìciency of learning as stated in we can assume l<<m,n for typical large-scale RBMs Therefore the weight matrix W m  n dominates the memory storage required in model training and it is also safe to assume device memory is capable to store all other data except W  So our strategy is to split W into slices W i  R m  n  where n   n such that every single slice can t in the device memory and will be copied to GPU as needed for calculations of other variables Speciìcally H 0  as well as H 1  is calculated according to block matrix multiplication rule that each block H i  sigmoid  b  W T i V   as shown in Fig 3 which ignores the sigmoid and sampling for the sake of simplicity We could apply the same trick for V 1 calculation by splitting W in slices W  i  R n  m  and transferring them one by one on demand However we chose an alternative that avoids the undesirable memory transfer of the entire W for the second time Our solution is based on the block matrix multiplication rule as well that V 1  sigmoid  a   i W i H 0 i   In other words a partial result V  i  W i H 0 i is calculated immediately after H 0 i and all V  i s nally add up to V 1  as shown in Fig 4 In this way V 1 calculation is done along with H 0 using the W i s that are already loaded and the second transfer of W is no longer needed Furthermore reusing W i to calculate V 1 eliminates the expensive synchronization of GPU threads since all threads have to wait for the full completion of H 0 if V 1 is calculated by blocks as V 1 i  sigmoid  a  W i H 0   Similarly h 0 and h 1 calculation can also be performed piece by piece with H 0 i and H 1 i calculated After h 1 is updated we can proceed to W i update immediately as  W i    v 0 i h 0 T i  v 1 i h 1 T i  where v  t  i and h  t  i are corresponding pieces of v  t  and h  t  required for updating the current W i  This saves us another transfer of W and nally leads to a twoscan fashion for our CUDA version of CD-1 which we named as cuCD-1  Detail of cuCD-1 is described in Fig 5 1 for all mini-batches V 0 s in training data do 2 Host-to-Device transfer of current mini-batch V 0  3 v 0  row-wise average V 0  4 5 for all slices W i of W do 6 Host-to-Device transfer of W i 7 H 0 i  sigmoid  b  W T i V 0  8 h 0 i  row-wise average H 0 i  9 V  i  W i H 0 i 10 end for 11 12 V 1  sigmoid  a   i V  i  13 v 1  row-wise average V 1  14 15 for all slices W i of W do 16 Host-to-Device transfer of W i 17 H 1 i  sigmoid  b  W T i V 1  18 h 1 i  row-wise average H 1 i  19 W i  W i    v 0 i h 0 T i  v 1 i h 1 T i  20 a i  a i    v 0 i  v 1 i  21 b i  b i    h 0 i  h 1 i  22 Device-to-Host transfer of updated W i 23 end for 24 25 Device-to-Host transfer of updated a and b 26 end for Fig 5 cuCD-1 Algorithm 171 


Fig 6 Stream Concurrency of GPU  oncurrent ecution CuCD-1 enables large-scale RBM training on GPU by memory slicing with a major overhead caused by memory transfers For example update of every W i requires two hostto-device memory transfers for calculation line 6 and 16 in Fig 5 and one device-to-host transfer line 22 for result return GPU simply keeps idling when these memory transfers occur To eliminate this inefìcient idle state recent GPUs of compute capability 2.x or higher allow concurrency of data transfers and kernel executions by using stream which is a sequence of operations that execute in issue-order on GPU In general the concurrency is achieved by launching multiple streams and overlapping CUDA operations in different streams Fig 6 from gi v e s a e xample of stream concurrency that every stream of the total 4 performs CUDA operations in a typical order host-to-device memory copy HD two kernels K and device-to-host memory copy DH Each row is the operation sequence in one stream and operations in one column belongs to different streams that may run concurrently In our algorithm potential concurrency exits in the two for-loops With multiple streams launched and each responsible for a subset of W i s the concurrency may occur in the following cases  Kernel execution in one stream may run concurrently with memory transfer operation in another For example H 0 i calculation kernel line 7 and Host-toDevice transfer of W j line 6  Kernels in different streams may run concurrently as long as the computing resources on GPU allows For example V  i line 9 H 0 j line 7 calculation kernels  Host-to-device and device-to-host memory copies in different streams can be performed concurrently For example Host-to-Device transfer of W i line 16 and Device-to-Host transfer of W j line 22 However this multi-stream approach costs an extra synchronization of streams because each stream calculates individual V  i s and needs to synchronize with each other to produce the summation  i V  i for V 1 calculation Itês too expensive to implement a classic mutex using CUDA events  for e xclusi v ely update of V 1 by each stream In our implementation each stream rst calculates a local sum of all V  i s produced by itself and nally all the local sums add up to V 1  It improves the performance at the cost of extra memory space for local sum in O  s  l  m  bytes where s is the number of streams launched We assume this is affordable because current GPUs only allows up to 16 concurrent kernels  and hence typically s  16  TABLE I Memory Storage

operation parts are performed using the NVIDIA CUDA Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines cuBLAS library W e used random inputs since cuCD-1 mainly focus on memory efìciency and performance A Memory fìciency CuCD-1 removes the device memory size limitation and minimize memory transfer for efìciency Table I lists all the variables stored in device memory and their sizes as well Typically s l are small constants that s l  m n and s l  n   So cuCD-1 works in the memory complexity of O  n  m   Since n  is adjustable depending on s and the total device memory size cuCD-1 is capable of training RBM of extremely large size We rst executed cuCD-1 in a memory efìcient mode to train the testing RBM presented in and compared the performance with the CPU implementation also in which used a highly optimized multi-thread linear algebra package GotoBLAS Since 6 didn t intend to address the lar gescale problem we only pick the largest testing case which is of the size 4096  11008 Although all the parameters of this RBM can t in the device memory of our GPU we forced different memory usage constraints eg keep up to 1/8 of the W in device memory and apply the cuCD-1 for performance test We vary the memory usage for storing W from 1/64 to 1/4 of the entire W with xed number of streams s 4  Table II shows the training time of CPU implementation and cuCD-1 with different memory usage constraints denoted in the rst row eg 1/4 means only up to 1/4 of the weight matrix W can be stored in device memory at any point of cuCD1 execution Same conìguration used in about number of training examples 1 million and mini-batch size 192 is applied for this experiment and rest ones of this section as well The training time of the CPU implementation is taken from which is tested on a Dual-core CPU 3.16GHz CuCD-1 begins to obtain remarkable speed-up 20  ver CPU implementation with only 1/32 memory usage in total and 1/128 for each stream The more we loosen the memory constraint the higher speed-up cuCD-1 achieves eg over 100 when storing 1/4 W in device memory  Performance Trade-off CuCD-1 relies on memory slicing technique requiring a second transfer of W  In addition stream synchronization and scheduling will introduce more overhead All these new features of cuCD-1 may cause lower performance comparing 172

single GPU for training large-scale RBMs and maintains a comparable high performance by leverage concurrency Once the GPU is fully occupied with enough concurrent operations multi-GPU may be necessary to maintain the scalability Even in a multi-GPU framework cuCD-1 is still valuable as it increases the number of parameters every single GPU handles and hence reduce the communication among GPUs Integrating cuCD-1 into multi-GPU framework is exactly one possible direction of future work R EFERENCES  H Larochelle D Erhan A Courville J Ber gstra and Y  Bengio An empirical evaluation of deep architectures on problems with many factors of variation in Proceedings of the 2 th international conference on Machine learning  ser ICML 07 New York NY USA ACM 2007 pp 473Ö480  A Coates A Karpathy  and A Y  Ng Emer gence of object-selecti v e features in unsupervised feature learning in Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 2  P Bartlett F Pereira C Burges L Bottou and K Weinberger Eds 2012 pp 2690Ö2698   Le M Ranzato R Monga M De vin K Chen G Corrado J Dean and A Ng Building high-level features using large scale unsupervised learning in International onference in Machine Learning  2012  A Krizhe vsk y  I Sutsk e v er  and G E Hinton Imagenet Classiìcation with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks in NIPS  2012  J Schmidhuber  Multi-column deep neural netw orks for image classiìcation in Proceedings of the 2 12 I onference on omputer ision and Pattern Recognition PR  ser CVPR 12 Washington DC USA IEEE Computer Society 2012 pp 3642Ö3649  A v ailable http://dl.acm.or g/citation.cfm?id=2354409.2354694  R Raina A Madha v an and A Y  Ng Lar ge-scale deep unsupervised learning using graphics processors in Proceedings of the 26th Annual International onference on Machine Learning  ser ICML 09 New York NY USA ACM 2009 pp 873Ö880  R Uetz and S Behnk e Lar ge-scale object recognition with cudaaccelerated hierarchical neural networks in Intelligent omputing and Intelligent Systems 2  I IS 2  I International onference on  vol 1 2009 pp 536Ö541  Y  LeCun B Boser  J  S  Denk er  D  Henderson R E Ho w ard W Hubbard and L D Jackel Backpropagation applied to handwritten zip code recognition Neural omput  vol 1 no 4 pp 541Ö551 Dec 1989 A v ailable http://dx.doi.or g/10.1162/neco.1989.1.4.541  R M K C M D  V  L  M  Z  M  M  R  A  S  P  T  K  Y  Jeffrey Dean Greg S Corrado and A Y Ng Large Scale Distributed Deep Networks in NIPS  2012  G E Dahl S Member  D  Y u S Member  L  Deng and A Acero Context-dependent pre-trained deep neural networks for large vocabulary speech recognition in I Transactions on Audio Speech and Language Processing  2012  G E Hinton L Deng D Y u  G  E  Dahl A rahman Mohamed N Jaitly A Senior V Vanhoucke P Nguyen T N Sainath and B Kingsbury Deep neural networks for acoustic modeling in speech recognition The shared views of four research groups I Signal Process Mag  vol 29 no 6 pp 82Ö97 2012  D C Cirean U Meier  L  M  Gambardella and J Schmidhuber  Deep Big Simple Neural Nets Excel on Handwritten Digit Recognition Neural omputation  vol abs/1003.0 pp 3207Ö3220 2010  N Lopes B Ribeiro and J Goncalv es Restricted boltzmann machines and deep belief networks on multi-core processors in Neural Networks I NN  The 2 12 International oint onference on  2012 pp 1Ö7  A C B H T  W  D W  B C N Andre w  Deep learning with CO TS HPC systems in IML  2013  G E Hinton and S Osindero  A f ast learning algorithm for deep belief nets Neural omputation  vol 18 p 2006 2006  G E Hinton T raining products of e xperts by minimizing contrasti v e divergence Neural omput  vol 14 no 8 pp 1771Ö1800 Aug 2002  K Swersk y  B Chen B Marlin and N de Freitas  A tutorial on stochastic approximation algorithms for training restricted boltzmann machines and deep belief nets in Information Theory and Applications Workshop ITA  2 1  2010 pp 1Ö10  NVIDIA What is UDA  A v ailable https://developer.nvidia.com/what-cuda  G Hinton A Practical Guide to T raining Restricted Boltzmann Machines Tech Rep 2010 A v ailable http://www.cs.toronto.edu/hinton/absps/guideTR.pdf  NVIDIA UDA Programming uide  A v ailable http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide  S Rennich UDA  Streams and oncurrency  NVIDIA A v ailable http://on-demand.gputechconf.com/gtcexpress/2011/presentations/StreamsAndConcurrencyWebinar.pdf  NVIDIA U LAS Library User uide  v5.0 ed http://docs.nvidia.com/cublas/index.html nVidia Oct 2012 Available http://docs.nvidia.com/cublas/index.html  K Goto and R V a n D e Geijn High-performance implementation of the level-3 blas A M Trans Math Softw  vol 35 no 1 pp 4:1Ö4:14 Jul 2008 A v ailable http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1377603.1377607 174 


D Query Time Performance In each graph the Y-axis is the average time per query in milliseconds Results on both Wiki and Meme are provided in Figure 3 The main trends we observe include i the query time for MB are quite low does not have a change segment ii the query time for MDB is quite high and does not drop signiìcantly with reduction in change segment size iii the query time for MDB-L improves dramatically with a reduction in the change segment size and iv query times for Meme are marginally lower than the query times for Wiki for both MDB and MDB-L  These trends can be explained as follows Query costs for MB are essentially xed since they essentially have to combine the counts from the memory buffer negligible and require typically a page read to access the requisite information from the data segment Query costs for MDB require consolidation of information from the memory buffer negligible and from the change segment expensive  dominated by block level reads and the data segment usually a single page read Query costs for MDB-L require consolidation across the memory buffer negligible the change segment typically requiring a few page reads which are signiìcantly reduced as the size of the change segment is reduced and the data segment usually a single page read This is reîected in our rst experiment shown in Figure 3\(a for MLC-1 in which we varied the change segment while xing the RAM buffer to 5 With regards to the difference between Wiki and Meme query times upon drilling down into the data we nd that on average there are 11.5 more page reads for Wiki This may be an artifact of the linear probing costs within both datasets given the fact that the ratio of number of unique tokens to hash table size is slightly higher for Wiki For the second experiment again on the MLC-1 conìguration we xed the change segment to 12.5 and varied the the RAM buffer for both datasets\(see Figure 3\(b We observe that with an increase in RAM buffer size that  i MB shows a negligible change in average query time ii MDB shows decrease in average query time iii MDB-L shows a signiìcant decrease in average query time performance and iv query times on Meme are typically faster than those on Wiki To explain these trends we should rst note that increasing RAM buffer size has the general effect of reducing the number of stage operations and thus the average size of the amount of useful information within the change segment Thus the time it takes to consolidate the information within the change segment in order to answer the query is on average lower for both MDB and MDB-L For MDB-L the improvement is more marked because fewer page reads are required The explanation for why query times are lower for Meme are similar to what we observed for the previous experiment The third experiment we performed on query time performance was to evaluate the performance of the three SSD conìgurations on the Wiki dataset shown in Figure 3\(c Here the RAM buffer was set to 5 and the Change Segment was set to 12.5 The results are along expected lines in that average query times are slightly better on MLC-2 and SLC over MLC1 for the MDB method The superior read performance for both page level and block level operations are the primary reason This difference is marked in the case of MDB but for both MDB-L and MB the difference is negligible MDB requires a block level read for a query and the performance difference for this type of operation is more pronounced for MLC-2 and SLC over when compared with MLC-1 To conclude we should reiterate that the query performance times we observe here are for our update-intensive query workload where we interleaved queries with inserts averaged over multiple runs In this environment the query time performance of MB is always the fastest For reasonable parametric settings MDB-L typically approaches MB in performance while MDB is always an order of magnitude worse in terms of performance We should note that we also evaluated query times for all three methods in more stable settings few updates/inserts In such a stable setting we found that the query times for all three methods was identical  The query cost essentially boils down to a page read or two on the data segment since the change segment is empty and does not factor Furthermore MDB is bounded by a single block read while the query time of MDB-L may vary However as our results indicate the pointer guided page level accesses of MDB-L provide efìcient read access that outperforms MDB E I/O Performance In this section we examine the I/O performance of the three strategies To ignore the impact of queries in this section our workloads for both datasets simply insert all the tokens or words into their respective hash tables In our rst experiment we report overall I/O cost from the perspective of the SSD for the three SSD conìgurations for both Wiki see Figure 4\(a and Meme see Figure 4\(b The RAM buffer is set to 5 and the change segment is set to 12.5 in this experiment The main trend we observe are that both MDB-L and MDB require comparable yet signiìcantly lower I/O costs than MB  This is primarily attributable to the presence of the change segment which enables sequential MDB-L or semirandom writes MDB  We trade block level operations for page level operations In our analysis of block and page level operations MDB-L had more page level operations and fewer block level operations than MDB due to the linear change segment This gives MDB-L an edge of over MDB  in our deeper analysis we veriìed some of the intuitive ideas of our designs as we increase the size of the change segment we decrease the number of block level merge operations and as we increase the RAM buffer we reduce the number of stage operations Additionally as we shall see shortly MB requires a large number of erasures which also contribute to the overall I/O cost Another trend we observe is that among the SSD conìgurations SLC and MLC-2 offer comparable performance with a slight edge to SLC MLC-1 is quite a bit slower This is primarily attributable to the superior write bandwidth of SLC and MLC-2 Finally we observe that the overall I/O times are higher for Meme over Wiki larger dataset and larger hash table Not shown in our reports are the performance measures for a hash table without the use of a buffer The advantage of this scheme is fast query times because queries are only page level reads on the data segment However results show that such a hash table would induce 1,680,323 cleans for the Wiki dataset and 6,669,932 cleans for the Meme dataset The I/O performance are on the order of 615 times slower on the Wiki dataset and 1500 times slower for the Meme dataset for reported times for the results in Figure 4 This increase is caused by cleaning time and random page writes It is clear that there is a beneìt from our designs Summing up the I/O performance it is fair to say 13 


that for most reasonable parameter settings MDB and MDBL signiìcantly outperform MB in terms of the cost of I/O from the perspective of the ash device Additionally it should be noted that the merging operation within both MDB and MDB-L will happen completely within the SSD allowing for an overlap of CPU operations  not reîected in any of the experiments whereas a merge for MB and staging for the other two methods will require some CPU intervention Also note that an MB merge operation is signiìcantly more expensive than an MDB or MDB-L stage operation random writes versus semi-random/sequential writes F Cleans In our next experiment we take a closer look at the number of clean operations required by these methods for both datasets see Figure 5 Our graphs display the variation of RAM buffer size for both datasets and the variation of change segment size for the Wiki dataset along the Wiki dataset for the X-axis The Y-axis is the amount of erasures The main trends and explanations for these trends are i the number of cleans goes down with increasing RAM buffer sizes since there are fewer stages and merges as shown in Figure 5\(a ii the number of cleans is signiìcantly higher for MB compared to that of the other two methods because the change segment provides an extra level of buffering for MDB and MDB-L as shown in Figure 5\(b iii the number of cleans increases for MDB and MDB-L as we decrease the size of the change segment because the change segment lls more often and thus there are more merges MB does not use the change segment so it stays a constant value and iv the number of cleans for MDB and MDB-L are very similar with MDB-L being slightly better The reduction for MDB-L is clearly attributable to the linear change segment design IV C ONCLUSIONS Hash tables pose a challenge for SSDs because of their random write access patterns Traditional IR algorithms such as TF-IDF rely on hash tables and may suffer under a poor hash table design TF-IDF requires extensive updating of term frequencies Updating an entry inside of a disk hash table may trigger an entire erasure of an SSD block Repeatedly updating a hash table can be detrimental to the limited lifetime of the underlying SSD A simple hash table without buffering can be implemented It has superior query time but it induces a substantial amount of cleans and I/O cost From our experiments we believe that an SSD friendly hash table will have a RAM buffer and a disk based buffer that supports semi-random writes These features will increase the locality of updates and reduce the I/O cost of the hash table for both low and high end SSDs Overall our results reveal that when one accounts for both I/O performance and query performance MDB-L seems to offer the best of both worlds on the workloads we evaluated for reasonable parameter settings of change segment size and RAM buffer size Using MDB-L we observe 1500 times speedup in execution time and over 6 million fewer erasures when compared to a naive implementation In the future we would also like to extend our design to hash functions that do not rely on the mod operator e.g extendible hashing and examine

     Fig 12 Results comparison Planned routes top left Passenger ow comparison of two segments at different frequency top right Opened nightbus routes bottom left Number of delivered passengers at different frequency  R 1 vs R 2  bottom right is motivated by the needs of applying pervasive sensing communication and computing technology for sustainable city development To solve the problem we propose a two-phase approach for night-bus route planning In the rst phase we devise method to identify locations of the candidate bus stops with the passenger pick-ups and drop-offs as inputs In the second phase with the bus route origin destination and candidate bus stops as inputs we develop two heuristic algorithms to automatically generate candidate bus routes and nally we select the best route which expects the maximum number of passengers under the given conditions On a real-world dataset which contains more than 1.57 million passenger delivery trips we compare our proposed candidate bus stop identiìcation method with the popular k means clustering method and show that our method can generate more reasonable and meaningful results We further extensively evaluate our proposed probability based spreading algorithm for automatic bus route generation and validate its effectiveness as well as its superior performance over the heuristic topk spreading algorithm Further more we show the selected night-bus route with our proposed approach is better than a newly started night-bus route-in-service in Hangzhou China This work is among our initial attempts to apply pervasive computing techniques in achieving better urban planning of smart cities With the constraints of the approach and the acquired data this work still has several limitations 1 Human mobility patterns uncovered by taxi GPS traces are biased and incomplete thus the designed bus route might not be the best considering the fact that taxi trafìc does not reîect the whole passenger ow and people taking taxis might not be willing to switch to public transport for various reasons 2 The work makes some assumptions in problem formulation and evaluation for example for bus stop determination we set the walkable distance as 500 meters and the threshold for cluster split and merge is 150 meters apparently the choice of those parameters would affect the results but a study of the parameter sensitivity is not provided due to the space limitation 3 Currently we only explore the issue of designing the best bus route for a given OD pair the proposed approach is still unable to tackle the design of a bus route network In the future we plan to broaden and deepen this work in several directions First we attempt to investigate the optimal bus route design with more real-life assumptions such as varied bus operation frequency and limited bus capacity Second we plan to study the impact of parameter change on the bus route design and the added bus route on the taxi services along the bus route Third we would like to develop practical systems leveraging on taxi GPS traces enabling a series of pervasive smart transportation services A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS We would like to thank the shepherd Dr

15   daily dose equivalents due to GCR exposure is found to be 2.03\32710 4 Sv d 1 and 2.31\32710 4 Sv d 1 respectively. For a wall thickness of 27.0 g cm 2 these values were determined to be 4.27\32710 4 Sv d 1 and 3.56\32710 4 Sv d 1 These results are consistent with the previous results in the sense the build-up from the adjacent modules will act in a similar manner as the increased shielding thickness in the simple cylinder simulations. This build-up effect is less significant for TR exposures. These results demonstrate that in addition to the distribution of shielding within any module, the geometry of the ISS itself also plays an important role. This exercise illustrates the complexity associated with the modelling of the radiation environment inside the ISS 5  S UMMARY  A semi-empirical model has been developed for possible use in radiation mission planning aboard the International Space Station \(ISS\his semi-empirical model is derived from operational data obtained with a tissue equivalent proportional counter \(TEPC\that were collected aboard the ISS from 2001 and 2008 and provides estimates of the TEPC measured operational quantity of dose equivalent due to GCR and TR exposures for a given set of ISS statevectors. The GCR model provides a correlation of the TEPC dose equivalent rate to the effective vertical cutoff rigidity Influences of altitude and localized shielding dependencies on the GCR dose equivalent rate have been shown to be negligible. To account for moderate solar activity, the heliocentric potential parameter U is used to provide a linear interpolation between solar maximum and minimum conditions. The GCR model is valid for all locations inside the ISS. The TR model correlates the mean daily TEPC dose equivalent rate to the mean atmospheric density at the crossing of the South Atlantic Anomaly \(SAA\etric models were developed to specifically provide exposure estimates of the TEPC dose equivalent for all passes over the SAA and including ascending and descending components individually. The TR model is valid for the TEPC located at Zvezda Service Module Panel 327 \(SM327\d for an orientation perpendicular to the ISS velocity vector. The influence of the TEPC detector orientation on the TR dose equivalent was shown to be important. The model has been implemented into a code called ISSCREM and benchmarked against TEPC data not used in the model development. The model has successfully predicted the GCR and TR dose equivalent components to within \26110% and \26120%, respectively over periods of time ranging from daily dose estimates to a cumulative dose estimates collected over many months. A sensitivity analysis on the solar activity inputs used in the predictive models for GCR and TR exposures have demonstrated that the model behaves well given projected solar activity indices In addition to predictions of the dose equivalent, estimates of the protection quantity of effective dose equivalent have been made using the Particle and Heavy Ion Transport Code System \(PHITS\ Ambient-to-effective dose equivalent conversion factors E  H  10\ have been determined for simple and complex representations of the ISS Zvezda Service Module. These conversion factors have been determined for GCR and TR exposures at solar maximum and minimum conditions and for varying wall thicknesses ranging from 5.4 g cm 2 to 27.0 g cm 2 Al. Preliminary results indicate that the TEPC dose equivalent provides a conservative estimate of the protection quantity of effective dose equivalent R EFERENCES  1  Reitz, G., Facius, R., Sandler, H. \223Radiation Protection in Space\224.
