The significance of this concept comes with an ability to establish connectivity among petroleum subsystems. Big data that evolve, from petroleum ecosystems scenarios consist of multidimensional and heterogeneous data instances; modeling and mapping of data instances is a tedious process    In the past decade there has been an explosive growth in the volumes of published petroleum data, as a result of the rapid development and progress of exploration and development projects worldwide The contribution to and organization of such data by the industry\222s professional organizations, national and private oil and gas companies and some major service companies have resulted in a wealth of available big-data  Petroleum ontology PO describes the semantics of all data sources and conceptually analyzed data in the multiple contexts and domains of multiple petroleum systems of sedimentary basins Fig 1 The sheer volume of big-data from Southeast Asian basins makes it hard to find sequences events of petroleum system of interest in each release of heterogeneous databases The data are often distributed as a collection of flat files each containing some textual information the annotation such as basin name  both onshore and offshore oil/gas-field name  and keywords such as names of producing-horizon  and pay-zones and their identifiers The main method of searching for zones of interest in such databases has been using a string-matching program Although this has motivated the development of relational database management systems in the main database centers the databases have continued to be delivered as flat files Ontology based multi-dimensional databases are designed developed and delivered as accurate data views for data mining and interpretation purposes [1   D u r i n g  o r g a n i z a t i o n  o f  the data completeness uniqueness validity integrity and consistency are ensured as per company standards and protocols. Much of the value of petroleum resources is a part of an interconnected network of related databases Many databases 4  a r e  c r o s s r e f e r e n c e d  t o  o t h e r  d a t a b a s e s   o f t e n  through manual entries These cross-references provide the basic platform for more advanced data integration strategies to address the problems including a establishing identity of common concepts b integration of data described in different formats c the resolution of conflicts among different resources d data synchronization data mining fusion and visualization and e interpretation of unified data views for knowledge mapping Furthermore traditional data warehouses may not be able to handle the processing demands posed by big data As a result, a new class of big data technology [7  h a s  e m e r g e d  a n d  is being used in many big data analytics environments. Great attention is needed in designing the metadata structures especially keeping in view the multidimensionality and heterogeneity of data relevant to petroleum ecosystems Authors in recent years emphasize on ontology based multidimensional data warehousing and mining technologies in spite of several products associated with big data analytics NoSQL databases Hadoop and MapReduce are in the market Though these technologies form the core of an open source software framework that supports the processing of large data sets across clustered systems but handling real time spatio978-1-4799-0786-1/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 148   Petroleum industries\222 big data characterize heterogeneity and they are often multidimensional in nature In the recent past, explorers narrate petroleum system, as an ecosystem, in which elements and processes are constantly interacted and communicated each other Exploration is one of the key super-type data dimensions of petroleum ecosystem including seismic dimension exhibiting high degree of heterogeneity sequence identity and structural similarity this is especially the case for elements and processes that are unique to petroleum systems of South East Asia. Existing approaches of petroleum data organizations have limitations in capturing and integrating petroleum systems data An alternative method uses ontologies and does not rely on keywords or similarity metrics. The conceptual framework of petroleum ontology PO\ is to promote reuse of concepts and a set of algebraic operators for querying petroleum ontology instances. This ontology-based finegrained multidimensional data structuring adapts to warehouse metadata modeling The data integration process facilitates to metadata models which are deduced for Indonesian sedimentary basins and is useful for data mining and subsequent data interpretation including geological knowledge mapping  


temporal big-data across multiple geographic locations operations taking place in multiple countries is tedious for integration and time-consuming even for business analysis  II PETROLEUM BIG-DATA INTEGRATION ISSUES   B ig data is a general term used to describe the voluminous amount of petroleum unstructured and semi-structured data often operating companies create  data that would take too much time and cost too much money to load into relational databases Even structured data are not effective to bring out data trends and patterns because of poorly organized data structures and ineffective data integration procedures In addition it is an enormous task acquiring and integrating the datasets in real-time Semantics schematics and syntactic heterogeneities must be addressed during ontology descriptions Unfortunately the semantics of petroleum resource data are often difficult to explain in particular for conceptually analyzed data in which several categories and classifications are interpreted Because of varied degree of change in semantic and contextual contents the interpreted data are not explicitly stated, but are implicitly included in the database design PO much less all geology or petroleum geology science\, is not a single consistent scientific domain but subsumes dozens of interrelated knowledge domains For characterizing and organizing multidimensional metadata structures in warehouse environments ontologies are characteristically used   Fig 1 Petroleum Basins of South East Asia evenly d istributed onshore and offshore areas \(source: [6    This would not be a significant issue if explorers only access data from within a single domain, but that is not usually the case. Typically, explorers require integrated access to data from multiple domains which requires resolving terms that have slightly different meanings across different domains Schematic or structural heterogeneities observed among petroleum system elements and processes from global scale to local scale are handled by schematic ontologies Similarly semantic heterogeneities may have occurred during interpretation of meaning of data-views from multiple sources implying multiple petroleum systems consisting of oil and gas fields or drilled wells or surveys. Syntactic heterogeneities   or differences in formatting styles of data from multiple sources as is the case which occurs with multiple petroleum systems and their data representation are other anomalies addressed during ontology descriptions. This issue is further complicated by the observations that the specific domain whose terminology is being used by the data source is usually not explicitly identified and the terminology evolves over time Geology also demonstrates three challenges for data integration that are common in evolving scientific domains but are not typically found elsewhere The first is the sheer number of available data sources and the inherent heterogeneity of their contents. Some of these sources contain data from a single laboratory or project, whereas others are the definitive repositories 2  f o r  v e r y  s p e c i f i c  t y p e s  o f  information e.g for a specific reservoir class Not only do these sources complicate the concept identification issue previously mentioned because they use highly specialized data semantics but they also make it feasible to incorporate all of them into a consistent repository Second the data formats and data access methods change regularly These changes are an attempt to keep up with the scientific evolution occurring in the domain at large. However, a change in a data source representation can have dramatic impact on systems that integrate multiple sources, at times causing the integration to fail in the new format. Third, the data and related analyses are becoming increasingly complex especially spatiotemporal data such as geological and geophysical G  G data The transformation of voluminous geological data into useful information and valuable knowledge is the challenge of knowledge discovery Identification and interpretation of interesting patterns hidden among trillions of seismic and other exploration big data-points is a critical goal of geoinformatics As demonstrated in Figure 1 in the context of South East Asia hundreds of oil  gas fields possess huge amount of G  G Geology  Geophysics and E  P Exploration & Production\ data. This complicates the goal of identification of useful reservoir structures from variety and multiple petro-geological sequences  III  PETROLEUM DATA MANAGEMNET AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY  The field of geo-informatics plays an increasing role in the study of fundamental geological problems owing to the exponential explosion of sequence and structural information with time There are two major challenging areas in geoinformatics data management and knowledge discovery In order to address these challenges, multiple heterogeneous data are integrated into logical database structures and thus derived metadata range into several scales\227presenting huge analysis for data mining and visualization opportunities. A challenge to data management involves managing and integrating the existing G  G databases However in some situations a single database cannot provide answers to the complex 978-1-4799-0786-1/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 149 


problems of geologists and geophysicists Integrating or assembling information from several databases to solve problems and discovering new knowledge are other major challenges in geo-informatics The transformation of voluminous exploration data into valuable geological knowledge is the challenge of knowledge discovery process Data mining and interpretation of interesting patterns hidden in trillions of seismic and other exploration data are critical goals of geo-informatics The goals cover identification of useful reservoir bearing structures from petroleum ecosystems 5    IV PO FRAMEWORK  A comprehensive framework is discussed in [1  a n d   5   i n  d ifferent petroleum ecosystems scenarios A conceptual framework of PO as discussed in Fig 2 keeps criteria 1 a hierarchical classification of concepts represented as classes from general to specific; \(2\ a list of attributes related to each concept, for each class; \(3\ a set of relations between classes to link concepts in ontology in more information-rich ways than implied by the hierarchy thus promoting reuse of concepts in the ontology; and \(4\ a set of algebraic operators for querying petroleum ontology instances The contexts of PO domains, \(Fig. 2\, depict the overall layered approach for generic PO structure. Three layers are distinguished here  1  R  eal-world data and information sources are considered\227 various proprietary G  G and petroleum engineering data sources including scientific reports company and project documents, and published literature 2  Data elements and models both of inherent data descriptors resulting from patterns in data and formal data models defined by scientists for specialized applications\ possess different formats and the anomalies are addressed by PO syntactic structure These data models represent post analysis information exchange Both human and machine agents that access and analyze the ontology are considered Human agents such as geoscientists interpret and analyze ontology directly using their expertise For machine agents to interpret and analyze ontology, at the same level as human agents, the expertise represents using semantic relationships and articulation rules in an ontology framework, as shown in Fig. 2  V  GENERIC AND DERIVED CONCEPTS OF PO  Our common conceptual model for the internal representation of PO is based on the work done in 4   T h e  authors describe ontologies in the health field domain citing implementation of ontology models in gene technology A similar ontology framework provides a common vocabulary for structured and unstructured information including G  G and E  P practitioners it is a medium to share and access knowledge in petroleum/reservoir-geology domain   Fig. 2: PO general framework modeling heterogeneous data sources Specifically a  PO describes a series of events Fig 2 especially in the context of the petroleum exploration domain that can be used to depict reservoirs in any field or to depict drillable wells. PO describes         P O removes the constraints of potential conflicts arising during conceptualization and interpretations of terms in various data sources and provides a structured vocabulary that integrates all data and knowledge sources in a unified domain There are eight concepts of PO, called generic concepts, which are used \(and reused in different domains and in a broad scale basins  to define complex concepts structure reservoir  source seal chain generation migration timing accumulations linked by  223chains\224 an evolved concept These conceptualized dimensions are typically narrated in hierarchical structure, as demonstrated in Fig. 3. PO specifies different topological relationships among structure  reservoir  and source  in order to illustrate how mandatory semantic constraints are represented Source  and structure  have a mandatory constraint with reservoir  because every structure  trap\ and every source must topologically touch analogues to chain  as derived in Fig 3 one or more instances of a reservoir Producing  oil or gas field must contain at least one reservoir while reservoirs have a mandatory relationship with trap in a producing field  Elements of petroleum system, their constraints and limits may be explored and gathered on the internet through public Web knowledge domains Notice in the Web Ontology Language \(OWL\ representation that minimum cardinality \2231\224 is explicitly represented and is retrieved Instances of chains  Human Agent Geologist 1 Human Agent Geophysicist 2 Workstation machine based\ Agent 1 Workstation machine based\ Agent 2 Semantic based relational petroleum ontology with description of articulation rules/constraints Formal Model 1 Formal Model 2 Inherent Multidimensional Data Model 1 informal Inherent Multidimensional Data Model 2 informal Petroleum Ontology Definitions Geological, Geophysical and Petroleum Engineering Data Sources Scientific Texts, Information and data 001 001 001 Ontology Structures Hierarchical Relational Network Object Oriented Multidimensional MD Cube Vertical Horizontal Lateral 978-1-4799-0786-1/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 150 1 Re  servoir or/ seismic sequence and structure information 2 Structure or /reservoir integration process 3 G & G and geochemical processes of structures, reservoirs and sources 4 Reservoir/ or structural internal and external data associations to petroleum accumulations 5 Constraints affecting the final petroleum trap/s or seal conformation  


of former elements  of PO are defined in the chains  concept Fig 4\. The multidimensional data structure of PO elements is represented as instances of the elemen ts chains  and processes  concepts Defining elements  chains and processes  as individual concepts has the benefit that any special properties or changes affecting a particular element, chain and process, can be easily added to PO    Fig 3 A multidimensional hierarchical structure view - describing dimensions of each system element  If PO concept is tagged to a Total Petroleum System all the details of petroleum system elements, processes and chains are described within that contextualization, conceptualization and specification. Data about binding elements and processes, each in chains are again entered into ontology as their instances Data among elements are chained by the elements-chains concept Similarly data among processes are chained by the process-chains concept Similarly data among elements and processes are chained by elements-processes-chains concepts Chains are conceptually described by their instances  The structure of PO provides concepts necessary to describe individual elements processes and chains Instances of these dimensions are stored either in excel files, ASCII, or in databases in Web ontology language OWL format The complete multidimensional hierarchy of PO is shown in Figs 3 and 4 Another significant feature of representation of the structures is refining the boundaries or limits of system elements or processes  As narrated in Fig 4 the relationships are drawn among elements and processes Several logical rules and constraints applicable for scalability of PO models and multiple levels of information stored in PO models for query information retrieval and presentation, are illustrated in Fig. 5. Data views retrieved from metadata cubes are analyzed for data correlations and patterns. For this purpose, data visualization data fusion and interpretation are used for knowledge discovery    Fig 4 Defining limits and constraints of structure reservoir and source dimensions in a schema, showing design of OWL code multiple dimensions with elements chains and processes presented in a hierarchy in the above figures   VI BIG DATA ANALYSIS  One of the primary goals for examining big data 7  i s  t o  discover repeatable technical and business-data patterns It\222s generally accepted that unstructured data, most of it located in text files, accounts for at least 80% of an organization\222s data If left unmanaged, the sheer volume of unstructured data that\222s generated each year within an enterprise or company can be costly in terms of storage Big data analytics 7  i s  o f t e n  associated with cloud computing because the analysis of large data sets in real-time requires a framework like MapReduce to distribute the work among tens, hundreds or even thousands of computers Big data analytics is the process of examining large amounts of data of a variety of types big data to uncover hidden patterns unknown correlations and other useful information Such information provides competitive advantages over rival organizations and result in business 001 002 MultidimensionalHierarchicalPetroleumOntology TotalPetroleumSystem\(TPS PetroleumSystemDomain ChainsEcosystemDomain SedimentaryBasinDomain PetroleumField FieldRulesConstraints StructureTrapDomains \(Rule ReservoirDomains \(Rule SourceDomains \(Rule SealDomains \(Rule MigrationDomains \(Rule TimingDomain \(Rule Constraints ProcessDomainRulesConstraints 002 002 002 002 002 003 003 003 003 4-WayStructuralClosure FaultGeneratedClosure 001 001 SurfaceExposed 001 001 Constraints PoorQuality ShalingDomain 001 001 001 Carbonates Clastics FracturedShales 001 001 001 003 Shales 001 003 Shales 001 SiltStones ClayStones 001 001 NonSealing 001 003 Constraints Constraints 003 001 PoorSeal StratigraphicTrapDomain \(Rule PoorTrap NoTrap Elements, processes and chains of Petroleum System Multiple Dimensions with hierarchies 001 001 003 ThermalMaturity MudStones LocalSeal PoorlyUnderstood PoorlyUnderstood Quality 001 003 003 003 003 001 001 001 001 001 NoTiming FarDistance CloseToKitchen BeyondTime 001 PoorlyUnderstood 001 001 PetroleumSystemsElements 002 Quantity 001 001 Limestones Coals 001 Constraints 003 Channel OnLap, TopLap, DownLap GenerationDomain 001 OilWindow FavorableTemperature 001 001 001 OIL/GASField Structure Source Reservoir contains seals seals extension hasName hasGeometry Integer string string Reservoir seals seals Instance Instance hasName String hasGeometry String hasName String hasLimit String Volumes Integer hasName String contains instance Reservoir hasGeometry String Reservoir owl:Class rdf:ID="OIL/GASFIELD rdf:subClassOf owl:Restriction owl:valueFrom rdf:resource="#Reservoir owl:minCardinality rdf:datatype="#int">1</owl:minCardinality owl:onProperty owl:ObjectProperty rdf:ID:="contains owl:onProperty owl:Restriction rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#"Thing owl:Class owl:Class rdf:ID="Source rdfs:subClassOf owl:Restriction owl:minCardinality rdf:datatype="#int">1</owl:minCardinality owl:onProperty owl:ObjectProperty rdf:about="#seals owl:onProperty owl:valuesFrom rdf:resource="#Reservoir owl:Restriction rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#"Thing owl:Class 978-1-4799-0786-1/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 151 


benefits such as more effective marketing and increased revenue  Fig. 5 Multidimensional data views from a seismic cube from ontologically described metadata for interpretation and knowledge discovery mining algebra for extracting data views   T he crucial goal of big data analytics is to help operating companies make better technical and business decisions by enabling data scientists and other users to analyze huge volumes of technical and commercial data as well as other data sources that may be left untapped by conventional business intelligence BI programs The other data sources may include Web server logs and Internet clickstream data social media activity reports, mobile-phone call detail records and information captured by sensors. Some people exclusively associate big data and big data analytics [7  w i t h  u n s t r u c t u r e d  data of that sort but consulting firms like Gartner Inc and Forrester Research Inc also consider transactions and other structured data to be valid forms of big data Big data analytics 7  i s  d o n e  w i t h  t h e  s o f t w a r e  t o o l s  commonly used, as part of advanced analytics disciplines such as predictive analytics and data mining But the unstructured data sources used for big data analytics may not fit in traditional data warehouses. Potential pitfalls that can rise with organizations on big data analytics initiatives include a lack of internal analytics skills and the high cost of hiring experienced analytics professionals, plus challenges in integrating Hadoop  systems and data warehouses, although vendors are starting to offer software connectors between those technologies and integrated platforms. Authors proposed various integrated frameworks and as designed and developed in [1  a n d   5   f o r  petroleum industries, use visualization and mining G & G data views for interpretation  A  G  G- DATA MINING AND FUSION  As narrated in an integrated framework [5   o n t o l o g y  b a s e d  multidimensional modeling is done to generate a metadata and accommodate metadata in a warehouse environment As described in Fig.2, integrated frameworks [5  a r e  c o l l a b o r a t e d  to facilitate the data visualization mining and interpretation processes. Data mining in essence, explores data correlations trends and patterns among petroleum heterogeneous metadata Several algorithms are available in the literature [3   o n e  o f  t h e  popular ones is representation of multidimensional data cube and its slicing  and dicing 3    D a t a  f u s i o n  i s  t h e  p r o c e s s  o f  integration of multiple data and knowledge representing the same real-world object into a consistent accurate and interpretable representation Fusion of the data sources multiple dimensions\ yields a classifier superior to any other classifiers based on dimensions and their fusion representations. Data fusion processes are often categorized as low intermediate or high depending on the processing stage at which fusion takes place Low-level data fusion combines several sources of raw data to produce a new arrangement of raw data The expectation is that fused data is more informative and synthetic than the original inputs In a much more complicated application petroleum exploration researchers use \223data fusion\224 to review and display integrated products of exploration and production data with other associated systems 6   O t h e r  e c o s y s t e m s  i n c l u d e  d a t a  acquired from a marine system such as bathymetric in an environment system such as meteorological sea surface temperature \(SST\ and bore-hole temperature are examined to understand petroleum system integration and its ecosystem behavior in reaction to other associated ecosystems Through the use of data fusion all data and attributes are brought together into a single view in which, a more complete picture of the system is created and interpreted for the case of Southeast Asian larger sedimentary basin setting \(examples of data fusion as narrated in Figs 6 and 7 This enables geoscientists to gain new insights on interactions between different petroleum ecosystems. Data fusion is significant, and reservoir-trap presentation have increased understanding of petroleum ecosystem visualization process   Fig. 6: Multidimensional data views for extracting knowledge of a clastic reservoir from integrated metadata In the petroleum systems analysis and knowledge domains data fusion is often synonymous with representation of integrated interpreted data or map-views of multidimensional data views In these applications there is often a need to combine system elements and their datasets into a unified fused\ dataset, in which all the data instances from domains such as seismic  drilled-well  reservoir  drilling  and production  are interlinked and integrated into a single conceptual domain, which could be chains The fused dataset Reservoir Source Structure Seal

is different from a combined superset The data points in the fused data set can contain attribute strengths and magnitudes computed or derived from hypotheses In fact fused metadata may not represent the contextual or conceptual views as that described in the original data. Data instances built with conceptual chains  are preserved in the original fact tables More commonly data warehousing supports the data fusion concept Data warehousing consists of collecting functions providing access to and management of data fusion databases including data retrieval storage archiving compression relational queries and protection Data warehousing for data fusion systems may pose problems because of the large and varied data \(i.e., images, signal data vectors, and textural data\ and the data rates both for ingestion of incoming exploration data, and for rapid retrieval Knowledge based data fusion Interpretation of fused data for G  G interpretations with valid calibrations and assumptions is used to obtain data trends and patterns ensuring good agreement with original data These calibrations are in the form of two-dimensional graphic or map views drawn for Southeast Asian basins Figs 6-8 As modeled using integrated framework described in 5   d a t a  views through OLAP 3  a n d   5    a r e  e x t r a c t e d  f r o m  integrated metadata structures In particular these are extended-form of knowledge-based or expert systems developed to interpret the results of processing analyzing issues such as contexts in which the data the relationships among multiple dimensions hierarchical groupings of targets or objects and predictions of future actions of targets are perceived. Such reasoning is normally performed by analytical solutions but it is approximated by hypotheses wherever necessary  Fig. 7: G & G fusion data mining and visualization    Fig 8 Knowledge discovery from one of the attributed m etadata models  VII CONCLUSIONS B ig data systems that impact petroleum ecosystems management scenario too need an integrated approach for building semantic syntactic and schematic relationships among multidimensional and heterogeneous data sources A common conceptual representation of PO is needed to resolve the heterogeneity among petroleum data sources to enable meaningful data exchange among them Semantic relationships in petroleum ecosystems\222 data are discussed that interpret semantics that are normally not interpreted by annotating systems PO algebra that allows composition of multiple levels of information stored in the ontology for information query and retrieval is discussed PO rules and logic are applicable for worldwide basins PO algebra based on semantic relationships, allows systematic composition that unlike integration is more scalable. Further advantages include reduced time of data search  correct information in one database only, and reduced risk of key business decisions and interpretations being made on incorrect incomplete or nonvalidated data Fine-grained ontologies are effective for mining South East Petroleum Ecosystems data views represented for visualization and fusion are useful for interpretation and knowledge discovery  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT  We are grateful to Schlumberger staff for their critical evaluation and acknowledge for permitting us to present the paper in the IEEE-DEST 2013  REFERENCES  1  S h a s t r i  L  N i m m a g a d d a  a n d  H e i n z  D r e h e r   2 0 1 1   D a t a  w arehousing and mining technologies for adaptability in turbulent resources business  environments Int.

Conclusions for Big Data in Aviation  Big-data transforms operational and commercial problems that were practically unsolvable using discrete data and on-premises hardware  Big data offers new insight into existing data by centralizing data acquisition and consolidation in the cloud and mining data sets efficiently  There is a rich portfolio of information that can feed aviation data analytics  Flight position, schedules, airport/gate, weather and government data sets offer incredible insight into the underlying causes of aviation inefficiency  Excessive size of each set forces analysts to consider cloud based architectures to store, link and mine the underlying information  When structured, validated and linked these data sources become significantly more compelling for applied research than they are individually  Todays cloud based technologies offer a solution CONCLUSIONS 


Conclusions:  Our Approach  masFlights data warehouse and analysis methods provide a valuable example for others attempting to solve cloud based analytics of aviation data sets  masFlights hybrid architecture, consolidating secure data feeds in on-premises server installations and feeding structured data into the cloud for distribution, addresses the unique format, security and scale requirements of the industry  masFlights method is well suited for airline performance review competitive benchmarking, airport operations and schedule design and has demonstrated value in addressing real-world problems in airline and airport operations as well as government applications CONCLUSIONS
