184 A Distributed Multiple Access Technique For Radio Resource Allocation In Unlicensed Wireless ATM LANs Giannis F Marias, and Lazaros Merakos Department of Informatics, University of Athens, TK15784, Tel: +3017257560, Fax: +30172752 14 marias\(iiimnni di uoa Er merakosadi uoa.gr ABSTRACT A distributed multiple access technique for radio resource management is presented The proposed Distributed Dynamic Channel Reservation DDCR method applies to mutlicarrier wireless ATM LANs where base stations act as hubs to offer wireless ATM access to mobile units The method is suitable for unlicensed wireless systems where base stations are installed in 
a common coverage area. According to the proposed approach, base stations compete to access and reserve time on separate frequencies, using a dynamic TDMA/TDD technique combined with listening and competing periods Etiquette rules contention disciplines and medium access control mechanisms are proposed Procedures for terminal association and registration and solutions for the hidden terminal problem are introduced. Finally, the performance of the presented contention disciplines is evaluated and compared through simulations I INTRODUCTION Wireless and mobile ATM wmATM\as an emerging technology is expected to enhance the services offered by cellular networks and by wireless LANs such as IEEE 802.1 1 and HIPERLAN-1\Recently, the FCC has opened a 300 
MHz unlicensed band at the 5GHz spectrum The basic feature of this band is that no company can monopolize a portion of it On the other hand the electromagnetic spectrum is limited Thus efficient methods for the allocation of available frequencies to mobile users or geographical cells remain critical Furthermore under the QoS objectives of ATM carrier allocation methods should be designed meticulously in order to accommodate the established ATM contracts To support wmATM applications Dynamic Channel Allocation \(DCA\seems to be more suitable than Fixed Channel Allocation \(FCA  13 
This paper introduces a Distributed Dynamic Channel Reservation \(DDCR\method, where the unlicensed Base Stations \(BSs\compete and reserve wireless resources in a multicarrier wmATM network based on time demands and taking into account the interference constraints. The Medium Access Control \(MAC\followed by the BSs is based on a dynamic TDMNTDD scheme Each BS after wining a competition, reserves a carrier for a period of time, which depends on its time frame duration 11 SYSTEM ASSUMPTIONS An ATM wireless transport architecture is proposed in  This architecture is based on a multiservice dynamic 0-7803-6465-5100 10.00 0 2000 
IEEE reservation MDR mechanism which uses a dynamic TDMA/TDD MAC scheme Other variations of the dynamic TDMA approach have also been proposed for wmATM systems in  4 5 and 6 This paper takes into account BSs which offer ATM wireless access to Mobile Terminals \(MTs\Each MT maintains an association with one of the BSs until it performs a handover Each BS offers ATM wireless access to the MTs that are associated with it and includes a MAC mechanism for sharing the resources among its associated MTs The wmATM network may be structured or unstructured In the former case all BSs can communicate via terrestrial links and they can use a protocol 
i.e exchange of coded information\to regulate their access to the common wireless resources In unstructured wmATM networks, the BSs can not use a protocol to coordinate their access to the wireless resources In such a case all the BSs should follow a set of rules to compete for the radio resources BSs following etiquette rules are referred to as self organized BSs We assume a multicarrier unstructured wmATM network, where the available spectrum is divided into M carriers We consider N BSs each of which competes for and reserves one of the M carriers at a time i.e single transmitter assumption\All the BSs and MTs 
are slot synchronized, and they use the same slot length. The BSs use a dynamic TDMA/TDD method to schedule downlink BSs to MTs and uplink MTs to BSs connections data during a reservation on one carrier Thus when BSs reserve a carrier they exchange information with their associated MTs based on a single carrier scheduling protocol such as MDR 2 or MASCARA  which attempts to optimize the transmission in one carrier On the other hand, prior to the reservation of a single carrier the BSs follow the DDCR multicarrier scheduling method in order to select the 
most befitting carrier in terms of traffic load to sense this carrier and then to compete for it Thus DDCR attempts to schedule efficiently the traffic load by treating all the slots on all carriers as a two dimensional scheduling problem time and carrier According to the proposed DDCR multicarrier scheduling method the BSs do not have to maintain interfering information about neighbouring BSs in order to regulate access to the shared resources. The approach is adaptive, and the BSs of different providers\select a carrier and compete with other BSs operating in common coverage area Thus, providers do not have to produce interference matrices e.g compatibility matrix 


185 7 and no frequency pre-planing is required. Each BS once it selects a carrier to compete for it dynamically realizes the adjacent or co-channel interfering BSs through signal level measurements obtained during the competition and the sensing periods 111 ETIQUETTE RULES OF DDCR A BS that wins the competition for a carrier it reserves the carrier for a period, which is equal to its current time frame. The winning BS informs its associated MTs that it gained access to the carrier exchanges data with the associated MTs and releases the carrier once the frame period is elapsed Each BS, committed to follow DDCR rules transmits two special signal bursts a the Request Burst Signal RBS which declares the period of time the BS wishes to reserve a carrier and b\the End Burst Signal \(EBS which signals that the BS has terminated the carrier reservation The RBS represents the time period of the frame produced by the competing BS An EBS can be used by any listening BS for the latter to determine that a reservation period of a carrier has finished and a competition period is about to start A The steps of the DDCR process A self-organized BSi follows the steps given below DDCR process 1 BSI selects a carrier say Fc 2 BSI listens to Fc, and if it is reserved by another BS then it waits until it recognizes an EBS, otherwise it goes to step 3 3 If BSi receives an EBS transmitted by another BS or if no other BS uses the carrier Fc, the competition period starts BSI broadcasts its RBS 4 On the completion of the RBS transmission BSi returns to the listening mode on carrier Fc If BSi detects the Fc busy due to transmitted RBSs by other competing BSs it loses the competition for carrier Fc and, thus it should change carrier i.e returns to step 1 Otherwise BSi realises that is the winner and that it could reserve the carrier Fc for the requested period and goes to step 5 5 BSI as a winner reserves the carrier exchanges information with its associated MTs and on the completion of the reservation it transmits the EBS, and then goes to step 1 B Elimination of the hidden terminal problem Due to the frequency reuse characteristic when a BS senses a busy carrier, this carrier could be used by more than one BS simultaneously. Thus, the hidden terminal phenomenon could occur To eliminate this problem, the following rule is added in the third step of the DDCR process: \223When a BS recognizes an EBS it senses the carrier for one more slot If the carrier is still busy it goes to step 1 otherwise it continues with step 3\224 Moreover a BS should sense the selected carrier for two slots in order to realize that it is idle C The carrier selection procedure In step 1 of the DDCR process each BS selects the carrier to compete for it The simplest selection mechanism is Random Choice RC the BS selects randomly one carrier to compete for Another simple mechanism is Round Robin RR Once the BS starts its operation it randomly selects a carrier Fr O4<M to compete for In the next selection, the BS chooses the next carrier i.e Fr+l if r<M-1 or FO otherwise\The RC and RR mechanisms, though simple do not take into account the carrier\222s congestion level that is the number of BSs reserving, or competing for this carrier in a recent period In this paper we introduce a carrier selection mechanism based on the carrier congestion level To estimate the congestion of a carrier we use one more burst the Utilisation Burst Signal UBS This signal denotes the number of BSs which compete or use the carrier during a recent period If a BS has already selected a carrier Fr, it continuously updates the value of UBSi,r The notation UBSi,r denotes the UBS maintained by BSI O4<N for carrier Fr O9cM UBSi,r is updated as follows 1 When BSi selects a carrier Fr it sets UBSi,r=l 2 When BSI realises that Fr is used by another BS or BSs it sets UBSi,r  UBSi,r+l 3 If BSi loses a competition for carrier Fr it sets UBSi,r:= UBSi,r+l 4 If BSi senses an UBSk,r broadcast by another BSk using carrier Fr and if UBSi,r<UBSk,r then it sets UBSi,r:=UBSk,r 5 When a BSi senses a EBS, broadcast by other BSk using the carrier Fr and if it still senses Fr busy during the next time slot it sets UBSi,r  UBSi,r+l A BS which has reserved a carrier broadcasts a UBS after a predefined period of R slots All the BSs understand that the UBS signals are broadcast every R slots If BSi during the nR slot n=1,2,3  uses a carrier Fr it broadcasts the UBSi,r for this carrier otherwise it receives the transmitted UBS The transmission of UBS requires one slot It is possible for BSI listening on a carrier Fr to sense two or more UBS signals which are transmitted simultaneously by two or more BSs using the carrier Fr In such case, the BSi may not be able to receive useful information due to congestion, and it sets UBSi,r:=UBSi,r+2. The value of the obtained UBS is used by BSs during the carrier selection procedure step 1 When choosing a carrier the BS should choose the carrier showing the less congestion. Each BS keeps a Selection Parameters SP list as follows SPi,r=\(CurrentTimei-LastVisitTimei,r 1  0 HM eq 1 BSi at step 1 selects the carrier illustrating the highest SPi,,r value. The CurrentTime factor represents the time a BS takes a carrier selection decision and the LastVisitTimei,r factor represents the last time the BSi was using the carrier Fr The rate of UBS, diminishes in value with time because the UBS represents the congestion on a carrier during a recent time period Thus an ageing threshold is used to represent the uncertainty of the congestion for a carrier visited in the distant past. We introduce the following threshold CurrentTime-LastVisitTimei,r>M*MeanFrameSizei 0 9<M and 0 9<N eq 2 


186  M-1 if  In step 1 BSi checks the time elapsed from the latest time the carrier Fr was used. If this time is greater than the mean frame size of the BSI multiplied by the number of available carriers then the UBSi,r is no longer valid If for a carrier Fr the ageing threshold is exceeded the BSI sets the UBSi,r to a predefined value For the assessment of the ageing criterion simulations were performed, using different predefined values D MT Association Procedures A mechanism that informs the MTs about the carrier selected by their associated BS is essential Thus we introduce a Frame Trailer FT mechanism Each BS when it reserves a carrier and prior to the transmission of the EBS, broadcasts this FT. The FT is received by the associated MTs and includes the next selected carrier Upon reception of the FT, the MTs switch their frequency to the selected carrier On the other hand a BS might select a carrier compete for reservation and lose the competition In this case, the associated MTs should be aware of the next carrier the BS will select To overcome this problem, the BS, before the construction of the FT calculates the SPr parameters produces a carriers visiting list and places this sorted list in the FT The list contains M elements, where the first element indicates the first carrier selected by the BS and the last element represents the carrier that will be selected if the BS continuously loses the competitions for the M-1 carriers Moreover, each BS, that has reserved a carrier broadcasts a key as a unique identifier through the Frame Header \(FH\This key is exchanged between BSs and MTs during the association phase. When a BS and its associated MTs are switched to a carrier and if the BS loses the competition the MTs will receive a FH with a cipher key identifying another BS. Thus they will realise that their associated BS has lost the competition and they will switch to the next carrier of the visiting list E Contention Period DDCR introduces a contention period prior to reservation. During this period each BS broadcast its reservation requests \(through the RBS and realises the reservation requests of its interfering BSs Each contention period comprises of an integer number of slots each of which is divided in a number of minislots The contention discipline is Longest Job First thus the BS that will reserve the carrier is the one with the longest time frame. During the contention period all the BSs sensing the carrier idle will transmit their RBS signals The RBS duration is proportional to the time frame length. Thus each competing BSy having time frame duration equal to TFDy slots will transmit an RBS for g*TFDy minislots The g factor must be selected carefully since g should be greater than the Turn Around Time \(TAT\that is the time required by a BS to switch from transmit to receive mode and vice versa For a BS in order to realise that another BS competing for the same carrier has transmitted a longer RBS on the completion of its own RBS transmission it should switch to receive mode, upon, and sense the RBS transmitted from the latter BS Assume a scenario with three BSs operating in a coverage area as in figure I which illustrates that BSO 7 FH2 MPDU FT2FBS  BS 1 and BS2 interfere mutually. For the purposes of this paradigm assume that M=2 and that BSO is using carrier FO whilst BS1 and BS2 sensing this carriers in order to compete for it when it becomes idle Assume furthermore, that BSO ends its reservation, broadcasts the visiting list to its associated MTs through the FTO trailer transmits the EBSO using the k-3 slot performs the step 1 of the DDCR process and selects carrier FO again, to compete for its reservation BS1 and BS2 sense the carrier FO idle for two consecutive slots k-2 and k-l see figure 2 and realise that they could initiate the competition at slot k On the other hand, during the slot k-2 the BSO switches to receive mode. During the slot k 1 the BSO senses the carrier FO as idle and during the slot k it senses the carrier FO as busy, and, thus it can not participate in the partial contention, which starts at slot k Thus, only BS 1 and BS2 will compete  _ I        A I y  I I  BSO     I I I  I I I 8 I ___ Figure 1 Coverage area for the paradigm Consider that BSI and BS2 have reservation demands TFDl and TFD2 respectively and that TFDl<TFD2 According to this assumption, the BS1 will use, say, the four first minislots of slot k to transmit its RBS 1 and the BS2 will use the five minislots of slot k to transmit its RBS2. During the fifth minislot of slot k BS1 switch to receive state this takes TAT time and realises busy carriers indicating that at least one BS requests larger reservation On the other hand the BS2 ends its RBS transmission on fifth minislot of slot k switch to receive mode at the first minislot of slot k+l this takes TAT time and realizes idle carrier This indicates that the BS2 is the winner of the competition I k-4 I k-3 I k-2 k-l I k I k+ll k+2 I eontmtion  4 slot k  window  slot k+l  I BSI BS2  r RBS Figure 2 Carriers usage before and after contention The BS2 does not uses carrier FO during the k+l slot Instead it waits and broadcasts its MAC PDU Frame Header during slot k+2 This time suspension is essential to keep BSs and MTs slot synchronised 


187 Iv SIMULATION ENVIRONMENT AND RESULTS To evaluate the DDCR performance simulations were performed using the OPNET Simulator 8 In the simulations two parameters were measured a the delay between two consecutive reservations of a BS, and b the utilisation of a carrier Two different classes of frame size were used in the simulations For class 1 the frame sizes are uniformly distributed between 14 and 21 slots For class 2 the frame sizes are uniformly distributed between 34 and 42 slots If a BS wins a competition it reserves the carrier for a time period equal to its frame and at the end of the reservation it sets the frame size equal to zero Then it selects the frame size of the next frame If a BS loses a competition it adds to the frame size the new outcome of the uniform distribution Three different values of the design parameter R were used per class For class 1 the values of R are 20 40 and 60 slots whereas for class 2 the values of R are 50 75, and 100 slots Two different disciplines were introduced and evaluated for a BSi when the ageing threshold for carrier Fr is exceeded 1 The UBSi,r is set to the lowest possible value i.e UBSi,r=0.5 2 The UBSi,r is set to a value that is the lowest among the existing UBSi,k values i.e UBSi,r=min\(UBSi,k k<M At the beginning of the simulations each BS selects randomly the first carrier and initialises the Selection Parameter list with random values To simulate the interference environment we used a static compatibility matrix which specifies if one carrier can be used simultaneously for each pair of BSs To assess the performance of the DDCR method comparisons were made with the Round Robin RR and the Random Selection RC disciplines For the RR and RC approaches the ageing criterion is not applicable The difference between the DDCR method and the RR and RC methods is only the first step of the DDCR process i.e the selection of the next carrier 1 fi Mean Delay Class 1 N=15  211 Carriers i 9 IO 11 12 13 14 15 16 Figure 3 Mean delay for class 1 for RC method and DDCR discipline 1 and 2 methods, when R=60 slots Simulation Results From figures 3 4 5 and 6 it is concluded that the mean delay illustrated when RR and RC methods are used is higher than the mean delay obtained when the DDCR 8 method is used Moreover DDCR gives improved delay results regardless of the ageing discipline or the value of R for both classes Additionally the RR method gives the highest mean delay results and thus this method will not be evaluated further 28 25 22 19 16 13 IO I 8 9 IO 11 12 13 14 15 16 Figure 4 Mean delay for class 2 for RC method and DDCR discipline 1 and 2 methods, when R=75 slots 39 Mean Delay Class 1 N=lS 34 124 9 4 4 t I 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 161 Figure 5 Mean delay for class 1 for RR method and DDCR discipline 1 and 2 methods, when R=40 slots 178 bMean Delay Class 2 N=lS I I Il8 1 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 Figure 6 Mean delay for class 2 for RR method and DDCR discipline 1 and 2 methods, when R=75 slots DDCR discipline 2 attains better delay performance when compared to the discipline 1 This is because for discipline 1 when the ageing threshold is exceeded for a carrier the BS sets the UBS of this carrier to 0.5 which produces a high SP value Thus, the BS always selects the carrier visited in the distant past that is a carrier with uncertain congestion level On the other hand discipline 2 illustrates a balanced selection criteriori since a BS has equal probabilities to choose a carrier that 


188 7 experiences low congestion in the resent period or a carrier illustrating exceeded ageing threshold. The delay improvement factor is given in figure 6 The improvement factor represents the percentage of the delay improvement obtained by the DDCR method when compared to the RC method It is obvious than the improvement percentage is greater for higher values of frame sizes i.e for class 2 Thus it is concluded that the higher the TDMA time frames is the greater the delay performance I  I Caniels I I Figure 6 Delay improvement between DDCR and RC methods for class 1 and 2 During the simulations we observed that the frame sizes produced by the DDCR and the RC methods are about the same Even under this condition the mean delay values obtained by the DDCR methods are smaller Figures 7 and 8 show the mean frame duration for classes 1 and 2 respectively. For class 1 the mean frame duration of the RC method is about 1 slot larger than the DDCR \(discipline 2 frame duration \(Figure 7 For class 2 the mean frame duration of the RC method is about 2 slots larger than the DDCR \(discipline 2 frame duration Figure 8 __ _____ 7 A 221470 r I Mean Frame Sizes Class 2 M=15 r6 O r5 O 44 0 43 0 L I BSs 1 O 141 o 1 I 12 13 14 15 16 Figure 7 Mean frame sizes for class 1 for RC method and DDCR discipline 2 when R=60 slots We have introduced a new comparison factor the Normalised improvement Factor, NIF, which represents the number of slots gain of the DDCR method in respect to frame sizes If MeanDelayRc, MeanFrameSizeRc and MeanDelayDDC MeanFrameSizeDDcR denotes the mean delay and mean frame of the RC and DDCR methods respectively then the NIF factor is defined as 19.5 19.0 Mean Frame Size Class I 12 13 14 15 IC Figure 8 Mean frame sizes for class 2 for RC method and DDCR discipline 2 when R=75 slots MeanDelayRc/MeanFrameSizeRc NIF*\(MeanDelayDDcR/MeanFrameSizeoDcR Figure 9 illustrates the achieved NIF factor According to Figure 9 for class 2 the DDCR method achieves about 6 slots delay gain in comparison with the RC, with respect to the fiame sizes This gain is about 2 slots for class 1 Thus, when the frame duration is increased the DDCR delay gain is increased as well 11 Carriers 9 IO II 12 13 14 15 16 17 Figure 9 NIF for class 1 and 2 Another important parameter is the percentage of idle carrier If this parameter receives large values on a highly competitive system i.e large number of interfering BSs and small number of available carriers then the resources are not effectively used The percentage of idle carrier is shown in figures 10 and 1 1 Idle Carrier Class 1,N=17 35 30 25 10 15 IO 5 0 IO II 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 Figure 10 Percentage of idle carrier for class 1 


189 As shown in figures 10 and 11 the DDCR method obtains better utilisation This gain receives higher importance in respect to the mean frame sizes As previously mentioned the RC mean frame duration is about 1 class 1 or 2 class 2 slots larger than the frame duration of the DDCR method. Thus, the DDCR method spreads more effectively the BSs requests among the available carriers 0 35 0 25 20 15 IO 5 0 Idle Carrier,Class 2 N=17 ___ Carriers 10 II 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 Figure 1 1 Percentage of idle carrier for class 2 V CONCLUDING REMARKS We have introduced a distributed carrier reservation method which applies to interfering BSs competing for reservation in an unlicensed wireless ATM environment The BSs offer wireless access to associated MTs using any dynamic TDMA/TDD mechanism however the proposed method can be easily modified to apply to BSs using a TDMNFDD mechanism. The DDCR method is based on etiquette rules where BSs sense the carrier before they start competing for it A carrier selection criterion was applied, based on congestion information to enable the BSs to choose the carrier that experiences the lowest congestion To assess the performance gain the DDCR method was compared with the RC and RR disciplines. From the obtained results it is concluded that the DDCR method achieves lower reservation delays and higher carrier utilisation than the RR and RC method especially for larger time frame periods i.e load class 2 Our recent simulation results not presented here show that if the DDCR process is combined with carrier congestion estimation and the Delayed Job First contention discipline then the delay stabilises Thus, the DDCR process could be associated with a distributed Wireless Call Admission control \(CAC\function. CAC can take into account the DDCR decisions, determine whether the system is under heavy load conditions, and regulate the admission policy accordingly From the recent results we have also observed that a combination of a Longest Job First and Delayed Job First discipline performs better in terms of delay and carrier utilisation Another critical issue is the stimulation of step 1 of the DDCR process According to the BS triggers the selection of a new carrier a when it looses a competition for a carrier and b upon the completion of its reservation on a carrier approach that is followed in this paper as well Recent study focuses on further conditions for carrier selection For instance, consider a BS that senses idle slot in one carrier and the consecutive slot is sensed busy According to DDCR rules this BS could not participate in the partial contention; thus it could be efficient to trigger a carrier selection procedure The proposed mechanism is immune to topology changes e.g establishment of new BS on a coverage area does not increase power consumption on MTs and finally does not require any kind of frequency preplanning Furthermore in contrast to the approach described in lo the DDCR mechanism imposes no limit to the number of BSs operating on a common area or to the number of neighbouring BSs Moreover BSs of any different dynamic TDMARDD technology 2 4 5 6 can use the DDCR mechanism, when operating on a multichannel system. Another issue is the fairness of the proposed approach From our simulations we have observed that all the BSs with identical traffic loads and equal number of interferers experience similar reservation delay performance VI REFERENCES l V 0 K Li and X Qiu, \223Personal communications systems \(PCS in Proc of the IEEE vol. 83, Sept. \22195 2 D Raychaudhuri and N Wilson 223ATM-based transport architecture for multiservices wireless personal communication networks\224 IEEE J on Select.

Consider the OQL query select x fromExtentX as x where C~.R and   and Cn 5.1 Heuristic H1 Let  Cil   Ci,},Ei  be the maintained con straints and the exceptions of a solution i Only the main tained constraints of the optimization solution should be tested on the objects of the whole extent however all the constraints should be tested on the exception cases and the objects that satisfy the maintained constraints but not the ones omitted should be removed from the result Hence the original query should be converted to the following one select x from Extent2 as x where Cil and   and Ci except Ei If we assume that tests on the query constraints take roughly the same time, the optimal solution is the one with fewest exceptions Ei 5.2 Heuristic H2 Let  Co.Roi Ei  be the index constraint and the corre sponding exceptions of a constraint introduction solution Instead of testing the query constraints C1.~l    C,.R on the entire extent Extent X we apply them only on the re sults of the subquery select x from Extent2 as x 40 where CO.R Since Co.Roi is a constraint on a cluster index attribute, the select operation is expected to be quite fast The original query is transformed to its more efficient form select x from 90 as x where Cl and    and C union Ei The exceptions Ei are merged to the result because they satisfy the query constraints but not the new index con straint Co.Roi Since the union operation is relatively cheap the optimal solution is the one that introduces the index con straint with the highest selectivity 6 Discussion We now look at two different scenarios and estimate the extent to which heuristics H1 and H2 speed up query exe cution The Jirst scenario concerns frequently executed queries Assume that the association rules which are used by algo rithm 3 are not modified We may optimize a query once at compilation time then execute its optimized form It is worth optimizing provided that the execution time of the optimized query is less than the execution time of the orig inal query For heuristic H1 this happens only if the time 132 


saved by omitting some constraints is greater than the time needed to remove the exceptions from the result except operation The more the eliminated constraints and the fewer the exceptions the better the optimization As one of the referees pointed out, the time saved by the elimina tion of constraints is CPU-related Since query execution is dominated by data access time this optimization is not expected to alter performance significantly It would help only in contexts rich in associations with few exceptions in which users express many constraints in their queries Heuristic H2 is expected to bring more significant ben efits Firstly, this optimization involves a union operation which is much cheaper than the except operation used in H1 Secondly instead of retrieving all the objects of an extent from the database we need only look at the subset retrieved through an indexed constraint Hence we save a considerable amount of data access time, spending a negli gible amount of CPU time in evaluating the additional con straint The second scenario concerns queries which are exe cuted only once In this case the time required for opti mization is significant. This time depends on the algorithm that finds associations between relaxed constraints and tight constraints \(see section 3 since this is the most expensive step in the optimization process This algorithm finds paths in a directed graph, and combines the exceptions associated with each edge of the path to derive the total exceptions for the path. Therefore its complexity is a function of i the av erage number of exceptions in the existing association rules and ii the number of different constraints found in the an tecedents and the consequents of the rules We have already implemented the algorithms for apply ing H1 the next step is to implement the corresponding al gorithms for H2 This should not be difficult since the main algorithm  finding associations between rule constraints  is common to the two heuristics We intend to set up an experimental model in order to evaluate H1 and H2 in the scenarios discussed above 7 Conclusion The use of association rules for query optimization is rel evant to both relational and object-oriented database sys tems There has been a lot of research on generating asso ciation rules and maintaining them in the presence of up dates Research has also focused on finding heuristics that take advantage of rules in order to optimize a query Most of this work 2 31 has considered integrity rules rather than association rules with exceptions Semantic optimiza tion heuristics were also applied without considering indi rect associations In this paper we implement algorithms that apply two optimization heuristics presented by Siegel et al taking account of both exceptions and indirect asso ciations We show how to use these heuristics to optimize an OQL query The complexity of the optimization process is closely related to the complexity of the constraint graph which represents the set of association rules in the data It also depends on the number of exceptions associated with each rule We have designed an experimental framework to evaluate the two optimization techniques both in the con text of queries repeated frequently over a period of time, and in the context of ad-hoc queries executed once only The re sults of this experimental work will be presented in a later paper 8 Acknowledgements We are grateful to the anonymous referees who read the paper carefully and critically and made many helpful suggestions Agathoniki Trigoni is supported by a scholar ship from the Greek Scholarships Foundation and is deeply obliged to the National Bank of Greece References I R Agrawal T Imielinski and A Swami Mining asso ciation rules between sets of items in large databases In Proceedings of the 1993 ACM SIGMOD Intl Conference on Management oj data pages 207-2 16 1993 2 U Chakravarthy J Grant and J Minker Logic-based ap proach to semantic query optimization ACM Transactions on Database Systems 15\(2 162-207 1990 3 J Grant, J.Gryz J Minker and L Raschid.
