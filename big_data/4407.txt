Mining Multi-Class datasets using Genetic Relation Algorithm for Rule Reduction Eloy Gonzales Non-Member IEEE  Shingo Mabu Member IEEE  Karla Taboada Member IEEE  Kaoru Shimada Member IEEE  Kotaro Hirasawa Member IEEE Abstract  This paper describes the use of a new evolutionary method named Genetic Relation Algorithm GRA for reducing the number of class association rules extracted by other methods such as Apriori Genetic Network Programming\(GNP  etc The purpose is to generate a small number of class association rules in order to delete irrelevant and redundant rules A reduced rule set has advantages as it provides only useful rules and makes its analysis more efìcient Our approach is based on evaluating the distances between rules for evolving GRA and also evaluating the distances between the data in the test set and the rules for classiìcation Two matching criteria are presented complete match and partial match The classiìcation accuracy obtained by our method is better compared to other reported results in multi-class datasets showing an impressive reduction rate I I NTRODUCTION Data Mining is a technique employed to extract non-trivial information from large datasets Its interest is growing in the research community Association rule mining is one of the interesting research topics in data mining and several methods and techniques have been developed during the last decade However most of the methods for extracting association rules generate so many rules Therefore the problem of selecting the most interesting and useful rules is a research eld that has not been completely solved because of the algorithmic complexity to prune a large number of rules This paper proposes the use of a new evolutionary algorithm named Genetic Relation Algorithm GRA in order to nd and select only the most relevant and important association rules among a big set of them avoiding the redundant and uninteresting rules In this paper the large rule set is generated using the conventional GNP-based mining method 2 Our approach is based on the e v a luation of the distances between rules in every generation during the evolutionary process Two methods for evaluating the distance are presented complete match and partial match The results are evaluated by comparing the classiﬁcation accuracy of the reduced set of rules the complete set of rules and other conventional methods Furthermore it is found from simulations that the proposed method not only reduces the number of rules from a large set of rules but also improves the performance in terms of the classiﬁcation accuracy Authors are with the Graduate School of Information Production and Systems Waseda University Hibikino 2-7 Wakamatsu-ku Kitakyushu Fukuoka 808-0135 Japan phone 81 93 692-5261 fax

removing redundant rules using the concepts of closed item sets 4 and representati v e rules 5 summarization of association rules and a m odiﬁed Apriori-lik e[7 method and visualization techniques However all of them show at most the comparative classiﬁcation accuracy as the complete rule set Zaki et al present a f rame w o rk based on FCI Frequent Close Itemset that reduces number of redundant rules The authors used FCI to form a set of rules and inferred all other association rules from that set Since FCI is used for choosing a set of rules based on the conﬁdence values the number of rules grows as the number of FCI increases Therefore it becomes difﬁcult for end-users to infer other rules when there is a large number of FCI Additionally since this approach uses FCI it may prune some important rules without considering the conﬁdence and support values of those rules Liu et al proposed an algorithm kno wn as multile v e l organization and summarization of discovered rules In this algorithm rules are summarized in a hierarchical order so that end users can browse all the rules at different levels in details However this algorithm only summarizes the rules and redundant rules may still exist in the nal model Similar to all of the above mentioned redundant rule reduction algorithms the main objective of this paper is to eliminate redundant and uninteresting association rules However our proposed method have two distinct features that distinguish it from all other existing algorithms  It uses an evolutionary algorithm named Genetic Relation Algorithm GRA which encodes the association rules in its nodes and genetic operations are carried out as the conventional evolutionary methods  It is not based on any bias assumptions In addition our method evaluates each rule with a set of rules based on their distances in order to nd redundant association rules Hence it eliminates redundant association rules without losing any important knowledge from the resultant rule set III G ENETIC R ELATION A LGORITHM In this section the outline of Genetic Relation Algorithm GRA is described GRA is one of the evolutionary methods for determining the best relations between events The basic structure of GRA is shown in Fig 1 GRA is composed 3 2 4 9 978-14 2 44 29 5 9-2/09/$2 5 00 c  2009 I EEE

stated as follows Let I   A 1 A 2 A l  be a set of attributes also called items over the binary domain  0  1   Let G be a set of transactions where each transaction T is a set of attributes such that T  I  Associated with each transaction is a unique identiﬁer whose set is called TID  A transaction T contains X  a set of some attributes in I  if X  T  An association rule is an implication of the form of X  Y  where X  I  Y  I  and X  Y    X is called antecedent and Y is called consequent of the rule In general a set of attributes is called an itemset or pattern More concisely an itemset is a non-empty subset of I  Each itemset has an associated measure of statistical signiﬁcance called support If the fraction of transactions containing X in G equals t  then support  X  t Therule X  Y has a measure of its strength called conﬁdence deﬁned as the ratio of support  X  Y  support  X  This measure indicates the relative frequency of the rule that is the frequency with which the consequent is fulﬁlled when the antecedent is also fulﬁlled  A class association rule is deﬁned to be an implication with a class being its consequent B GRA for association rules with non-ﬁxed consequent For association rules with non-ﬁxed consequent GRA with directed branches are used Fig 5 shows an example of GRA for association rules with non-ﬁxed consequent In Fig 5 the antecedent and the consequent of each rule are represented as nodes in GRA The conﬁdence of each rule is used as the strength for example The genotype of the GRA in the example of Fig 5 is described in Table I Fig 5 Genetic Relation Algorithm for association rules with non-ﬁxed consequent TABLE I Genotype of GRA for association rules with nonﬁxed consequent  NodeID N odeF unction C 1 C 2 S 1 S 2 1 A 2 3 0.9 0.3 2 BC 3 0.8 3 K 2 4 0.7 0.4 4 M 1 0.6 C GRA for association rules with xed consequent Association rules with xed consequent are mainly used for classiﬁcation GRA with indirected branches are used for association rules with xed consequent Fig 6 shows an example of GRA for association rules with xed consequent In Fig 6 the antecedent of each rule is represented as the node in GRA The distance between the nodes is used as the strength The genotype of the GRA in the example of Fig 6 is described in Table II TABLE II Genotype of GRA for association rules with xed consequent NodeID N odeF unction C 1 C 2 C 3 S 1 S 2 S 3 1 AB 2 3 4 1.5 1.8 2.5 2 ABC 1 3 4 1.5 2.6 3.2 3 B 1 2 4 1.8 2.6 2.7 4 SK 1 2 3 2.5 3.2 2.7 Fig 6 Genetic Relation Algorithm for association rules with xed consequent D Distance between rules The distance between the rules in the same class is deﬁned in this sub-section in order to realize GRA with xed consequent supposing we are dealing with the classiﬁcation problems Two types of distances are presented complete match and partial match 1 Distance using complete match The distance between rule i and rule j denoted by D  i j  is deﬁned as follows D  i j  support  i  support  j   2 support  i j   1 where support  i  is the support of rule i  support  j  is the support of rule j  and support  i j  is the support of rule i and rule j  The distance expresses the ratio of the number of records with the same class in the database where the matching between rule i and the data and the matching between rule j and the data do not coincide 2009 I EEE C o ng re ss o nEv o luti o na r yC o mputati o n  CEC 2009 3 2 5 1 


As an example consider Table III and the following rule i and rule j  TABLE III Example of record data  TID A B C D E F Class 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 c 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 c 3 1 0 0 0 1 1 c 4 0 0 1 1 0 1 c 5 1 1 0 0 1 1 c rule i  ABE  c rule j  CDF  c The distance D  i j  between rule i and rule j is calculated as follows The support of rule i is 3/5 that is tuple 1 2 and 5 match rule i  The support of rule j is 2/5 that is tuple 2 and 4 match rule j  The support of both rules is 1/5 that is tuple 2 matches rule i and rule j  Therefore the distance is calculated as D  i j 3  5  2  5  2\(1  5  3  5 2 Distance using partial match The distance between rule i and rule j using partial match is realized considering the partial match between rules and data and it is deﬁned as follows D  i j   d  D  D  d i   D  d j    D   2 0 012 D  i j  012 1  0 where D  d i   r di r i  r di is the number of attributes in the antecedent of rule i which match data d  r i is the number of attributes in the antecedent of rules i and D is the set of data The deﬁnition of the partial match includes the deﬁnition of the complete match as a special case E Fitness of GRA The tness function of each GRA individual is deﬁned as follows Fitness  1  R   i  R 1  R  i    j  R  i  D  i j   3 where D  i j  is the distance between rule i and rule j described in Section IV-D R is the set of sufﬁxes of rules in GRA and R  i  is the set of sufﬁxes of rules whose distance is deﬁned between node i in GRA The tness function evaluates the GRA individuals so that the distances between rules are maximized It is our interest to nd class association rules far away each other as much as possible because that means the rules are not similar Therefore the tness function eliminates the rules near each other as they are redundant or irrelevant F Genetic Operators In order to nd really important class association rules the function of the nodes in GRA should be changed It is possible to realize the above effectively by GRA genetic operations because mutation and crossover will change the connections or contents of the nodes Three kinds of genetic operators are used crossover mutation-1 change the connection of nodes and mutation-2 change the function of nodes In each generation all of the individuals in the population are ranked by their tnesses and the best individual is preserved for the next generation Then tournament selection of individuals is carried out for reproduction for the next generation Finally the individuals are generated by crossover and mutation These operators are executed for the gene of the nodes of GRA This procedure is demonstrated using 240 individuals at each generation 80 individuals are selected from the population by tournament selection and their genes are exchanged by crossover Then 80 individuals are also selected from the population and their genes are changed by mutation-1 Finally 79 individuals are also selected from the population and their genes are changed by mutation-2 Therefore the 239 new individuals generated by crossover mutation-1 and mutation-2 and one elite individual form the next population  Selection Elite selection is used in order to preserve the best individual in the current generation for the next generation  Crossover Uniform crossover is used Two parent individuals are selected by tournament selection twice for reproduction Nodes are selected as the crossover nodes with the probability of P c  Two parents exchange the gene of the corresponding crossover nodes The new individuals generated are the new ones in the next population  Mutation-1 Mutation-1 operator affects one individual One parent individual is selected by tournament selection for reproduction The connection of the nodes is changed randomly by mutation rate of P m 1  The parent individual in mutation-1 reproduces a new offspring and it becomes the new one for the next generation  Mutation-2 Mutation-2 operator also affects one individual One parent individual is selected by tournament selection for reproduction This operator changes the functions of the nodes by mutation rate P m 2 New offspring is reproduced from the parent individual by mutation-2 and becomes the new one for the next generation G Flowchart of GRA Fig.7 shows the owchart of GRA The initialization of GRA is carried out using the class association rules generated by GNP and stored in the pool That is for the rst GRA population each individual is generated assigning the antecedent of a certain class association rule selected 3 2 5 2 2009 I EEE C o ng re ss o nEv o luti o na r yC o mputati o n  CEC 2009 


randomly to one of the nodes of GRA randomly It is ensured that all nodes within one individual are different The evaluation of the individuals is carried out according to their tness values Then reproduction of the individuals is carried out using the selection and genetic operations in order to generate a population for the next generation This process is repeated until the last generation Fig 7 Flowchart of Genetic Relation Algorithm H Classiﬁcation using the rules obtained by GRA In our proposed method i.e the classiﬁcation by selecting a small number of really important class association rules using GRA is evaluated in terms of classiﬁcation accuracy Two classiﬁcation methodologies are described using complete match and partial match 1 Classiﬁer using complete match This classiﬁcation methodology is proposed in  and described as follo ws 1 R Z  Calculate the set of sufﬁxes of rules in class Z  Z 0  1  2 K   2 score Z  d   Compute the number of rules in class Z in the classiﬁer whose antecedent matches data d completely 3 m Z  d   score Z  d    R Z   Predict in such a way that data d belong to the class having the lowest m Z  d   2 Classiﬁer using partial match The classiﬁcation is done by comparing the average distances from the test data to the rules of each class as shown in Fig 8 This is an extension of the complete match method The classiﬁer is described as follows 1 R Z  Calculate the set of sufﬁxes of rules in class Z  Z 0  1  2 K   2 m Z  d   Compute the average distance between data d and the rules in class Z m Z  d  1  R Z   i  R Z D Z  d i   4 where D Z  d i  is the distance between data d and rule i in class Z  which is calculated by the following D Z  d i   r di  Z  r i  Z   5 where r di  Z  is the number of attributes in the antecedent of rule i in class Z which match data d r i  Z  is the number of attributes in the antecedent of rule i in class Z 3 Predict in such a way that data d belongs to the class having the lowest m Z  d   That is data d belongs to the closest class Fig 8 Classiﬁcation of data d V E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS Two datasets from UCI ML Repository were tak e n to conduct the experiments Lymphography and Vehicle datasets Lymphography is a medical dataset that contains the information about primary tumor It contains 18 attributes 148 records and 4 classes Vehicle dataset is an image dataset that contains the information about the features of the silhouette of different types of cars The purpose is to classify a given silhouette as one of four types of vehicles This database contains 846 records 18 attributes and 4 classes The original datasets are discretized using a supervised discretization method and the WEKA software According to this procedure 1 Replace missing values with the most frequent values or means for nominal or numeric attributes respectively 2 Discretize continuous attributes into nominal ones using 2009 I EEE C o ng re ss o nEv o luti o na r yC o mputati o n  CEC 2009 3 2 53
