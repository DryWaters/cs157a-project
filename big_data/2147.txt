In this algorithm, using the linear programming model to get the assigned task number for each node, then considered the computing and bandwidth of the node in the model and in an integrated manner to assign task for node. For each non-leaf node, we make the following deal when a son node requests task from the father node, first checkout whether it can accept more task, if yes, assign a task to it; when more than one nodes request task, checkout their task number and select the best node to assign a task to it Because bandwidth has a greater impact on task scheduling than computing power [5 s o w h e n se l e c t  t h e be st nod e w e  adopt the following strategy: first, compare the bandwidth between the son nodes, if they have the same bandwidth then select the node which computing power is more strong, else select the node which bandwidth is more wide.

SimGrid offers a series of core functions to create and simulate the heterogeneous distributed environment 7 so it’s suitable for simulating the independent task scheduling algorithm in the grid environment For example, The optimal solution of the model in the Fig.3 is x 0 x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 2, 2, 2, 1, 1}, the task scheduling is shown in Figure 4  Figure 4. The  optimal solution task scheduling The level of the solid line with arrows indicate the execute time of the task, the slash with arrows indicate the transfer of the task. When M=8, The time to complete all tasks is 18, so T=18, which is close to the Minimize T\(T=15  0  1   2   3  4   5  6  7   8   9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18  19  P 0 P 1  P 2  P 3  P 4  
 


From the Fig.4, we can get the calculate completion time\(T\(P i of each node: T\(P 0 10, T\(P 1 15, T\(P 2 8 T\(P 3 14, T\(P 4 17. The computing time of each node\(T c P i  is equal to the calculate completion time minus the transfer time of each node, also we can get the computing time of each node from the Fig.4: T c P 0 10, T c P 1 15, T c P 2 4 T c P 3 12, T c P 4 14. Because the linear programming model doesn’t consider the node cannot transfer two tasks at one time so the Minimize T should equal to the maximum of the computing time of each node in the model. The time of each node spend on the computing is equal to the completion time minus the transfer time, the computing time of each node is T c P 0 10, T c P 1 15, T c P 2 14, T c P 3 12, T c P 4 14, so the Minimize T=max\(T c P I 15, this verify the correct of the model, the scheduling in the Fig. 4 is the optimal scheduling V  S UMMARY AND O UTLOOK  Scheduling algorithm has been one of the hot and difficult problems in grid computing. In this paper, we proposed a small heap tree model and a heuristic task scheduling algorithm. In this algorithm, we consider the computing power and bandwidth for each node in the model and assign task for each node in an integrated manner, then use the SimGrid [7  to  simulate and analyze the algorithm, and get good result. But the algorithm still has some problems, such as didn’t consider the task’s computing and bandwidth requirements, the load balancing, dependencies between tasks.

our idealized scenario, we have a unimodal fitness landscape, and thus our local best fit will be the global best fit; however, this will not be the case for more complex situations, having multimodal landscapes.  Such scenarios are to be expected for implementations that are more realistic Substitutions are another way of injecting diversity into the gene pool. With substitution, values for individual genes are swapped. In the present scenario, this is akin to changing a latitude value while fixing longitude, or vice versa. Lastly a small fraction of guesses by the ECM are  clones  of the parent, having identical genetic structure. The combination of these four processes \(crossover, mutation, substitution and cloning optimal genotype while eliminating weaker genetic structures.  The ECM design allows the user to select the ratio of guesses that are produced via crossover vs. other processes Some of these genetic processes can be seen operating in Figure 3, which shows a typical example of the ECM  Figure 3:  Location of 100 plume source location guesses in each of four different generations  spacecraft observations of the circular analytical plume with 0% noise is the reference case; crossover/mutation is 50/50  see text and Figure 4 cross represents a single guess. Guesses are essentially random in Generation 1, but begin to  converge on a solution by Generation 5.  Convergence continues through Generation 10, and by Generation 20, most guesses  are within a fraction of a degree of the correct solution  behavior over several generations \(spacecraft observations of the circular analytical plume with 0% noise are assumed In each generation of this example, the ECM makes 100 guesses of the plume center location, with a 50/50 ratio of genetic crossover to the other processes. Each of the crosses in Figure 3 represents the location of a single guess \(of the center of an individual test plume region in which our steady state plume is located \(as illustrated in Figure 1 region to search only a 20  x 20  box that encompasses the observations Generation 1 shows the arbitrary distribution of the first 100 guesses. For each of these guesses, the plume model prepares an idealized plume centered at the latitude longitude of the guess, measurements of which are then compared to the set of spacecraft observations. Following the algorithm discussed above, those guesses that most closely fit the observations have their genetic information carried forward into the subsequent generation to seed a portion of the next 100 guesses, with the remaining portion being generated through mutation, substitution and cloning As quickly as in Generation 5 \(Figure 3, top right 7 significant number of guesses are seen converging on a solution. This convergence improves through Generation 10, although we still see the same fixed number of mutations \(the point at 9  latitude, -6  longitude is an example of a mutation have converged to within a fraction of a degree of the correct solution at \(0  0   substitution of a single gene on a number of guesses in Generation 20, which produce the  cross  shape apparent in the figure. For these guesses, either latitude or longitude is replaced, with the other gene held at its prior best-fit value By adjusting the fraction of mutations and substitutions correctly, one can balance the need for diversity with speed of convergence. In the absence of any mutations or substitutions, the solution will converge on the first local best fit it obtains, which may or may not be the global best fit. At the other extreme, a 100% mutation/substitution rate yields scattershot, or random, guesses, and provides no 


yields scattershot, or random, guesses, and provides no computational advantage over a brute-force solution, since determination of the global best fit only can be made after the full parameter space has been explored. A optimal medium exists somewhere between these two extremes.  A series of tests were performed to identify the best ratio to use in our ECM simulations \(Figure 4 tests was run out for 40 generations with 100 guesses in each generation, and the best-fit solution \(the lowest value of f from the 100 guesses ratio is ~50% crossover, 50% mutation \(including cloning and substitution search, but also provides efficient convergence to the global best fit  Figure 4: Demonstration of improved fitness for various ratios of crossover to mutation in a  sample ECM run \(spacecraft observations of the circular analytical plume with 0% noise is the reference case  identical plume models were run for 40 generations, but with each having the indicated percent of crossover and mutation. Lower  values of the ordinate indicate a better match between the plume model and observations. We see that a 50/50 split between  crossover and mutation provides the quickest path to a best-fit solution  We use this ratio for all the tests performed in Section 4 Generally, we obtain good convergence in 25 or fewer generations, each containing 100 test plumes \(2500 total compared with the more than one million required for a brute-force search over the 1440 x 720 points in the original grid Other minimization algorithms, such as LevenbergMarquardt \(L-M G-N significant disadvantages over the ECM for this type of problem.  First, because L-M and G-N are gradient-based algorithms, they require the landscape of the fitness function being minimized to be smooth, with a well-defined gradient. The function, f, being minimized in our tests however, has a sharp  spike  at the best-fit value, and a flat gradient most everywhere else. \(In other words, test plumes that do not exactly match the observations generally have the same poor fitness value regardless of the selection of genes global, minimizers.  If a guess is made and falls close to a 8 local minimum, the algorithm can be trapped around the local minimum and never find the global best fit.  The design of the ECM alleviates both of these problems  it functions well even with poorly defined gradients, and is designed to search for and identify the global best-fit solution There are other alternative approaches to identifying global minima such as the simulated annealing \(SA do not suffer the aforementioned problems.  The SA approach, as with the ECM, iteratively selects new solutions to the minimization problem; however, the decision to  accept  the new solution in SA is typically made in a probabilistic sense, independent of the new solution  s fitness.  With the ECM, a new solution is only accepted if the fitness is improved over the prior best fit There are two additional drawbacks to applying an approach like SA to this particular problem, although they best manifest themselves under less idealized conditions than those used here.  First, SA cannot handle problems that involve multiple competing objectives.  For example, we may be interested in identifying not only the source location of a plume, but also the surface emission flux or duration of emission. For such a problem, SA is forced to use an aggregated single objective by combining the competing objectives into a single weighted objective function, which is then iteratively optimized.  The ECM, on the other hand 


is then iteratively optimized.  The ECM, on the other hand can handle these multiple, simultaneous objectives without compromising accuracy in achieving each objective, and hence, is significantly more flexible Second, SA cannot find multiple local optimal solutions simultaneously.  In future implementations of our plume identification algorithm, we will likely have environments with multiple plumes, and minima corresponding to each solution.  The ECM is capable of efficiently handling this problem by partitioning the search space into multiple parts and having sub-populations, each of which focuses on a different part of the domain.  Since SA is a one-solution optimization algorithm, it cannot find multiple local solutions simultaneously For the present task, SA provides a viable alternative to obtaining the location of our simulated, idealized plume however it quickly becomes impractical when the problem becomes more complex and more realistic. Under those conditions, the flexibility of the ECM becomes a great asset 4. RESULTS A number of tests were performed to quantify accuracy in determining plume surface location as a function of the number of observations, level of instrument noise observation footprint size, and knowledge of actual plume shape. For most of the tests discussed in this section, we have assumed the simple, circular plume shape for both the actual and test plumes. This allows us to focus specifically on the singular objective of each test without dealing with differences in plume shape.  The exception to this broad assumption, is, of course, when we evaluate the role of our knowledge of actual plume shape itself, in which case we retain the circular shape for our actual plume and employ the zonally asymmetric one for our test plume Number of Observations We have shown previously \(Figure 1 circular plume appears like when observed for different lengths of time. We have performed a series of tests without random noise, for varying observation periods \(1 day, 10 days, 100 days, 1000 days using only observations that fall within  10  of what appears to be the plume center. Because of the Gaussian shape of the plume, tracer strengths at locations distant from the center are inconsequential and their contribution to f in Eq. 3 can be ignored.  Consequently, we can reduce our search space \(i.e. the region in which the ECM makes its guesses  x 20  box, which encloses the region with the strongest observations \(again, our steadystate approximation assures us that the plume source location must be within the region of strongest observations We have found that the accuracy in finding the correct plume center location generally increases as the number of measurements increases, as shown in Table 1. The results for the best-fit surface source location \(latitude and longitude with corresponding error in km generations. This demonstrates that, while it is not apparent from a cursory glance at Figure 1 that the source location of the true plume can be gleaned from the spacecraft coverage with any precision \(as the blurring of the original plume is quite evident amount of information to allow the best-fit latitude and longitude to determined by the ECM with high accuracy With observations of such a surface source over several tens of days, we should be able to decrease the source location uncertainty to levels that fall within the mobility range of future surface rovers \(20-40 km days or less of coverage \(about 1.5 martian years length of time of the primary science phase of most Mars missions Table 1:  Best-fit latitude and longitude positions for the circular plume model for varying lengths of observation

As such signal-to-noise problems are unavoidable, we must attempt to interpret their influence on the measurement result by introducing random noise into each observation and gauging the effect this has on our best-fit solution. To emulate, qualitatively, noise of various amounts, in separate tests we have added a noise term with a 3? distribution of either 10, 100 or 1000% of the local observation strength to each individual spacecraft observation. The impact of this noise term on the circular plume, relative to the perfect \(0% error Figure 5 There are 100 days of observations in each example. The results for the determination of the plume source location are presented in Table 2. While Figure 5 shows only one instance in which random noise at a specific amount has been applied, for Table 2  at each level of measurement uncertainty  the evaluation of plume source location was done ten times to account for the random factor and the variance among these ten cases is what is reported For low levels of measurement noise, in the tens of percent range, the results are largely indistinguishable from the noise-free standard, and uncertainty in position remains low relative to the noise-free instance from 10% to 100%, and then to 1000%, the ability to identify the plume source location becomes significantly diminished. With 100% uncertainty, individual measurements can vary by up to a factor of two, thus introducing  ghost  local maxima in the signal which are then interpreted as being close to the plume source location This phenomenon is significantly increased in the 1000 case. Note that, while Figure 5 shows only one case of random noise applied to the observations, the ghost local maxima do move around at this level of noise in different samplings, thus partly explaining the high uncertainty in source location  Figure 5:  Illustration of varying levels of instrument noise on the noise-free plume  measurement \(upper left of observations. As instrument noise increases, the plume source location is even less obvious  so that the accuracy to which the plume source location can be isolated is reduced 10 Table 2:  Variance in best-fit latitude and longitude solutions produced by the ECM for varying measurement uncertainty.

 Footprint Size We performed a series of experiments demonstrating the role of measurement footprint size on source location uncertainty. As the footprint size decreases, the spatial extent over which the signal is averaged decreases and, in principle, provides better isolation of the peak signals from the adjacent, weaker  wings  of the plume \(Figure 6 footprint size is decreased from 200 km to 10 km, the retrieved shape from the observations better matches the  truth  although at the expense of a decrease in the area sampled in the same spatial domain. Table 3 bears out the competing influence of increased signal isolation and decreased spatial coverage for a 100-day observation campaign.  From a 200 km \(cross-track footprint, there is a ~45% decrease in uncertainty, but beyond this, there is no further gain. Figure 6 illustrates the cause of this strange behavior.  At 200 km \(upper left have near complete surface coverage, with substantial overlap, over the course of 100 days.  At 100 km \(upper right beginning to see small gaps in coverage, suggesting that for 100 days of observations, the amount of  repeat  coverage is small.  Hence, by reducing the cross-track footprint from 200 km to 100 km, we are provided the benefits of a smaller footprint  Figure 6:  Comparison of different observational footprint sizes.  Top left panel \(200 km  the nominal footprint size used in this study.  As footprint size is reduced, the shape of the plume is better defined, but at  the expense of spatial coverage Additionally, the peak plume strength in the observation set approaches that of the  true   plume \(cf. Figure 2b in black space indicates the fraction of the surface not observed by the instrument 11 Table 3:  Best-fit latitude and longitude positions for the derived plume source locations and consequent error for varying footprint widths Footprint Width km Best-Fit Latitude   Best-Fit Longitude  Error [km 200 -0.1862 -0.4960 31.3 100 -0.1523 -0.2485 17.2 50 -0.1178 -0.2390 15.8 20 -0.1195 -0.2414 15.9 10 -0.1276 -0.2391 16.0  but are not sacrificing overall surface coverage. For footprint sizes smaller than 100 km \(Figure 6, lower row the two effects counter each other relatively equally, and there is generally no improvement to the best fit. However as was discussed previously, for a fixed footprint size, an increase in the number of observations \(up to the point where coverage begins to substantially overlap improve the best fit. Footprint size is not an easily adjustable parameter for a spacecraft instrument and appears not to be as significant a factor in the plume source location error budget as is measurement spatial coverage Plume Shape In previous tests, we used the idealized case of a circular plume and assumed the same shape for the test plumes However, in reality, we will have no knowledge of the actual shape of the plume from our limited, defocused measurements, so we will need to make an educated guess as to the plume shape that is being observed. While knowledge of the meteorological context of the plume observations may be available, which would allow a 


observations may be available, which would allow a simulation of the plume shape using a GCM \(plume lifetime can be inferred from the plume  s spectroscopically determined composition discrepancy between the real plume shape and the GCMderived shape used for the test plumes in the ECM analysis of the observational data. We simulated this uncertainty by adopting our real plume shape from Eqn. 1 \(circular the test plume from Eqn. 2 \(zonally asymmetric expect this difference to result in a generally poorer solution. In fact, the results in Table 4 for lower surface coverage \(1 and 10 day campaigns error with coverage is not certain to be monotonic Interestingly, the errors in localizing the source when there is a reasonably high degree of surface coverage by the measurements are comparable to the results in Table 1 \(both cases assuming noise-free measurements reasonable, but not perfect, understanding of the observed plume shape, a campaign length of several tens of days or more, again, brings the uncertainty in plume source location to within the range of a landed rover Table 4:  Best-fit latitude and longitude positions for different campaign lengths, but assuming different actual and test plume shapes Campaign Length days Best-Fit Latitude   Best-Fit Longitude  Error [km 1 -0.5361 -0.2151 34.3 10 -0.1574 1.1961 71.5 100 -0.1692 0.2477 17.8 1000 -0.1389 0.2569 17.3  5. FUTURE PLANS A more ambitious implementation of this scheme would incorporate output of a full GCM in lieu of our basic analytic test plume model in the ECM framework. With this approach, the set of ECM guesses in a particular generation would spawn a suite of GCM model runs, with the  best guess  solutions from the completed GCM runs identified by the ECM and used to prepare the next generation of guesses.  Such an approach would be entirely autonomous and the best application of the GCM to the problem In the simplified demonstration herein, the importance of the ECM is somewhat understated.  Indeed, for simple plume shapes, a reasonable guess of plume location can be made directly by identifying the peak value in the observation set. This is an unfortunate side effect of this simple, two-gene demonstration.  The real value of the ECM manifests itself when we consider a parameter space of multiple genes.  Under more complex scenarios \(multiple plumes, various lifetimes, etc certainty, isolate individual plume locations. If the steadystate assumption is not valid, and the plume is evolving with time, the age of the plume becomes an additional gene we must consider.  Preliminary exploration of plume age as a third gene has begun, and we have obtained positive results from the ECM.  Further work is necessary to incorporate additional genes, and will be pursued in future work 6. CONCLUSIONS We have discussed the framework of a novel new approach to finding atmospheric plume source locations on planetary surfaces from orbit by using existing numerical analysis methods. This approach relies on the ability of genetic algorithms to quickly identify global best-fit solutions to a multivariate problem. We have found that, under idealized conditions, a source location can be identified to within tens of km on the surface within a couple dozen iterations of the ECM system using idealized plume shapes, even with 


ECM system using idealized plume shapes, even with limited spacecraft observations to constrain the system Error is minimized by increasing the number of observations, and by reducing the instrument uncertainty 12 Additionally, development of instruments with narrower footprints may contribute to a decrease in the source location error. Error due to uncertainty in the knowledge of the observed plume shape is reduced when observations are acquired in a long duration campaign. Plans for future development of this approach have been outlined, which involve the incorporation of general circulation models to supplant the idealized plumes used in the present study. The benefits of the genetic algorithms used here are maximized when multiple genes are employed, rather than just latitude and longitude. Examples of these genes would be parameters such as plume age, species lifetime and time evolution of source emission flux This approach can be of great value to planetary exploration programs, which seek high-precision identification of regions of interest on planetary surfaces to target future landed missions. By applying the methods presented here to realistic atmospheres, we can augment the direct observations made by orbiting spacecraft with a robust indirect approach, saving both time and money 7.

In this paper, we formalize the current state of AM: Data are a table of symbols. The patterns are the formulas of input symbols that repeat. The method of derivations is the most conservative and reliable one, namely, mathematical deductions. The results are somewhat surprising 1. Patterns are properties of the isomorphic class, not an individual relation - This implies that the notion of patterns may not mature yet and explains why there are so many extracted association rules 2. Un-interpreted attributes \(features can be enumerated 3. Generalized associations can be found by solving integral linear inequalities. Unfortunately, the number is enormous. This signi?es the current notion of data and patterns \(implied by the algorithms 4. Real world modeling may be needed to create a much more meaningful notion of patterns. In the current state of AM, a pattern is simply a repeated data that may have no real world meaning. So we may need to introduce some semantics into the data model [12],[10],[11 Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE References 1] R.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
