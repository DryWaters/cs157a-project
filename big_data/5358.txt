Association rules generated by applying FARM 6. Conclusion The information and online services of an eGovernment portal should be delivered accurately effectively and efficiently to different groups of users to meet their expectations and preferences. Knowing the needs and preferences of users is very importan t For this purpose WEBVS is proposed to visualize the analytic and performance results of WMS together with web page information in web graphs and generate interesting and meaningful association rules. Such web graphs and association rules help t he web administrator to discover and locate where anomalies or interesting phenomenon are and, hence take actions to improve the portal when necessary for providing a successful e-Government portal 7.

We have not test for those variables   The projects that we analyzed were stable and had a few number of transactions per day \(Table 1\ Less stable or more dynamic projects may yield different results   Like in t h e  or der i ng o f  cha nge s m a y i n fl ue nc e  the results for Navigation and Error Prevention VI  C ONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK  This article shows that software module modification association rules derived from our stable industrial environment were more effective than those derived from the OSS projects reported in the literature. As association rules are already being successfully applied for impact analysis in this context [5  o u r  resu l t s i n d i c a tes th at th ey c a n  als o  b e  effectively applied in industrial environments such as the one we studied  We believe that this finding may stimulate further studies in the industry and, hopefully, motivate them to invest on association mining to support software maintenance and evolution activities  It is important to observe that in our analysis systems with little evolutive maintenance, such as the Marketing and the Customer Management System, yield rules with precision and recall better than the average. This was expected as more stable systems should yield better association rules Also, independent of the number of transaction per day systems with small training sets, such as the Accounting and the Web Services Systems, yield rules with precision and recall worse than the average. This was also expected, as this number training examples helps to strengthen the rules As mentioned before, we adapted the software engineering experimental process described in Wohlin et al  o so ft w a r e  r e po si t o r i e s m i ni ng e x p e r i m e nt s. We be l i e v e that the studies, applications, and tools for software repository mining can benefit from this type of approach Rigorous experimental description facilitates replication of studies and the executing of systematic reviews and other types of secondary analysis in the field [18  C o n s id e r in g th e  number of studies being done in the area, we believe that experimental formalism combined with approaches like standardization of data exchange formats among software repositories [1  can  con t ri b u t e t o f a cili tat e th e ex ecu t i o n  and replication of studies in the area As future work, we will start to look at fine granularity associations, analyzing classes and methods as opposed to files. We will also analyze relationships between coupling and the associations mined from version control systems We are currently finishing a Microsoft Visual Studio plug-in to use the mined rules to aid programmers on the fly It will work as a monitor that verifies saved files and warns programmers about unverified associated files. This will facilitate the programmers’ impact analysis effort and mitigate errors during program modification. After its completion, the plug-in will be experimentally evaluated in carefully controlled case studies. Lastly, we will use our Data Warehouse [6 o t e st s e ve ra l  o t her so ft w a r e m i ni ng  techniques over the data we have already gathered and preprocessed A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This study could only be developed due to the full support of CIAL–Brazil and its staff.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
