The Impact of Security Issues on Willingness-to-Share in Community Wireless Networks   Paul Beckman San Francisco State University pbeckman@sfsu.edu  Dirk Shim San Francisco State University dirk@sfsu.edu   Abstract  Several business models have been proposed to create çwireless citiesé, municipalities with complete wireless connectivity throughout.  These business models are for-profit, non-profit, or public-private enterprises, but none has proven to be completely 
successful. Community wire less networks, wherein members of the community provide the wireless infrastructure, are one possible solution to this problem.  For this type of model to succeed, however end-users must have confidence in the security of the wireless infrastructure 168 residents of a U.S. West Coast city responded to an on-line survey asking them their attitudes about networks, security, and willingness to çshareé their home wireless computer network.  A surprisingly large number were willing to share their network for no compensation.  An even larger number of residents would be willing to share their networks for some type 
of compensation.  This result bodes well for this mode if communities are willing to compensate their residents and secure their networks   1. Introduction  The topic of community wireless networks has become quite popular in the past couple of years as many municipalities in the United States [1 a v e  begun programs to become wireless cities The ultimate goal of such programs is generally to provide either for free or for a small monthly payment, wireless 
Internet access to all city residents.  Another possibly large benefit to the municipality is use of wireless Internet access to both mobile and stationary city workers.  In any case, community wireless networks can be investigated from a variety of perspectives business model, financial, technical, social, legal, and political  2. Literature search  In 2002, in one of the first research projects investigating the rise of home wireless computer networks and associated models for organizing them 
Verma and Beckman ugg es ted di m e n s ion s along which one could compare possible structures for organizations trying to supply full wireless connectivity in residential neighborhoods.  They noted the inception of the commercial model, called a WISP wireless Internet service provider\d compared it to the non-profit model, called a NAN, \(neighborhood area network\which later came to be called a CWN community wireless network\The authors suggested that both models might co-exist and even compete for the same end-customer.  Finally, they examined the 
impact of technological, financial, legal, and social issues on both for-profit and non-profit organizational models In a follow-on research project in 2002, Verma et  o ted th at predictin g  issues or dimensions that would impact future business models in the wireless Internet domain is an unstructured problem.  Therefore they proposed and implemented the Delphi research approach to finding those issues/dimensions.  Using the four dimensions of their prior research project technological, financial, legal, social\he Delphi 
experts involved in this research project suggested many detailed sub-topics within each of those four dimensions.  The experts also suggested two additional topics that were likely to be relevant to the success of future business models: the creation and enforcement of technical standards, and the ability of customers to make micro-payments In 2004, Bar and Hernan e x a m in ed th e qu e s tio n of whether localized and decentralized efforts to implement wireless networks would dominate over 
nationalized and centralized efforts.  They argued that the mechanisms that drove the creation and expansion of the wired Internet are fundamentally different than those that will drive wireless access to the Internet They used a theoretical argument to pose several possible scenarios for the future expansion of wireless Internet access in U.S. cities Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 1 978-0-7695-3450-3/09 $25.00 © 2009 IEEE 


Also in 2004 and from a slightly different perspective, Um m p ared com m unit y  w i reles s  networks and commercial wireless networks in an attempt to predict which would be the dominant model in the future or whether both might survive.  This research project used a case study analysis that compared one contemporary viable commercial organization Surf and Sip d one contemporary viable non-profit organization \(NoCatNet\mali noted that payment and financial issues are the largest difference between these two models.  He also predicted that long-term sustainability will hinge, for a NAN, on its user and community support, and for a WISP, on its ability to integrate services In a 2004 whitepaper, Lehr et am i n ed the  impact of emerging wireless technologies on the debate as to whether or not local governments should take an active role in creating and managing the last mile of broadband Internet connectivity.  They propose several issues that impact this debate, particularly: local government investment increases the value of other local government services, lower technology costs increase the likelihood that private providers will create for-profit solutions, and characteristics of wireless technologies impacts the choice of the optimal technology solution for providing last mile  broadband Internet connectivity In a policy position paper of  examined the role of governmental bodies on wireless broadband projects.  The author suggests that the government vs. commercial debate will be most influenced by the seven issues of: competition performance competition, continuous improvement technological change and lock-in, obsolescence, risk and uncertainty.  The author concluded that, because of the specific characteristics of wireless technologies governments should not approach the provision of public wireless broadband with the same perspective used with other public utilities such as electricity, gas water, and roads Also in 2006, Bar and Park n v e st i g a t ed pol i c y  implications of U.S. municipalities embarking on citywide wireless projects.  They suggest that these projects are popular because wi-fi technology is relatively inexpensive and cities gain intangible benefits by offering wireless Internet access to city employees, residents, and commercial enterprises They then examined possible business models, guided by who owns the network and who operates the network and came up with 9 different owner/operator business models In 2006, Ta a m i n ed th e leg a l an d  policy issues related to municipalities being early adopters in providing wireless Internet access for their residents.  Their research project aimed to answer questions about proposed and attempted business models used by municipalities to provide wireless Internet access.  They concluded that the legal issues revolve around cities trying to achieve the three objectives: 1\upport of residents, 2\elopment of a sound financial plan, and 3\ ensuring equality among various telecommunication providers.  The authors also point out that impending state legislation may induce municipalities to adopt processes or even business models that are inferior, merely to circumvent or beat the deadline of such legislation In 2007, Middleton a m i n ed th e  f i eld o f  wireless Internet access from the perspective of creating a valuable public infrastructure.  The author presented a framework that can be used to assess the value of a public wireless computer network.  The framework is based on responses to questions related to: the primary purpose of the network, available network bandwidth, users need for mobility, devices likely to be used to access the network, and ability for users to pay for network access.  The author concluded that pure public wireless infrastructure projects are not meeting the needs of users, but that pure  commercial wireless infrastructure projects are also not likely to meet the goals of the municipalities in which they are created Also in 2007, Abdelaal and A pos ed a  typology for identifying six business models that might be used for creating sustainable community wireless networks.  They examined this issue from the perspective of social capital such as volunteering donating money, donating hardware, etc.\ and how it plays a role in selecting the appropriate business model for creating a community wireless network.  They also noted that the characteristics of the community will have a role in selecting the most appropriate CWN business model.  Finally, they suggested that the six business models are not necessarily mutually exclusive and that the creator of a CWN may choose a mix of the six business models Perhaps in response to the lack of success of existing business models in creating wireless cities a new business model has arisen in the past couple of years in which individual residents franchise their home wireless computer network with the support of a larger organization.  Some enterprises will sell \(or in some cases, give away\ wireless network routers that a resident can install in their own home.  By paying the central organization a monthly fee, one can then access the wireless router of any other franchisee.  For such a business model to work however, residents must be willing to accept outsiders accessing their own home wireless computer network The existing literature therefore shows that there have been many business models proposed and Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 2 


attempted in providing community-wide wireless networks, but none has been an obviously overwhelming success.  For-profit, not-for-profit, and public-private models have all been tried with very limited success.  Many, if not most, of these projects have failed due to the large cost involved in creating the required wireless infrastructure.  One possibility that has not yet been seriously attempted is using the wireless infrastructure that already exists throughout most communities.  That infrastructure is the one created by individual wireless network routers installed by residents in their own homes.  If a city wishes to use this infrastructure, however, it must know much more about its residents attitudes toward network security and allowing others to access their own wireless computer network This research project was initiated to find answers from residents to questions such as: do you secure your home computer network?  If not, why not?  Would you be willing to share your home wireless computer network?  If so, would you require some type of compensation for doing so By finding the answers to these questions as given directly by the residents of a city, it may be possible to create a viable model that will solve many of the problems inherent in creating a wireless city without incurring the costs associated in creating a commercially-generated wireless network  3. Methodology  3.1. On-line survey  A pilot on-line survey was created and tested with approximately 40 residents of the city of Oakland California.  Using the results of that survey and the comments of the respondents, a larger on-line survey of 16 questions was created.  Letters were mailed to 4783 households of Oakland, California requesting the resident respond to the on-line survey.  Of those 4783 households, 168 on-line surveys were completed resulting in a response rate of about 3.5%.  To induce residents to fill out the on-line survey, two 4 Gbyte Apple iPod Nanos were randomly given away to respondents who left an email address for contact The city of Oakland, California, was chosen because it had neighborhoods of varying income but similar housing density and style \(i.e., single-family dwellings\ollecting data from neighborhoods of differing income levels was important because it would not be possible to extrapolate the survey and data analysis results if all data was collected from residents of only one income level.  Ensuring that housing density and style were similar across all respondents ensured that data collected about detected residential wireless networks \(part of a related research project would not be skewed by the residential density in one neighborhood compared to another.  For example comparing the number of detected residential wireless networks in a neighborhood comprised mostly of apartments would indicate ceteris paribus a higher density of network nodes than the number of network nodes found in a neighborhood comprised mostly of single-family homes.  This higher network node density would, however, be due to the higher housing density rather than to the higher number of network nodes per housing unit, which is the unit of measure under investigation in the related research project  3.2. Survey question topics  The on-line survey asked 16 general questions related to residential wireless computer networks and those who use them.  The questions \(and the possible responses\ were on the topics of 1 type of home Internet access \(Dial-up, DSL Cable Modem, T1, I don t know 2. respondent s sex \(male, female 3. respondent s age range \(0-20, 20-30, 30-40 40-50, 50-60, 60-70, 70 and over 4 other wireless Internet access \(yes, no 5. if yes response on 4, what type of other wireless Internet access \(free-form text response 6 is network secured \(yes, no, don t know 7. if no response on 6, why not \(I did not know it was possible, I did not know how to make it secure, It was too time consuming to do, It was too difficult to do, I was afraid of locking myself out of my own network, I want to share it with the outside world, Other please specify 8. if Other: please specify response on 7 specific reason why network not secured free-form text response 9 knowledge of respondent concerning wireless computer networks \(Not knowledgeable Slightly knowledgeable, Knowledgeable Very knowledgeable, An expert 10 age of wireless network \(Less than 6 months Between 6 months and 1 year, Between 1 year and 3 years, More than 3 years, I do not know 11. importance of Internet access compared to other household technology expenses such as landline phone, cellular phone, cable/satellite TV \(Not important, Slightly important Average, Important, Very important Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 3

Analysis  Software from Zoomerang w a s u s ed t o  construct the on-line survey and to collect the survey responses.  Response data were collected by the on-line survey software and stored on the server website.  The survey data were downloaded and stored in a spreadsheet six weeks after the initial letters were sent the city residents.  By that point in time, no new survey response sets had been completed in the previous week.  Multiple worksheets were then created to store and analyze the specific responses for each survey question  4.1. Quantitative analysis  Survey questions 1-4, 6, 7, and 9-13, and 15 forced the respondent to give pre-defined responses.  This was enforced by giving respondents single or multiselection radio buttons from which to choose their responses.  Spreadsheet calculations were used to perform simple percentages of responses for each of these questions.  The results of those calculations are presented in the quantitative analysis results section below  4.2. Qualitative analysis  Survey questions 5, 8, 14, and 16 allowed the respondent to give open-ended responses.  This was enabled by giving respondents free-form text fields in which to type any response they wished.  Spreadsheets were used to store and organize the responses for each of these questions.  The results of those summaries are presented in the qualitative analysis results section below  5. Results  5.1. Quantitative analysis results  Table 1 displays the results of the responses to question 1 \(type of home Internet access\.  Note: data from the respondent who indicated they did not have Internet access at home was not included in the rest of the analysis.  This resulted in 167 usable responses for the subsequent data analysis steps   Table 1.

Also table 11 does not show that a total of 72 respondents gave some type of response to this question.  It is apparent that respondents would be willing to leave their home wireless computer networks open for a variety of different types of compensation.  Note that 38 of the 168 \(22.6%\ondents would be willing to accept free Internet access elsewhere in return for giving others Internet access at their own home which is the essence of the franchising business model discussed above  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6

wireless networks unsecured, but only if they had a guarantee that it would not jeopardize their own personal data Some respondents left more detailed responses such as As it turns out, I work at a small wireless networking company.  I have long wanted to set up a series of neighborhood wide access points sharing the costs network among our neighbors and reducing our overall bills to access the internet.  This could be done with security and minimal expense and time, but I haven't had even that much time to set it up  and from another respondent whose neighbor apparently did what the previous respondent was considering My home internet service is wireless, too.  We have an internet entrepreneur in the 'hood who started by syndicating a T1 line to half a dozen neighbors.  He has expanded beyond the neighbors and now has a $3MM/year business.  I pay $49/mo for a very fast connection that arrives at my house wirelessly   6. Conclusion  Results of the survey show numerous surprising outcomes.  With regard to those hoping to implement some type of community wireless network or similarly based business model, there appears to be some hope that residents are or can be persuaded to let others use their home wireless computer networks Perhaps most surprising relevant to the community wireless network model is that, of the 40 respondents who did not secure their home networks, 6 directly stated that they wanted to share their Internet access with outsiders.  An additional 3 respondents stated this in their free-form response to the question.  This implies that many residents would not require any compensation at all for leaving their network open to support a community wireless network.  Also, almost 50% of all respondents indicated that they would be willing to leave their network open for some type of compensation if it were legal to do so.  Of those who would require cash compensation for leaving their network open, 75% would require $30 or less/month to do so.  This also bodes well for communities who are searching for inexpensive ways to become wireless cities   7. Limitations and future research Certainly the results of this research project are limited by the number of respondents and the geographic location in which the survey was implemented.  Researchers in other locations may well obtain different results due to the economic technological, or geographic vagaries of their respondents.  The research is also limited due to the process by which respondents completed the survey While all known mailing addresses in the survey area were canvassed in soliciting respondents to complete the on-line survey, no control was implemented over those who actually chose to complete the on-line survey.  There is therefore an unknown effect on the research results of the actual population of survey responders There are also several possible useful avenues for future research in this area.  One obvious direction to pursue is to do a more detailed statistical analysis to determine if there are patterns within the data.  That is there may be hidden or underlying relationships that would yield more valuable in sights into correlations in the dataset.  For example, there may be indications about the type of resident who is more or less likely to leave their wireless network unsecured, based on the age, sex, knowledge, etc., of the resident.  Another useful future research direction would be to gather survey data from other cities in other states or countries to see if the attitudes found in this research project are common over a larger audience of users In any case, the results of the survey show that there is definitely promise for the future of community wireless networks.  Also, it may well be possible to solicit the help of city residents in creating the underlying wireless infrastructure to build the elusive wireless city   8.

desired information provider, the needed Web services with descriptions stored in a WS repository are bound to the process. Besides abstract WS transitions, WS invocation transitions are also utilized to buy transport ticket, reserve hotel, make registration, and check received ticket and confirmations. The dashed outgoing arcs of the place ?WS repository? are read-only connections with selective Filter Schema. The way of how to bind Web services whose descriptions are stored in the repository will be explained in Section 5.3  5.2. Data and data flow modeling  XML nets provide inherent ways for data and data flow modeling. Data objects that move through XSN can be modeled as XML documents whose structure is typified by XML Schemas. Filter Schemas can be used Figure 2. XML net-based abstract service composition process for travel arrangement Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 to select, create, modify or \(partially uments and thus realize data manipulation and flow of the documents. Supported by software tools like INCOME2010 [12], non-flowing process objects, e.g roles, resources, process metrics, key factors etc., can also be modeled in XML and assigned or bound to process or process elements for validation or monitoring purposes In WSC, the flowing data objects are usually messages that serve as input and output of Web services Messages are encoded in XML format and exchanged over standard XML-based messaging protocols like SOAP. Using XML nets, messages as XML documents can be easily modeled as tokens of places and typified by XML Schemas like SOAP Schema2 In the context of WSC, message passing usually refers to asynchronous communication among Web services by sending structured data packages over transport protocols. One problem in message passing is that an output message of a Web service could be incompatible with the required input message of another WS For instance, an output message containing 3 strings as service invocation results cannot be used by a Web service which requires only 2 strings as input parameters. This message incompatibility problem can be solved with XML nets by adding a WS chaining transition as mediator between two WS invocation transitions to adjust their input and output messages. The function of the mediating transition is realized straightforward by Filter Schemas assigned to its incoming and outgoing arcs Figure 3 shows an example to illustrate how XML nets are used to solve this problem. A mediating transition ?adjust message? is added between two WS invocation transitions for reserving hotel and checking hotel reservation, respectively. The SOAP response of the hotel reservation service contains detailed information about reservation id, hotel, customer, room, price, date  2 http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope and payment status etc. The SOAP request for the reservation checking service provided by the hotel requires only reservation ID. To preclude this incompatibility, Filter Schema FS1 is used to deliver the SOAP response to the mediating transition, and FS2 to create SOAP request using reservation ID filtered from the response The mediating transition can also be used to aggregate or disassemble messages. In the first case, it acts as an AND-join transition, which means it has several 


incoming arcs and only one outgoing arc. Filter Schema of the outgoing arc contains variables used in Filter Schemas of the incoming arcs. In the latter case, the mediating transition is an AND-split transition that has only one incoming arc and several outgoing arcs. Variables of the Filter Schema assigned to the incoming arc are used to construct Filter Schemas of the outgoing arcs  5.3. Web Service Discovery and Selection  In this paper we distinguish between Web service discovery and Web service selection. While Web service discovery refers to the process of finding functionally suitable Web services in a set of service descriptions that are unknown a priori, Web service selection deals with comparing and choosing appropriate Web services from a known set of descriptions according to customized preferences, including non-functional constrains or requirements, e.g. quality of services \(QoS WS selection is often used after WS discovery to render more accurate and desirable results, especially when several Web services with the same functionalities are discovered. In WSC, WS discovery and selection are applied to achieve process dynamics by finding and integrating Web services to a predefined abstract service process at run-time Taking advantage of Filter Schemas and transition inscriptions that contribute to process rules of XML net models, we can combine WS discovery and selection Figure 3.

At development-time, Filter Schemas for service filtering can be created according to an XML schema of Web service description, e.g., WSDL Schema3, UDDI Schema4 etc. Transition inscriptions can also be used to define constraints for service selection 


also be used to define constraints for service selection At run-time, the workflow engine for XML nets interprets and evaluates Filter Schemas and transition inscriptions to filter and create Web service descriptions as XML documents. With process monitoring and administration tools which are usual components of workflow management systems, new criterions and constraints for WS discovery and selection can be incorporated at run-time by reconfiguring transition inscription statements and variable instantiations in Filter Schemas  Instantiating abstract WS transition Figure 4 shows a fragment of the abstract WSC process in Section 5.1 to demonstrate the ability of XML nets in WS discovery. To obtain transport information, Web services whose descriptions are stored in an unknown WSDL repository should be discovered The token count of the place representing the repository is supposed to be unlimited. The abstract transitions find transport info service? and ?get transport information? are used to bind and call Web services at runtime. The incoming arc of the transition ?find transport info service? is a reading connection \(represented by a dashed arc nipulative Filter Schema FS2 used to create Web service descriptions is assigned to the outgoing arc of this transition. FS1 and FS2 are both generated according to WSDL Schema  Adapting abstract WS transition at run-time Suppose that the transition ?get transport information? is used to acquire flight information. Variables in FS1 should be \(partly  3 http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl#A4.1 4 http://uddi.org/schema/uddi_v3.xsd es supplying flight information. As shown in Figure 5a the variable of the attribute filter ?name? of the element filter ?service? is instantiated with a regular expression for filtering Web services whose name contains the string ?flight?. This regular expression, together with the Filter Schema, is parsed to XQuery/XPath statements in process simulation or execution. If we use a reconfiguration tool to modify the regular expression at run-time as shown for example in Figure 5b, the transition ?get transport information? can then be adapted to acquire other transport information, e.g., train information. After a suitable WSDL document has been found, FS2 is used to create a new WSDL document for the place ?WS description by cloning the discovered document. Figure 5c shows the diagram of FS2 containing the WSDL root element definitions? and an element placeholder, which is used because the internal structure and details of the document to be created are not of interest in the case of document duplication  QoS-aware WS selection XML nets can also be used to select desired Web services if service constraints like QoS or customized preferences are taken into consideration. As WSDL and OWL-S provide no or limited ways for describing Web service?s QoS, we use in this paper OWL-QoS 43], which complements OWL-S with an ontology to specify QoS metrics for Web services, to demonstrate the ability of XML nets for \(QoS-aware Naturally, other Web service ontologies \(e.g., MOQ 11 e.g., WSLA [18 can also be used for this purpose Figure 6 shows another XML net fragment for the acquisition of transport information by selecting OWL 


acquisition of transport information by selecting OWLQoS documents which describe quality of Web services from a repository that contains 3 OWL-QoS documents discovered previously. Similar to the example in Figure 2, the Filter Schema FS1 is used to read and select appropriate OWL-QoS documents, and the Filter Schema FS2 to create new OWL-QoS documents for the place ?OWL-QoS document?. As Filter Schema provides no means for formulating inequality operators like ?&gt;? and ?&lt;=?, which are usually used to express constraints with parameters whose quantitative values are limited to a certain interval, transition inscriptions Figure 4.

Filter Schemas for Web service discovery definitions 1 service name: \\s*flight\\s*/i c definitions service name: \\s*train\\s*/i b a definitions 1 1 Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 can be used in combination with Filter Schemas to formulate QoS constrains Suppose that the traveler wants to use only the Web services that cost no more than 100 US Cent. The Filter Schema FS1 should then be created as shown in Figure 7. The variable of the attribute filter ?rdf: resource? of the element filter ?owl: onProperty? is instantiated with a regular expression to filter OWL-QoS documents specifying the property ?costUSCent?. To ensure that the maximal cost of the Web service doesn?t exceed 100 US cent, the inscription of the transition ?select transport info service? should be formulated as owl:maxCardinality &lt;= 100?. In process simulation or execution, the inscription is parsed and integrated into XQuery statements using XPath inequality operators  6. Conclusions  In this paper we presented a WSC method based on XML nets, which inherit advantages of Petri nets such as formal semantics and graphical expression. XML nets have additional strengths in the description of process and data objects, and the exchange of XMLbased structured data. The advantage of using XML nets for WSC is that control flow modeling, data and data flow modeling, and WS discovery and selection can be realized using a uniform powerful modeling language. Some uncomplicated tasks, as illustrated before, can be fulfilled without developing or using additional software components or agents. Naturally XML nets can also be combined with other Web service techniques to fulfill more complicated and demanding tasks  7.

South Korean versus American market  In terms of the effect of WOM, we find no discernable difference in the motion picture markets of South Korea and the United States. Volume of WOM is positively correlated to the following week?s revenue in both markets, and valence of WOM is not significant The effect of critical reviews, however, did not concur While the literature on the American market data reports that positive critical reviews are positively related to box office revenue[21, 34], the results on the Korean market was different. There could be several reasons for this. First, South Korea and the United States have different sources for critical reviews, and the sources may have different impacts on moviegoers Second, the characteristics of critics might be different i.e., Korean critics may prefer movies that are considered less commercial or artistic than American critics  5. Conclusion  WOM and critical reviews both are important attributes that influence box office revenue in the motion picture industry. In this study, six hypotheses related to this issue were set up and tested. Data was collected on the motion picture industry of South Korea by using several websites that provide content and statistical data about movies. Finally, data on 118 movies was collected and the movies were categorized into two groups based on the distributors of the movies If the distributor of a movie was one of the major distributors in South Korea, that movie was categorized into mainstream movies, and if not then the movie was categorized into non-mainstream movies. As expected mainstream movies had much higher box office revenue and volume of WOM than non-mainstream Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews 


movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews however, there was no big difference between mainstream and non-mainstream movies. WOM and critical reviews were usually positive H1 and H2 tested the relationship between WOM and weekly box office revenue, and the results supported the hypotheses. The volume of WOM was positively related to weekly box office revenue, while the valence of WOM had no significant effect. H3 H4a, and H4b tested the impact of critical reviews, and the results also supported the hypotheses except H4b The volume and valence of critical reviews had no consistent significances to weekly box office revenue H3 H4b. Table 7 showed that the number of critical reviews was statistically significant to aggregate box office revenue \(H4a for the attitude of critical reviews \(H4b the result more detail, an additional test was performed using only those factors related to critical reviews as independent variables. The result of the additional test supported H4, but the signs were reversed, i.e. positive critical reviews had minus signs, and negative critical reviews had plus signs. This reversed signs imply that the preference of critical reviewers is very similar to that of normal moviegoers. H5s and H6s tested the different effects of WOM and critical reviews on mainstream and non-mainstream movies. The result failed to determine that WOM give different impact on mainstream and non-mainstream movies, so H5a and H5b were rejected. H6, however, was supported, i.e the effects of critical reviews were different for mainstream and non-mainstream movies. There were no significant relationships between critical reviews and aggregate box office revenue in mainstream movies. For non-mainstream movies, however, the volume of critical reviews and the percentage of negative critical reviews were significant. Nonmainstream movies have fewer sources from which consumers can get information, and this might explain the results The above findings lead to several managerial implications. First, producers and distributors of movies could forecast weekly box office revenue by looking at previous weeks? volume of WOM. It does not matter what attitude people have when they spread WOM, the important factor is its volume. Therefore producers and distributors need to develop an appropriate strategy to manage WOM for their movies For example, the terms related to WOM marketing such as buzz and viral marketing are easily found Second, for the distributors who usually distribute less commercial and more artistic movies, and consequently have a smaller market compared to the major distributors, critical reviews can impact their movies box office revenues in a significant way. There are usually fewer sources for information for nonmainstream movies than mainstream movies, and so small efforts could leverage the outcomes. Finally, for those who are dealing with mainstream movies, the finding that the valence of WOM and critical reviews do not have significant relationship with box office revenue can have certain implications. Particularly, the attitude of critical reviews showed reversed effects Therefore, they may need to concentrate on other features rather than attitude of moviegoers or critical reviews, such as encouraging moviegoers to spread WOM This study contributes to the understanding of the motion picture industry, especially the relationship between box office revenue and WOM including critical reviews. There are existing studies that already 


critical reviews. There are existing studies that already dealt with similar issues, but this study has some differentiated features compare to prior studies. First the data used in this study was collected from South Korea, while most of the relevant studies usually focus on the North American market. This helps to provide the opportunity to understand the international market especially the Asian market, even though South Korea is a small part of it in terms of the motion picture industry. Second, movies were categorized to two groups, i.e. mainstream and non-mainstream and this study attempted to determine how WOM impacts these categories differently by testing several hypotheses In this study, there are also several limitations that could be dealt with in future research. First, using box office revenue as a dependent variable is more meaningful for distributers rather than producers. Due to there is close correlation between box office revenue and number of screens, one of producers? main concerns is how many screens their movies can be played on. Moreover, DVD sales are also important measurement for success of movies these days, and so it also could be a dependent variable. Therefore, it could be possible to give more fruitful managerial implications to various players in the motion picture industry by taking some other dependent variables Second, in this study, movies were categorized simply as mainstream and non-mainstream movies, but there could be further studies with diverse techniques of movie categorizations. For example, it would be possible to study the varying influence of WOM or critical reviews on different genres or movie budgets Third, an interesting finding of this study is that positive critical reviews could have negative relationship with box office revenue while negative critical reviews could have positive relationship. This study tried to provide a reasonable discussion on the issue, but more studies could be elaborate on it  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 References  1] Dellarocas, C., The Digitization of Word of Mouth Promise and Challenges of Online Feedback Mechanisms Management Science, 2003. 49\(10 2] Bone, P.F., Word-of-mouth effects on short-term and long-term product judgments.
