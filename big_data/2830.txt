1 Strategies for Time-based Multi-path Secure Information Disseminations in MANETs Xiaoyan Hong Bo Gu Qunwei Zheng Department of Computer Science University of Alabama Tuscaloosa AL 35487 Abstract  Sending messages securely to protect condentiality in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks is a challenging issue due to the open wireless media the spacial constraints and the difculty in establishing strict security mechanisms To tackle the problem we have presented a scheme where a source node sends shares of a message at different times 
Due to node mobility the shares will be routed through different intermediate nodes It is highly unlikely that a particular intermediate node an eavesdropper is able to be on or around many of these routes and collect enough shares to reconstruct the original message The scheme is particular suitable for applications that can tolerate long message delays as those studied in Delay Tolerant Networks The paper focuses on analyzing the strategies that a node can use in determining the intervals between two shares and in tuning to applications requirements 
on delay bounds The results provide a guideline for the conguration and the security of the scheme We further investigate the inuence from various mobility models on the security property The results show big differences among the models and the practical aspect of the scheme In all our proposed scheme provides a valuable alternative for delay tolerant applications to enhance message condentiality I I NTRODUCTION Mobile Ad Hoc Networks are vulnerable to many attacks due to the open wireless media and the difﬁculty 
in establishing strict security mechanisms in a highly dynamic network with changing members and mobility For the purpose of sending messages securely for conﬁdentiality several approaches can be used e.g message encryption spatial multi-path routing and temporal multi-path routing Encrypting messages before transmitting requires the distribution of cryptography keys Both symmetric key and public key schemes face challenges due to the dynamic nature of mobile ad hoc networks In a mobile  Dr Qunwei Zheng is now with Cerqa 1309 Rutherford Ln

for the purpose   7  11  14  27 T he y e ither require initialization before deployment or provide only probabilistic guarantees Cryptographic approaches usually require additional computation time and bandwidth which could be expensive for nodes that are resource constrained Nodes can be compromised and a compromised node gives away all keys stored in its memory making communication not secure Cryptography cannot defend against adversaries that simply drop messages The multi-path approach splits a message into multiple shares and spreads them through multiple spacial disjoint 
paths to the destination Several related secure data transmission schemes have been proposed following the idea e.g using node-disjoint paths  16 M ultipath routing in MANET is used to select these paths  12  20 21 T hese schemes t well for scenarios where the space is large enough for the multiple paths to spread apart But they are not appropriate when a network is sparse or deployed in a restricted geographic area where not enough node-disjoint multiple paths can be found In our recent work  a temporal multi-path r outing has been proposed for secure transmission for appli 
cations that tolerate delay such as applications that suitable for delay-tolerant networks The scheme does not require encryption In the scheme a message is split into many shares and each share is sent one after another with a certain interval of delay The protocol assumes that underlying MANET routing protocol will nd a path for delivering a share In this scheme mobility helps to protect the conﬁdentiality in data transmission When 


2 sender or forwarders move in the network they’ll have different neighbor nodes This will decrease the chances that a series of shares will be eavesdropped by the same node over time who will be able to recover the original message In this paper we study one of the key design issues for the temporal multi-path based routing scheme namely how the source node decides when to send a share or multiple shares and what the associated risks are We focus on strategies that take into considerations of mobility and the application’s requirement on the total delay in receiving enough shares and reconstructing the original message Our analysis is based on a uniform distribution and random walk direction type of mobility Further we investigate through simulation how different mobility models affect the proposed temporal multi-path based routing scheme The results show useful insights on the practical aspect of the scheme and suggest that the strategies have analytical and practical signiﬁcance for the conﬁguration and the security of the scheme These results distinguish this work from the early work signiﬁcantly In all our proposed scheme provides a valuable alternative for delay tolerant applications to enhance message conﬁdentiality The paper is organized as follows Section II introduces the related work on security and mobility analysis An overview of the Time-Based Message Dissemination Scheme TBDS is given in Section III Analysis and strategies are presented in Section IV Simulation results are reported in Section V Section VI concludes the paper II R ELATED W ORK In recently years several schemes have been proposed which use the principle of multiple shares to achieve security in mobile ad hoc networks A secure data transmission scheme based on Rabin’s Information Dispersal Algorithm IDA w a s p roposed in 16 In this scheme dispersed message pieces are routed simultaneously through a set of node-disjoint paths The destination node reconstructs the message after receiving sufﬁcient pieces The authors discussed how the source can adjust the path set based on feedback from the destination so that the protocol can remain effective in an ever changing network A similar scheme that is based on Shamir’s secret sharing technique w a s p roposed in 13 M essage is divided into multiple shares and sent simultaneously through multiple independent paths The authors discussed how to split message so that maximum security can be obtained and how to design an effective multipath routing algorithm The SMT routing protocol  makes use of the redundancy and low-cost encoding of the available multi-pathes In t he authors p ropose a secure routing scheme in an untrustworthy environment which can detect the threat of malicious behavior and resist the attack of colluding malicious nodes Our scheme is different from the above work These schemes utilize spatial redundancy They can be used in scenarios where multi-path exists On the other hand our work uses temporal multi-path to secure data transmission It can be used in scenarios where delay can be tolerated or where multi-path does not exist or hard to nd as in a sparse network or in a restricted geographical area In addition the scheme of  requires link encryption between neighboring nodes the cost of which is high If there is no link layer encryption it will be easy for an adversary to compromise a message since it can hear all shares when it approaches the source Our scheme does not make such an assumption In addition this paper studies the strategies of sending the shares it can work with the early work for secure route discover Several early work have analyzed various mobility models to understand their spatial graph properties and relation to radio interferences These results help to demonstrate mobility’s impact on MANET performance and to improve protocol design In a mobility assisted information diffusion protocol is proposed where historical records of encountered nodes are analyzed and used in the protocol The paper analyzes how the expected number of encountered nodes changes over time The statistic properties of link lifetime link change interarrival time path duration etc are analyzed in   T he results are h elpful for d esigning efﬁcient proactive routing protocols The analysis on multi-path routing has been discussed in  3 Under the conditions of several available paths and corresponding probabilities of successful transmissions the paper provides analytical framework that nds the packet allocation policy to maximize the probability of reconstructing the original information at receiver III O VERVIEW OF T IME B ASED M ESSAGE D ISSEMINATION S CHEME The Time-Based Message Dissemination Scheme TBDS works for networks where adversary eavesdrops wireless transmissions passively T he attack ers d o not collude to monitor all the network trafﬁc They can not follow an active transmitting node continuously due to the lack of localization techniques and visual assistance and its own motion intension That means the adversary’s path is not correlated with any other node at a particular transmission interval 


3 An original message is divided into multiple shares using threshold secret sharing scheme before transmission Then each share is sent at different time instances through different paths Any MANET routing protocol works here to obtain the routing path for the speciﬁc time instance To divide a message a  k n  threshold secret sharing scheme  can be used w hich di vides a secret into n shares The secret can be reconstructed from k or more shares but with less than k shares absolutely no information about the secret is disclosed We also call it  k  n r k out of n secret share scheme Readers are referred to Shamir’s original paper  I n t his p aper  we also use the term a packet to mean a share Thus the promise of the scheme is that when an attacker hears less then k shares the message is safe Figure 1 shows that the source node S sends three shares at different times to the receiver R  The trajectories of both the source and the destination nodes are shown as well as the three possible different routing paths when S sends the three shares The success of the scheme relies on the assumption that intermediate nodes are different along the paths and in the surroundings of the intermediate nodes If the time interval between the shares is carefully conﬁgured the nodes relaying/overhearing shares are different with high probability such a scheme is secure and realistic Given the adversary model for any other node to acquire enough shares it must happen to be around or on enough relaying paths Since the node lacks the ability of persistent tracking its chance of hearing enough shares is very low This scheme does not speciﬁcally require cryptographic operations on message transmissions When a mobile network has built some security mechanisms it can co-exist with them and strengthen the security of message delivery The security of the time-based message dissemination scheme is analyzed based on nodes occurrences in geographic areas that surrounds the routing path using the radio transmission range Based on isotropic random walk mobility model the probabilities that a node can hear enough  k out of n  shares are negligible IV S ENDER S TRATEGY A NALYSIS In the time-based message dissemination scheme TBDS the key design issue is the selections of the time interval between sending two shares consecutively and the number of shares sending at each time instant The TBDS scheme makes use of paths at different times to transmit shares when the sender moves In other words one share or a few shares will be sent from the sender at different times until all the shares are sent Fig 1 TBDS transmission scheme The blue and red rectangles respectively represent the receiver and sender At each transmission period the sender will transmit a part of the shares to receiver The challenge is that the legitimate nodes can not detect eavesdroppers due to their passive attacking behavior Thus the sender will simply treat all the nodes other than the receiver as potential attackers Such an assumption makes the decision making at the sender extremely hard In this paper we explore intuitive hints and global knowledge to help design guidance to senders For example the sender could try to avoid a particular node to appear in its neighborhood too many times when it sends shares Such information can be obtained from its neighbor list More over without the knowledge about who is an adversary the sender will use the status of link changes which is an indication of network dynamics as a hint for security The probability of link change in a neighborhood will help us to infer the chance of being continuously eavesdropped and to construct a secure transmission scheme When there is a higher probability of link change during a certain time period there is a lower probability of being continuously eavesdropped and the sender could dispatch more packets Whereas less or no packet would be sent in the period There are two parameters in the scheme transmission interval T between two consecutive transmissions and the total delay Z The total delay Z is the time elapsed at the sender in sending all the shares from the rst to the last It will be divided into several transmission intervals each with a length of T  At the beginning of each interval a number of packets are sent depending on the strategies we discuss here We study two situations in this section 1 application has no demand on the upper bound of the total delay Z  and 2 application has a demand on the bound of the total delay Z  In the paper we assume that the nodes are uniformly distributed in the network and they follow the same mobility pattern We denote R to be the transmission range and  as the density of nodes in the network 


4 A Without delay bound Without a time limit on how long it should take to send all these shares the sender will choose to dispatch shares at times that it believes to be safe When the sender initiates a transmission it is reasonable to follow the rule that the more frequently the link changes the lower the probability of being eavesdropped by a certain adversary A few early work has studied the distribution of the link-change interarrival time and reported the result as approximate exponential expression with the mean link change rate   T hus t he probability of x link changes in time t is p x  t   t  x e   t   x   The parameter  can be obtained based on speed transmission radius and average density of nodes according to the paper  Thus the number of link change increases as the transmission interval extends As mentioned earlier the sender uses x  the number of link changes in its neighborhood as an indicator for the probability of secure transmission When such changes exceed a desired threshold set up by the sender it is relatively safe to send packets Let X be the threshold X  R 2  where  is the node density and  is the invariant ratio of the threshold i.e sender sends one or a few share each time after  percentage of the link change So the probability of being safe p s  t  isdeﬁned below when the number of link changes is not less than the threshold X  p s  t   p x  X  t   X  i 0  t  i e   t  i  1 In other words a longer interval brings more link changes and lower unsafe probabilities Given the number of link change threshold X  and assume P is the threshold for the probability of secure transmission we calculate the average transmission interval T below Set p s  t   P wehave 1  X  i 0  t  i e   t  i   P 2 Then the approximate result of t that satisﬁes the equation will be regarded as the transmission interval T  At the beginning of each interval T  the sender will send one packet until all the shares are sent The sender can choose to send a few packets but since total delay is not a concern sending one packet a time is safer According to the simulation of Random Waypoint Mobility model see Section V the estimated link change rate is around 0  25  We plot the calculated transmission intervals with relation to the rate the threshold of link 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Secure Probability Interval Link change rate at 0.25   1 link change 2 link change 3 link change Fig 2 Intervals at rate 0.25 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0 20 40 60 80 100 120   Three Link Change Secure Probability Interval    Link Change Rate at 0.1  Link Change Rate at 0.2 Link Change Rate at 0.3 Fig 3 Intervals at three changes change X and the security probability P in the Figures 2 and 3 In fact we can calculate link change rate  based on the instant velocity of the sender using the equations listed in  T hus w hen a node changes its speed its  will be different too In turn a new transmission interval T can be calculated for the next packet This interval dynamics is very useful for the sender to adjust the interval according to its own speed rather than estimating We have used our simulation conﬁguration to generate a similar curve  as those in  T he gure is not included due to space limit We further validate our expectation on the relationship of transmission interval vs the security through a simple simulation The simulation investigates the ability of an arbitrary node hearing enough shares We set threshold secret sharing as  k n 3  5  i.e a message is divided into 5 shares and hearing 3 or more shares will be able to recover the original message So here enough shares means 3 or more shares Three intervals and various mobility are tested Figure 4 shows that when transmission interval increases the percentage of hearing at least 3 shares drops It also shows that when node

Sensitive volume for earth orbiting spacecraft which transit thr ough the Van Allen belts is negligible compared to trapped protons. Most of the data presented used 150 mil shielding as indicated in Table 4  When other thicknesses, ranging from 150 mils to 400 mils were explored as shown in Table 5 less than a 17% change was observed in the predicted upset rate.  A minor difference between the observed and the predicted number of upsets for the majority of the programs analyzed indicates that the models are relatively accurate in predicting upset rates even after the SV and shielding assumptions were explored.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
