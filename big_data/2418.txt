Ubiquitous in\n?elds ranging from astronomy biology and web science the size\nand number of these datasets continues to increase, a situation\nexacerbated by the exponential growth of our digital footprints.\nThe prevalence and potential utility of this data has led to a vast\nnumber of time-series data mining techniques, many of which\nrequire symbolization of the raw time series as a pre-processing\nstep1 for which a number of well used, pre-existing approaches\nfrom the literature are typically employed. In this work we note\nthat these standard approaches are sub-optimal in \(at least broad application area of time series comparison leading\nto unnecessary data corruption and potential performance loss\nbefore any real data mining takes place. Addressing this we\npresent a novel quantizer based upon optimization of compar-\nison ?delity and a computationally tractable algorithm for its\nimplementation on big datasets. We demonstrate empirically that\nour new approach provides a statistically signi?cant reduction in\nthe amount of error introduced by the symbolization process\ncompared to current state-of-the-art. The approach therefore\nprovides a more accurate input for the vast number of data\nmining techniques in the literature, providing the potential of\nincreased real world performance across a wide range of existing\ndata mining algorithms and applications.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nTime series are an exceptionally common form of big data,\nfuelled by the increasing proportions of our daily lives that\nare logged and recorded. Research into how best to extract\nvalue from this data has produced an exceptional array of data\nmining techniques for classifying, clustering and predicting.\nHowever, a common pre-processing step in many of these is to\nconvert continuous time series into symbolic representations.\nThis is implemented for a variety of reasons: for big data it is\noften crucial due to computational and storage constraints, but\nit is also often used to reduce noise, enhance interpretation, or\nsimply to allow application of algorithms designed speci?cally\nfor discrete domains [1]–[3]. Due in part to the extensive use\nof symbolization, it is often thought of as a solved problem.\nWe will show in this paper that this is far from the case and\nthat current methods of symbolization are often not optimal\nfor the task they are being used for leading to information\nloss and performance degradation in many machine learning\nalgorithms.\n1for example over 90 recent data mining publications used Symbolic Ag-\ngregation Approximation \(SAX see http://www.cs.ucr.edu/?eamonn/SAX.\nhtm or quantization process equates to reducing reconstruction error\nwhich is optimized by minimizing the mean squared error\n\(MSE between the original time series and its quantized\nform2. But this only considers a single application signal\nreconstruction - and while MSE is optimal for that case, it\nis sub-optimal for a broad range of other applications. In\nparticular it is sub-optimal for the most common use of sym-\nbolized time series within data mining: time series similarity\nsearch. This seems an important oversight: similarity search is\nthe cornerstone of many important subproblems such as time\nseries clustering, classi?cation, motif discovery and anomaly\ndetection. We argue therefore that it is not reconstruction\n?delity of times series which should be of most concern, but\ncomparison ?delity. We develop this notion, resulting in a\nnovel quantization technique for data mining which we refer\nto as an Independent Comparison Error \(ICE experiments that our imple-\nmentation of ICE outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives \(to\nstatistically signi?cant levels and over a range of time series\nlengths and symbol set cardinalities being\nstrictly optimal due to simpli?cations invoked for purposes\ncomputational tractability. This approach provides the main\ncontribution of our paper, covering a wide range of real world\napplications and providing a theoretical underpinning upon\nwhich additional algorithms may be derived in the future.\nII. PROBLEM STATEMENT\nThis work considers the task of learning an optimal quan-\ntizer for univariate time series where the quantized data is\nthen used for time series comparisons. Univariate time series\nare an extremely common digital commodity with examples\nincluding measures of usage \(e.g. household energy or hourly\nwebsite traf?c measures of communication \(e.g. daily email\ntraf?c encoded, for example, as relative\ndisplacement  of actually quantizing\nthat time series with it - once a quantizer has been learnt it is\n2There are of course other proposed notions of good quantization includ-\ning the maximisation of symbol entropy \(e.g. the often used SAX method [1]\nand it’s subsequent re?nements [4], [5 classi?ers for signal detection.

First, the use of zero-\nmemory quantizers are exceptionally common in practice.\nSecond, and more importantly, the more complex cases can\ngenerally be viewed and implemented as extensions to the\nzero-memory univariate case, which therefore provides an\nideal theoretical basis and the obvious starting point to un-\nderpin the development and evaluation of a novel quantizer.\nAs further motivation for this decision, we point to the\nfact that extensions utilising temporal dependencies in time\nseries commonly apply linear pre-processing followed by zero-\nmemory scalar quantization 7, p.66] - and as such can also\nbe directly be applied to this work.\nA. De?ning a “good” quantization: Time series comparisons\nThe generalized quantization problem is instantiated within\nan application domain by an objective function which quan-\nti?es the notion of a good quantization. Note, however, there\nare large classes of applications for which a single objective\nfunction can be justi?ed. Speci?cally, here we consider the\nlarge class of applications which are based on time series\ncomparisons. For this class good translates to minimizing the\ncomparison error between any two time series, leading to the\nfollowing, previously unconsidered, de?nition of E :\nE\(T , Q Ta, Tb Qˆ\(Ta Tb 3 Ta, Tb series Ta and Tb\nand ?\(Qˆ\(Ta Tb Ta Tb While any distance measure\nis possible, in this work we consider the commonly chosen\nEuclidean distance as the measure of distance between time\nseries - and hence we intend to maintain, after quantization, as\ngood as an approximate as possible of the original Euclidian\ndistances between time series. Armed with this new objective\nfunction, the question therefore arises as to whether the current\nmethods, which are optimal for their original goals \(such as\nreconstruction SUBOPTIMALITY OF EXISTING QUANTIZERS FOR\nTIME SERIES COMPARISON\nAs previously noted, although a number of methods for\nquantizing time series have been proposed in the literature,\nnone have addressed the end goal of maintaining the ?delity\nof time series comparisons. This is surprising given, ?rst, the\nsubstantial literature on quantization for signal reconstruction,\nclassi?cation or maximization of human perception \(see [7],\n[8 9]–[11] and [12] respectively for examples is being reg-\nularly indexed and retrieved via computational comparisons.\nFor instance, the often cited SAX method for indexing time\nseries makes no consideration of the end goal of time series\ncomparison. This is despite its frequent use as part of k-\nnearest neighbour or range queries. Speci?cally, the quantizer\nembedded within SAX \(and additionally within iSAX [13],\niSAX 2.0 [5] and variants maximum\nentropy quantizer and does not consider data point values, but\nrather only their frequencies. As will be shown empirically\nlater in section V, this leads to the approach to symbolization\nperforming sub-optimally for time series comparisons, where\nevaluations occur based upon these values. This is not a\nspeci?c criticism of SAX, for which quantization is only one\ncomponent, rather it is a criticism of the lack of research into\nthe effect of quantization for the broad application of time\nseries comparison. Note that even in the recent work presented\nin [14] \(which providing valuable insights through the compar-\nison of different representation methods for time series data or alternatives the\ntype of quantization performed within the representations.\nWe provide below a concise review of current quantization\ntechniques. Under the sub-section Example of failure, we\nhighlight the sub-optimality for comparison based applications\nof each of these techniques via a counter-example, giving an\nexample where the method does not provide the best quantisa-\ntion with respect to maintaining the distance between two 


time\nseries. When applicable, we use an illustrative toy example\nTa = [10, 10, 4] and Tb = [10, 0, 4] where Tai, Tbi ? [0, 4, 10]\n647\nto highlight sub-optimality. Under optimal comparison quan-\ntization of these time-series into a binary alphabet, Ta and Tb\nbecome [10, 10, 10] and [10, 0, 10] respectively because such\nan encoding best preserves the Euclidean distance between\nthe two original time series of 10 \(minimizing equation 3 current techniques\nthemselves - all provide optimal solutions for some applica-\ntion. Rather the issue is in their erroneous application to data\nmining tasks which rely on time series comparisons, where a\nquantizer speci?cally designed for that purpose should have\nbeen preferred.\nA. Uniform quantization\nUniform quantization is by far the simplest form of time\nseries quantization and is simply the partitioning of all po-\ntential values into m equal regions. No information regarding\nthe distribution, values or end use are taken into account. The\ncentre point of each region is then assigned to any points in the\ntime series that fall into that region. The non-optimal nature of\nsuch an approach with respect to post-quantization time series\ncomparisons is easily seen by numerous toy examples.\nExample of failure: Under uniform quantization Ta, Tb are\nquantized to [7.5,7.5,2.5], [7.5,2.5,2.5] respectively resulting in\na distance of 5. This is only half the distance of 10, captured\nby the optimal encoding of [10, 10, 10] and [10, 0, 10].\nB. Minimal reconstruction error \(MSE mean squared error objective function minimizes the\nreconstruction error between the original and quantized time\nseries. Speci?cally, for a given set of time series the quanti-\nzation levels are selected so that the following error function\nE is minimized:\nE\(T , Q Tai ?Q\(Tai 4 not take into account how often\ncomparisons are made, nor adjust its quantization accordingly,\nas is shown in the example case:\nExample of failure: Under MSE, Ta, Tb are quantized to\n[10, 10, 3], [10, 3, 3], resulting in a separation distance of 7.\nWhile better than the uniform quantizer, again the optimal\nsolution, 10, is not achieved.\nC. Maximum Output Entropy \(MOE in-\nformation between the input and the output. If Y is the number\noutput levels in the resulting quantizer and m is the number\nof levels in the quantizer, then the average mutual information\nis maximized between the input and output of the quantizer\nwhen P \(Yk  amount of shannon information, an MOE\nquantization is not optimal when comparing post-quantized\ntime series under distance measures that penalize changes in\nthe amplitude. This is because the distance measure values\nlarge changes in magnitude far more than small changes. And\nsince an MOE quantizer’s only goal is only to maximise the\namount of per symbol information, and not the importance\nof that information to a speci?c task, it can signi?cantly\nunderperform when quantizing with respect to maintaining the\n?delity of a distance metric.\nExample of failure: Here we use a slightly more involved il-\nlustrative example. Consider series the time series: [0,0,0,0,-1,-\n1,-1,-1,50,60,70,80] and [-1,-1,-1,-1,0,0,0,0,80,70,60,50]. Un-\nder MOE with 3 symbols these quantize to [0,0,0,0,-1,-1,-\n1,-1,65,65,65,65] and [-1,-1,-1,-1,0,0,0,0,65,65,65,65 respec-\ntively. Calculating the distance between the quantized series\nproduces a results of 2.83, which is far below the actual\nEuclidean distance of 44.81 \(whereas the best possible result\nobtainable using a three level quantizer is in fact, the far closer\nvalue of 42.43 Aggregation Approximation is a time series rep-\nresentation that actually supports an arbitrary underlying quan-\ntizer [5, pg. 59] \(as denoted by Q in equation 1 to use a quantizer\nbased on MOE, but with the added assumption of a normal\ndistribution [1]. It is this quantizer variant used within SAX\nthat we consider, henceforth denoted as qSAX. Note we only\naddress the performance of this speci?c part of the SAX\nrepresentation, and not the other aspects such as temporal\nquantization or the ef?cient indexing of the symbolic repre-\nsentation addressed in subsequent publications \(e.g. extended\nSAX [4], iSAX [13] or iSAX 2.0 [5], which continue to use\nqSAX as the underlying quantizer SAX frameworks, allowing any performance\nimprovements we report to also bene?t these more involved\napproaches to working with time series data.\nExample of failure: Consider the same series as detailed for\nMOE. Under qSAX with 3 symbols both of the subject time-\nseries quantize to [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,65,65,65,65 This\nsurprising result is due to the assumption of a normal prior, and\nresults in a reported distance of 0 This is clearly suboptimal\nwhen the actual Euclidean distance is, as before, 44.81.\nE. Other quantizers\nOther quantizers proposed in the literature seek to minimize\nobjective functions speci?c to their individual problem spaces.\nFor instance perceptual distance quantizers aim to maximise\nthe ability to discriminate in the context of a binary decision\nwhere two hypotheses and associated conditional probabilities\n\(giving the probability of the input assuming a pre-speci?ed\nhypothesis is true  application speci?c knowledge, these approaches are\nnot applicable to the general class of time-series 


comparison\nproblems we consider. Other proposed quantizers have in-\ncluded perceptual distance quantizers which seek to quantize\nsuch that as much perceptual information is retained [17], and\nthe Persist algorithm 18] which aims to quantize such that the\nsymbols are persistent temporally with a focus on the human\n648\ninterpretability of the states. While approaching their speci?c\nproblems from a similar angle to ourselves, the end use, the\nproblems addressed, and the subsequent developments of a\ncustom quantizer, are very different to that presented here.\nIV. LEARNING IMPROVED QUANTIZERS FOR TIME SERIES\nCOMPARISON\nIn section III we discussed the fact that current state-of-\nthe-art solutions are not optimal with respect to the goal of\ncomparing time series. That this is the case is of no real\nsurprise since this prior work makes no claim to be optimal\nin this sense, nor do they even attempt to strive towards this\ntype of optimality. However, these techniques have been used\n\(perhaps deleteriously availability. In theory, therefore, such\napproaches to learning quantizers should be avoided in favour\nof those directly attempting to ?nd the optimal quantization\nwith respect to minimizing time series comparison error. Un-\nfortunately, enumerating all possible quantizers and selecting\nthe one with the lowest comparison error is intractable since\nsimply checking a solution has a runtime complexity quadratic\nin the number of time series multiplied by the time series\nlength.\nAddressing this issue we now present a novel alternative\napproach which we have named Independent Comparison\nError quantization \(ICE simulated annealing, for which we provide an excep-\ntionally cheap to compute error function based on equation\n3. Speci?cally, our error function enables a solution to be\nchecked in O\(m2 of the number and\nlength of the time series making it particularly applicable to\nbig datasets. This tractability is gained through the introduction\nof two approximations/assumptions, coupled with a speci?c re-\nformulation of the problem and an integrated caching strategy.\nRecall from equation 2 that our goal in learning a quantizer\nis to minimize comparison error, argminQ T , Q respect to a reconstruction error\nfunction, then we could have used one of a number of algo-\nrithms that provide a computationally tractable deterministic\nsolution [19] \(in practice, the stochastic Max-Lloyd algorithm\n[8] still predominates, due to its computational ef?ciency and\nin spite of the fact that it may return only a locally optimal\nsolution comparison error \(i.e. equation 3 rather than choice method\n\(in similar fashion to [20] who minimized reconstruction\nerror in the case of vector quantization Speci?cally, our\noptimization approach is based upon a modi?cation of the\nalgorithm detailed in [21], which implements a basic simulated\nannealing algorithm in a parallel fashion on the GPU, thus\nenabling a far greater search space to be considered.\nIn implementing a simulated annealing approach, a state\nwithin the system is de?ned as a speci?c instance of a quan-\ntizer Q as de?ned in equation 1. The cost function is an error\n3recall that m is the number of output symbols produced by the quantizer,\nand is assumed to be relatively small.\nfunction \(E\(T , Q valid permutations of\nboundary and symbol values being used as the next neighbour\nfunction. In order to ensure that this approach is tractable,\nthe cost of checking each potential solution must be very low\ndue to the vast size of the space that must be iterated through.\nTherefore, checking equation 3 directly is simply not an option\ndue to its quadratic complexity in the number of time series\nand their length, leading to computational intractability. As\nsuch, we present a solution to this problem via a re-formulation\nof the error function which is able to reduce the cost of\nchecking a solution to being quadratic only in the number\nof symbols quantized to, m. Since m is typically small the\nquadratic nature is not a concern. Importantly, we are now\nindependent of both the number and length of the time series.\nNote that when the assumptions we present hold exactly,\nthe learnt quantizer is guaranteed to be optimal. Although\nsituations where they do hold perfectly are unlikely to occur\nwithin real world datasets, we show empirically in section\nV via real world data that even when these assumptions\nare moderately violated the learnt quantizer still performs\nextremely well.\nA. A novel quantizer for time series comparisons\nConsider using the error function from equation 3 as the\ncost function in the simulated annealing, instantiated with the\nstandard Euclidean distance as previously motivated \(letting n\nand N denote the length of an individual time series and the\nnumber of time series respectively T , Q  Tbi that the terminology error function and cost function\nis interchangeable here since they have the same functional\nform. Speci?cally, just like E\(T , Q series set and evaluates a\n?xed instantiation of a quantizer, Q, in this case corresponding\nto a state within the simulating annealing algorithm.\nAs previously discussed, using this equation directly as the\ncost function within the simulated annealing process via a\nbrute force computation is intractable. In order to 


achieve\ntractability we reconsider our choice of the Euclidean distance\nas the distance function substituting it with the Manhattan\ndistance. The rational for utilising the Manhattan distance\nis purely pragmatic4, allowing the subsequent reformulations\npresented in this work \(when considering applications which\nare inextricably tied to L2 metrics this change can be consid-\nered a practical approximation selected the Manhat-\ntan distance the error \(cost T , Q n?\n?Ta,Tb?T\n?????\nn?\ni=1\n|Tai ? Tbi| ?\nn?\ni=1\n|Q\(Tai Tbi distance is an equally good choice\nin end use tasks such as classi?cation [22] and hence is worth optimising for\nin its own right.\n649\nSince the order of the elementwise comparisons considered\nis not of a concern within the distance measure each member\nof T can be modelled as a random variable, and assuming the\ntime series are all of the same length, the above equation can\nbe rewritten as:\nE\(T , Q Ta = x Tb = y Ta = x, Tb = y x y to:\nn\n?\n?Ta,Tb\n?T\n????\n?? ?\n??\nP \(Ta=x, Tb=y y Ta = x, Tb = y empirical probability that a\nparticular value in Ta will be compared with a particular value\nin Tb when the time series are examined against each other.\nUnfortunately, even in this form we still need to calculate the\nempirical probabilities between each pair of time series, and\nare facing a time complexity quadratic in the total number of\ntime series within our dataset. Therefore, we take the further\nstep of bringing the outer modulus within the integration itself,\nas this allows us to make the logical interpretation of our\noverall error function as being the sum of the magnitude of\nthe per time series element comparison errors. The validity\nof making this adjustment is sound for time series of low\nlength \(it is identical for time series of length one sign changes within component\nparts of the integration will occur, producing unpredictable\ninteraction effects. The assumption here, therefore, is that these\nsign changes do not occur. While this is highly unlikely to\nbe true in general, our empirical results indicate that this\nformulation still provides a good approximation of the desired\nobjective function in practice. At the same time we divide\nby the constant n × N2 the manipulation of the equation\nvia constants will not change the resultant optimisation proposed error \(cost T , Q Ta=x, Tb=y x y dy\nwhich can be rearranged to:\n?? ?\n??\n1\nN2\n?\n?Ta,Tb\n?T\nP \(Ta=x, Tb=y x y x y series\ncomparisons in T we get:\n\(5 T , Q x, y x y re-arrangement of the proposed function\nthat we primarily refer to as Independent5 Comparison Error\n\(ICE now provide a tractable, O\(m2 annealing\nalgorithm.

Importantly,\nthe ICE quantizer also followed this trend, showing the validity\nof approximation of the comparison error used in practice.\nWhile ICE provided the best performance on all experi-\nments using real-world data, its performance was less marked\nwhen quantizing with 8 symbols \(with MSE and qSAX still\nproviding strong competition at this level Social Science Data Archive: http://www.ucd.\nie/issda/data/commissionforenergyregulationcer/\n10Available from http://horatio.cs.nyu.edu/mit/tiny/data/index.html\n\(a 8 16 24\nICE 0.2295 \(0.0160 0.0154 0.0241 0.0155 0.0181 0.0248 0.0279 0.0446 0.0274 0.0268 0.0208 0.0246 0.0034 0.0048 0.0092 0.0147 0.0199 0.0164 b 0.0168 0.0154 0.0189 0.0181 0.0180 0.0184 0.0311 0.0483 0.0294 0.0177 0.0186 0.0198 0.0057 0.0087 0.0136 0.0163 0.0222 0.0209 c series of length 96\nNum Syms: 8 16 24\nICE 0.3894 \(0.0214 0.0221 0.0218 0.0163 0.5235 \(0.0103 0.1208 0.0133 0.0411 0.0420 0.0289 0.4993 \(0.0303 0.0214 0.0064 0.0088 0.0068 0.0161 0.0160 0.0169 d 0.0222 0.6569 \(0.0192 0.0225 0.0180 0.0199 0.0160 0.0216 0.5255 \(0.0507 0.0313 0.0300 0.0333 0.0279 0.0057 0.0404 \(0.0103 0.0079 0.0438 0.0256 0.0325 e Time series of length 24\nNum Syms: 8 16 24\nICE 0.2233 \(0.0192 0.0197 0.0270 0.0109 0.0199 0.0220 0.0361 0.0608 0.1129 0.0186 0.0220 0.0128 0.0124 0.0154 0.0208 0.0214 0.0263 0.0185 f 24\nICE 0.3024 \(0.0230 0.0196 0.0189 0.0177 0.0213 0.0142 0.0189 0.1214 0.1270 0.0228 0.0249 0.0220 0.0140 0.0190 0.0183 0.0288 0.0244 0.0195 g 0.0174 0.0172 0.0161 0.0198 0.0259 0.0165 0.0204 0.0814 0.1271 0.0253 0.0162 0.0177 0.0110 0.0124 0.0176 0.0178 0.0196 0.0210 MEAN \(STDEV METHOD\(S 


FROM\nTHE BEST \(p < 0.05 comparisons\nbegin to occur with same frequency and hence the advantages\nof ICE become less pronounced.\nFor our synthetic random-walk dataset ICE again generally\nprovided the best performance - but this time the results could\nnot be con?rmed to a statistically signi?cant level, even for\nlarger symbol sets. Note that in general the synthetic data\nprovided an easier task, with almost all methods performing\nbetter than for the real world energy data when quantizing\nto the same number of symbols. A potential explanation is\nthat the nature of the random walk means that the time series\nare more spread out in the space11, and hence it is easier to\ndiscriminate between time series in general. This results in\nless re?ned symbolizations \(with respect to comparisons closing the gap on the ICE quantizer\nas shown in the results. Finally, note that in this dataset the\nsymbol distributions for the time series are Gaussian, and this\nhelps promote the effectiveness of qSax.\nIt is worth also noting that aMSE \(which used the same core\nsimulated annealing algorithm as ICE, varying only the cost\nfunction chosen value of 900 for\nthe approximation of the continuous space in the GPU methods\nwas of an appropriate granularity. A ?nal observation is with\nregard to the poor performance of the MOE and Uniform\nquantizers Their consistent losses, and general inability to\nidentify the majority of nearest neighbours correctly, serve to\nhighlight that the consideration of quantization approach can\nbe vital to the effectiveness of data mining algorithms.\nVII. CONCLUSIONS\nMany quantization techniques which are thought of as\noptimal, are in fact only optimal within the context of a speci?c\nproblem domain such as signal reconstruction. In this work we\nhave shown that in the extremely prevalent case where quan-\ntized input is used as the basis for time-series comparisons,\nstandard approaches can lead to potential performance loss. To\naddress this issue we have presented a novel quantizer \(ICE computationally tractable implementation\neffective to large data. Our empirical results based upon three\ndifferent datasets \(and using various time-series lengths and\nsymbol-set cardinalities initial evidence for the\nsuperiority of ICE for comparison-based data mining tasks.\nEven though one might expect the assumptions that underpins\nICE to be violated by many real-world datasets, our results\nhave indicated that even when such violations occur our\nquantizer can still provide superior performance to current\nstate-of-the-art quantization approaches.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis work was funded by the RCUK Horizon Digital\nEconomy Research Hub grant, EP/G065802/1.\n11The variance in the pairwise distances between the original time series\nin the random walk dataset was over double that of the electricity dataset.\nREFERENCES\n[1] J.

This is because the \ntime in preparation may be very low while the time in space \nmay be very long. If the preparation period will be less than \nseveral weeks then sampling frequency should be ncontinuous or as continuous as feasible . If the preparation \nperiod for launch will occur over many weeks then the \nsampling frequency can be reduced to once/hour. \nIn general, the shorter the preparation time for launch the \nhigher the data sampling frequency is required. Preferably, \nprelaunch activity biological diagnostic data should be \nrecorded continuously and the data available for merging \nwith launch and on-orbit data. After a person initially \narrives in space, the sampling frequency should be \ncontinuous or near continuous . After the person has been in \nspace for several weeks, the sampling frequency can be \nreduced to once/hour. If a person is in space for several \nmonths, the sampling frequency can be reduced to as little \nas once/6 hours . \nTable 2.

CONCLUSION \nA prognostic and health management \(PHM industry telemetry to collect, store and distribute \nto remote locations the biological, diagnostic information \nfor process for predicting mental illness using with \npredictive algorithms .  The predictive algorithms are often \nproprietary and must be developed for use with aerospace \ntelemetry to compensate for the many shortcomings and \ncomplexities of CCSDS telemetry to be accurate and \nreliable. Our proprietary predictive algorithms were \npioneered on the Air Force's GPS satellites and Atlas launch \nvehicles over 30 years ago. They have also been \nsuccessfully used on other military, NASA and commercial \nsatellites, launch vehicles and missiles to illustrate the \npresence of accelerated aging in normal appearing \nequipment telemetry from completely normal behaving \nequipment. \nA behavior of a person ' s  FOFR can explain the cause ntreatment and the cure for mental illness .  The chemicals \n1 8  \nreleased by the FOFR when activated were developed by the \nFOFR to be in the body an extremely short duration. \nToday's  lifestyle has forced people to remain in threatening \nsituations forcing the presence of the toxic chemicals used \nby the FOFR for self preservation to be present for many \nyears at varying levels. The chemicals released by the FOFR \nand release of chemicals that are created as a result of the \nrelease of adrenaline and cortisol cause accelerated aging on \nthe entire body including all areas of the brain. When the \nFOFR is damaged from accelerated aging, it forces the \nbrain 's  chemistry to be altered by changing the ratios of \nthree main chemicals very, causing mental illness .  All the \nmedications used in mental health treat only the symptoms \nof mental illness and do not cure it. \nThe identification of accelerated aging in biological, \ndiagnostic telemetry can be used by ground personnel to \npredict the mental illness in personnel to be used for deep \nspace missions. The model of the brain' s  FOFR subsystem \nprovides the information necessary for the ground crew to \npredict and thus prevent mental illness from occurring by \nmaking the changes to the person ' s  environment. The PHM \nuses information obtained from a variety of mission phases \nincluding pre-launch readiness, launch and during deep nspace travel to develop baseline behavior from which \nmental illness can predicted so it can be prevented nREFERENCES \n[ 1 ] .

specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
