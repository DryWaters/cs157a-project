optimization for larger transaction sizes and in cases where there are large number of candidate k itemsets 6 Conclusions In this paper e presented a parallel implementation of the Apriori algorithm on the SGI Power Challenge shared memory multi-processor We also discussed a set of optimizations which include optimized join and pruning computation balancing for candidate generation hash tree balancing and short-circuited subset checking We then presented experimental results on each of these Improvements of more than 40 were obtained for the computation and hash tree balancing The short-circuiting optimization was found to be extremely effective for databases with large transaction sizes Finally we reported the parallel performance of the algorithm While we d good speed-up we observed a need for parallel I/O techniques for further performance gains References  R Agra wal T  Imielinski and A Swami Database mining A performance perspecti v e  I n IEEE Trans on Knowledge and Data Engg  pages 5\(6 1993  R Agra wal T  Imielinski and A Swami Mining association rules between sets of items in lar ge databases In Proc M SIGMOD Intl Conf Management of Data  May 1993  R Agra wal H Mannila R Srikant H T o i v onen and A I V erkamo F ast disco v ery of association rules In U F et al editor Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining  MIT Press 1996  R Agra wal and J Shafer  P arallel mining of association rules design implementation and e xperience Technical Report RJ10004 IBM Almaden Research Center San Jose CA 95120 Jan 1996  R Agra wal and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In Proc 20th VLDB Conf  Sept 1994  M Cierniak W  Li and M J Zaki Loop scheduling for heterogeneity  I n 4th IEEE Intl Symposium on High-Performance Distributed Computing also as URCS-TR 540 CS Dept Univ f Rochester  Aug 1995  M Holsheimer  M  K ersten H Mannila and H T o i v onen A perspecti v e on databases and data mining In 1st Intl Conf Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining  Aug 1995  M Houtsma and A Swami Set-oriented mining of association rules In RJ 9567  IBM Almaden Oct 1993  H Mannila H T o i v onen and I V erkamo Ef 336cient algorithms for disco v ering association rules In AAAI Wkshp Knowledge Discovery in Databases  July 1994  J S P ark M Chen and P  S Y u  A n e f fecti v e hash based algorithm for mining association rules In Proc M SIGMOD Intl Conf Management of Data  May 1995 17 Proceedings of the 1996 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing \(SC\22296 0-89791-854-1/96 $ 10.00 ACM
