And this point is the subject of this paper, under the condition of enough statistical data, which econom ical characteristics will be brought out  
In order t o  f i nd out t h e i ndust r i a l charact e ri st i c s and development trend of radio and TV industry in China, the developing course of this industry has been anal ysi s f r om l abor product i v i t y based on cont rast i ve anal ysi s and di agrammat i c anal ysi s By compari s on t o  three major industries, the developing rapidly and hopef u l road has been exposed, and bef o re i t has not  received adequate recognition to itself.

SUBSTEP 2.3: Calculate the suitability value suitability  C q using the formula defined in Section 3; set it as the first objective value of C q  SUBSTEP 2.4: For each R jk 1   j   m 1   k   I j  and for each minimum support value ms g 1   g    h check whether count jk  is larger than or equal to the minimum support value ms g If R jk  satisfies the above condition, set   1 g ms q L    1 g ms q L 1, where   1 g ms q L  is the number of large 1-itemsets obtained by using the set of membership functions in chromosome C q and the minimum support value ms g let   h g ms q q g L C totalNumL1 1 1     as the second objective value of C q  STEP 3: Rank the chromosomes according to the two objectives suitability  C q d totalNumL1  C q  by the following substeps SUBSTEP 3.1: Set the variable r for representing the current rank, which is initially at 0 SUBSTEP 3.2: Find the non-dominated chromosomes among the un-ranked ones in the population, set r  r 1, and set the ranking values of the non-dominated chromosomes as r  SUBSTEP 3.3: If there still exist un-ranked chromosomes in the population, go to SUBSTEP 3.2; otherwise, do the next step STEP 4: The fitness value of each chromosome is then calculated based on the ranking value by the following substeps SUBSTEP 4.1: Calculate the fitness values of the chromosomes with their ranking values equal to one as follows f  C q  DomonatedBy  C q   P 1 where DominatedBy  C q s the number of chromosomes dominated by the chromosome C q and P is the population size SUBSTEP 4.2: Calculate the fitness values of the chromosomes with their ranking values larger than one as follows    q p p C dominates C and P C p q C f C f   1    where f  C p s the fitness value of chromosome C p which dominates chromosome C q and the constant value 1 is used to ensure the fitness values of dominated chromosomes are larger than those of non-dominated ones STEP 5: Calculate the average fitness values of the chromosomes with the same ranking values such that each of them can be selected equally by the selection strategy STEP 6: Copy the chromosomes with their ranking values equal to one into the non-dominated set NDS and remove the chromosomes which are dominated by other chromosomes in NDS  STEP 7: Execute the crossover operation on the population STEP 8: Execute the mutation operation on the population STEP 9: Calculate the fitness values of the new chromosomes by STEPs 2 to 8 STEP 10: Use the selection operation to choose appropriate individuals from the set of NDS to form the next generation. Here, the selection strategy can be elitist or roulette wheel. If the size of NDS called NDSSize is less than population size PSize all the chromosomes in NDS are copied into next population and the number PSize  NDSSize chromosomes are selected from the difference set of the offspring chromosomes and the current NDS  STEP 11: If the termination criterion is not satisfied go to Step 6; otherwise, do the next step STEP 12: Execute the truncation operator is used on the non-dominated set NDS to find the best k  solutions. Since there may be more than one chromosome kept in NDS the goal of this step is to keep the k representative solutions at the Pareto front. Note that this step is optional STEP 13: Mine fuzzy association rules from the given database and based on the derived chromosomes in NDS or the k representative chromosomes if STEP 12 is applied\, where each chromosome represents a set of membership functions. The fuzzy mining algorithm proposed in i s t h en  adopted to achieve this purpose for each set of membership functions STEP 14: Output the non-dominated set NDS and their corresponding fuzzy association rules  5. Experimental results  In this section, experiments made to show the performance of the proposed approach are described They were implemented in Java on a personal computer with Intel Pentium IV 3.20 GHz and 512 MB RAM. 64 items and 10000 transactions were used in the experiments. The dataset followed the exponential distribution. The initial population size P is set at 50 the crossover rate p c is set at 0.8, and the mutation rate p m is set at 0.001. The parameter d of the crossover operator is set at 0.35 according to Herrera et al s paper an d t h e s e t of  m i n i m u m su pport v a l u es i s  3%, 4%, , 13%}. The experiments were first made for demonstrating the evolution of the Pareto fronts by 


the proposed approach. The evolution of the Pareto fronts along with different generations by the proposed approach is shown in Figure 6             Figure 6. The evolution of the Pareto fronts From Figure 6, it can be observed that the solutions were distributed on the Pareto fronts in different generations. Besides, the final solutions \(after 500 generations\were better than those in other generations. Since the data distribution followed the exponential distribution, the solutions on the Pareto fronts were a little narrow. The proposed approach is thus effective in finding an appropriate set of solutions  6. Conclusion and future works  In this paper, we have proposed a multi-objective genetic-fuzzy mining algorithm for extracting membership functions from quantitative transactions for the SSFM problem. Two objective functions namely suitability and totalNumL1 have been used to find the Pareto-front solutions. Experimental results also show that the proposed approach is effective in finding the Pareto-front solutions. In the future, we will continuously enhance the multi-objective genetic-fuzzy approach for more complex problems, such as for solving the MSFM problem  7.

Conclusions  Through several comprehensive experiments, we found that the FCET and IFECT can save a larger amount of storage spaces than Apriori, MaxEclat, and CHARM in both SPARSE databases and DENSE databases. Since the FCET stores fewer elements for a long pattern, when matched with GMFI/GMAR algorithm, it also revealed efficient execution time than BASIC and CUMULATE in mining generalized association rules The time complexity to find the maximal itemsets is O\(log2n\ where n is the total number of maximal itemsets. For a long pattern, we used a partition tree to count the SUB_TID of itemsets, and then got their merged results. Although the memory required for the FCET is still exponentially large, through limiting the size of maximal itemsets and the size of clustering to a reasonable memory requirement, we do save a large amount of storage spaces, especially in dense databases  7.

Time Complexity and Speed We now evaluate scalability and speed with large high dimensional data sets to only compute the models as shown in Figure 7 The plotted times include the time to store models on disk but exclude the time to mine frequent itemsets We experimentally prove 1 Time complexity to compute models is linear on data set size 2 Sparse vector and matrix computations yield efÞcient algorithms whose accuracy was studied before 3 Dimensionality has minimal impact on speed assuming average transaction size T is small Transactions are clu stered with Incremental Kmeans 26 introduced on Sectio n 3 Large transaction les were created with the IBM synthetic data generator 3 ha ving defaults n 1 M T=10 I=4 Figure 7 shows time complexity to compute the clustering model The rst plot on the left shows time growth to build the clustering with a data set with one million records T10I4D1M As can be seen times grow linearly as n increases highlighting the algorithms efÞciency On the other hand notice d has marginal impact on time when it is increased 10-fold on both models due to optimized sparse matrix computations The second plot on the right in Figure 7 shows time complexity to compute clustering models increasing k on T10I4D100k Remember k is the main parameter to control support estimation accuracy In a similar manner to the previous experiments times are plotted for two high dimensionalities d  100 and d 1  000 As can be seen time complexity is linear on k  whereas time is practically independent from d  Therefore our methods are competitive both on accuracy and time performance 4.5 Summary The clustering model provides several advantages It is a descriptive model of the data set It enables support estimation and it can be processed in main memory It requires the user to specify the number of clusters as main input parameter but it does not require support thresholds More importantly clusters can help discovering long itemsets appearing at very low support levels We now discuss accuracy In general the number of clusters is the most important model characteristic to improve accuracy A higher number of clusters generally produces tighter bounds and therefore more accurate support estimations The clustering model quality has a direct relationship to support estimation error We introduced a parameter to improve accuracy wh en mining frequent itemsets from the model this parameter eliminate spurious itemsets unlikely to be frequent The clustering model is reasonably accurate on a wide spectrum of support values but accuracy decreases as support decreases We conclude with a summary on time complexity and efÞciency When the clustering model is available it is a signiÞcantly faster mechanis m than the A-priori algorithm to search for frequent itemsets Decreasing support impacts performance due to the rapid co mbinatorial growth on the number of itemsets In general the clustering model is much smaller than a large data set O  dk  O  dn  A clustering model can be computed in linear time with respect to data set size In typical transaction data sets dimensionality has marginal impact on time 5 Related Work There is a lot of

for data streams with the support of recent and old itemsets this approach relies on discrete algorithms for efÞcient frequency computation instead of using machine learning models like our proposal

constrained frequent itemset search are NP-hard and they are at least P-hard meaning t hey will remain intractable even if P=NP This work gives evidence it is not a good idea to mine all frequent itemsets above a support threshold since the output size is combinatorial In 13 t h e a ut hors d eri v e a bound on the number of candidate itemsets given the current set of frequent itemsets when using a level-wise algorithm Covers and bases 37 21 a re an alternati v e t o s ummarize association rules using a comb inatorial approach instead of a model Clusters have some resemblance to bases in the sense that each cluster can be used to derive all subsets from a maximal itemset The model represents an approximate cover for all potential associations We now discuss closely related work on establishing relationships between association rules and other data mining techniques Preliminary results on using clusters to get lower and upper bounds for support is given in 27  I n g eneral there is a tradeoff between rules with high support and rules with high conÞdence 33 t h i s w o rk propos es an al gorithm that mines the best rules under a Bayesian model There has been work on clustering transactions from itemsets 41  H o w e v er  t hi s a pproach goes i n t he oppos i t e di rection it rst mines associations and from them tries to get clusters Clustering association rules rather than transactions once they are mined is analyzed in 22  T he out put is a summary of association rules The approach is different from ours since this proposal works with the original data set whereas ours produces a model of the data set In 42 the idea of mining frequent itemsets with error tolerance is introduced This approach is related to ours since the error is somewhat similar to the bounds we propose Their algorithm can be used as a means to cluster transactions or perform estimation of query selectivity In 39 t he aut hors explore the idea of building approximate models for associations to see how they change over time 6 Conclusions This article proposed to use clusters on binary data sets to bound and estimate association rule support and conÞdence The sufÞcient statistics for clustering binary data are simpler than those required for numeric data sets and consist only of the sum of binary points transactions Each cluster represents a long itemset from which shorter itemsets can be easily derived The clustering model on high dimensional binary data sets is computed with efÞcient operations on sparse matrices skipping zeroes We rst presented lower and upper bounds on support whose average estimates actual support Model-based support metrics obey the well-known downward closure property Experiments measured accuracy focusing on relative error in support estimations and efÞciency with real and synthetic data sets A clustering model is accurate to estimate support when using a sufÞciently high number of clusters When the number of clusters increases accuracy increases On the other hand as the minimum support threshold decreases accuracy also decreases but at a different rate depending on the data set The error on support estimation slowly increases as itemset length increases The model is fairly accurate to discover a large set of frequent itemsets at multiple support levels Clustering is faster than A-priori to mine frequent itemsets without considering the time to compute the model Adding the time to compute the model clustering is slower than Apriori at high support levels but faster at low support levels The clustering model can be built in linear time on data size Sparse matrix operations enable fast computation with high dimensional transaction data sets There exist important research issues We want to analytically understand the relationship between the clustering model and the error on support estimation We need to determine an optimal number of clusters given a maximum error level Correlation analysis and PCA represent a next step after the clustering model but the challenges are updating much larger matrices and dealing with numerical issues We plan to incorporate constraints based on domain knowledge into the search process Our algorithm can be optimized to discover and periodically refresh a set of association rules on streaming data sets References 1 C  A ggar w al and P  Y u F
