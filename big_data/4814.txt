injections in user-based recommendation systems A core step in this process consists in mining infrequent combinations of user ratings on items e.g movies books music and so on With this purpose we have introduced a variation of our previous algorithm G3PARM that is specially devoted to rare association rule mining Since G3PARM is an evolutionary algorithm that uses G3P we have taken advantage of some important characteristics aforementioned such as its adaptability to the scope of application as well as its scalability which allows it to face up to large datasets comprising a great deal of attributes or items Precisely this latter point is an usual shortcoming of current attack detection proposals The attack probability   and the 015\012 measure used in the analysis of the rating patterns allows us to extract the suspicious attacked items state the real inuence of these items and nally extract the target item that the attacker promoted In our experiments both the attacked items and some ller items were catalogued as suspicious but the ller items are discarded later thanks to the inuence measure As a future work we plan to test different types of attacks because CRD are susceptible to a wide range of attacks In this respect we will be able to prove our new detection process in more complex attack injections like the bandwagon attack Although most of the current proposals analyzed datasets with attacks we also propose to explore how this method would react in non-simulated environments i.e where the increment of the dataset presents both usual rating proles and attacker proles A CKNOWLEDGMENT This work has been supported by Spanish Research Projects P08-TIC-3720 TIN2008-06681-C06-03 and FEDER founds R EFERENCES  F  Zhang L Bai and F  Gao AU s er Tru s

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
