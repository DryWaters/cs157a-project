INTRODUCTION \nWith the recent advent of commercial space flight, it is clear \nthat the ongoing move towards Commercial-Off-The-Shelf \n\(COTS hardware will only accelerate. Aerospace \nelectronics must simultaneously meet the goals of reduced \ncost increased performance, and reduced size and mass. \nModern commercial ASIC processes with Extreme- \nEnvironment potential are the perfect bridge between COTS \ncost and engineering benefits, and Aerospace performance nrequirements.  \nSilicon Germanium \(SiGe mixed-signal circuitry \ncapable of operation at cryogenic temperatures [1] [2]. The \nultimate solution however, will be process-agnostic, \nmatching different IC fabrication processes to the \nenvironment in which they are most useful. Interface \ncircuits must allow different processes to work together both \nlocally and across environmental boundaries such as inside \nand outside a Warm Box. This paper describes such an ninterface: a point-to-point clockless data-transmission \nsystem in High-Temperature Silicon-on-Insulator HTSOI OVER EXTREME TEMPERATURE AND \nRADIATION  \nHTSOI Process Description \nHigh-Temperature Silicon-On-Insulator HTSOI radiation-resistant compared with \nbulk silicon processes, and high-temperature versions are nthreshold-adjusted to function up to 225°C. Furthermore, to \nminimize electromigration, high-temperature processes \ngenerally have feature sizes of 0.7?m and larger. The \ncombination of large feature size, bulk isolation, and \nincreased VTH make HTSOI rad-hard-by-process. \nThe HTSOI chosen for this project, X-FAB’s XI10 process, \nis a 1 ?m, partially-depleted SOI process designed for a 5 V \nsupply. The N- and P-channel thresholds are set at 1.65 V \nand -1.25 V, respectively, to minimize leakage at high \ntemperatures. Both N and P-channel devices offer a \ncompact variation and a more-linear variation. The compact \nvariation features a body connection integrated into the \nsource region, and exhibits a non-constant channel width but \nis perfectly suitable for digital circuits. The more-linear \nvariation includes separate body ties providing a constant \nchannel width, and is recommended for analog circuits.  \nAlthough not used in this system, the XI10 process also \noffers LDMOS devices capable of blocking voltages of 100 \nV, and much higher voltage devices have been \ndemonstrated, making it useful for power management and \nvoltage isolation functions as well [3 4]. \n  2 \n \nFigure 1 – NAND gate functionality verified from -180° C to 23° C \nModel Extensions to Cryogenic Temperatures \nThe models delivered with the XI10 Process Design Kit \n\(PDK state-of-the-art at the time \nthe process was developed. These models support \nsimulation from -55° C to 225 C. As a first step to \nexpanding the temperature range down to -180° C, these \nmodels were updated to BSIM4-SOI, which has a parameter \nset that is backwards-compatible with BSIM3-SOIPD.  \nCircuits previously fabricated by another group in the XI10 \nprocess were available to confirm the validity of the \nextended simulation range [5]. Several circuit blocks were \ntested at cryogenic temperatures and compared with nsimulations. One example, a NAND gate, is shown in \nFigure 1.  \nA comparison of the parameter trends extrapolated from the \nmeasurements to the behavior of the BSIM4-SOI models \nshowed strong correlation down to 150° C without having \nto modify model parameters. Correlation from -150° C to    \n-175° C was not as strong but was clearly sufficient for \ndigital circuits. Models with the existing BSIM3-SOIPD \nparameters did not consistently converge at the -180° C \nsimulation step. Dedicated test structures have been \ndesigned and are 


in fabrication for further improvements to \nthe BSIM4-SOI parameter set. \n \nTotal-Ionizing-Dose and Single-Event-Transient Simulation \n The effect of radiation Total-Ionizing-Dose \(TID and shift the VTH of a transistor. This \neffect can be well-modeled by a 2\nnd\n order polynomial added \nto the BSIM4-SOI model. The input is an additional model \nparameter for TID with a default value of 0 Mrad nequivalent to a newly-manufactured device. The coefficients \nfor the equation were derived from radiation data for \nHoneywell’s 0.7? Partially-Depleted HTSOI process since it \nis very similar to the XI10 process [6 n \n \nFigure 2 – The Double Exponential SET model is sufficient for 1?m devices \n \n  3 \nIn addition to TID, the Single Event Transient \(SET can be placed at one or more locations within the \ncircuit as shown in Figure 2. Event time and Linear Energy nTransfer \(LET  nIntroduction to NCL \nAs utilized in this work, NULL Convention Logic \(NCL Insensitive Asynchronous Logic. \nUnlike Boolean logic, NCL contains three valid states: \nTRUE, FALSE, and NULL, coded as 10, 01, and 00. The \nTRUE and FALSE states are collectively DATA, and the 11 \nstate is undefined. Instead of having a clock signal, NCL \nconsists of pipelined stages. Figure 3 shows a generalized nstage structure consisting of Delay-Insensitive \(DI path, and \ncompletion detection logic in the feedback path between the \nDI registers. The simplest analogy for the pipeline stage is \nto consider it as a gated ring-oscillator, which self-\nsynchronizes with the surrounding ring oscillators [8]. \nAt the beginning of a cycle, the right DI register in a stage \nhas a forward-path output of NULL, a Ko output of logic 1 \nor request-for-DATA \(rfd nrequest-for-NULL \(rfn of rfn. At \nthe start time, the DI Combinational logic in the middle of \nthe pipeline has not yet completed processing the DATA, \nand the input of the right register is still NULL. Once the \nright register’s Ki input transitions to rfd, it latches DATA \nsignals as they arrive. As soon as all DATA signals have \nbeen latched the right register asserts a rfn signal on its Ko \noutput. One or several rfn signals are processed by the ncompletion detection logic, and the left register’s Ki input \ntransitions from rfd to rfn. As this cycle has been happening, \nthe stage to the left of the left register has been propagating \na NULL signal. Once the Ki input of the left register has \nbecome a rfn, it latches NULL inputs as they arrive, and its \noutput becomes NULL as soon as all inputs are NULL. The \nsecond half of the cycle is the mirror of the first with NULL ninstead of DATA signals and rfn instead of rfd signals. The \nphase relationship of the DATA/NULL and rfn/rfd signals \ngives the self-oscillatory behavior of a ring oscillator, while \nthe registers waiting for DATA/rfd or NULL/rfn alignment \nprovide the synchronization between adjacent ring \noscillators. \nDI registers and logic are built from a combination of \nBoolean and threshold gates. A threshold gate, shown in \nFigure 4, is a hysteretic logic gate with two or more inputs. \nThe output of a threshold gate transitions high when at least na specified number of those inputs are high. The output of \nthe threshold gate does not transition low until all inputs are \nlow.  The complete set of threshold gates is a superset of \nBoolean OR gates, Muller C-elements \(hysteretic AND \ngates gates can be found in [8], [9], \nand[10]. \nNCL advantages for Wide Temperature and Rad-Hard \nCircuits  \nNCL has long been suggested for use in extreme \nenvironments [11]. However, the benefits across wide \ntemperature and under radiation were not demonstrated until \nmore recently  [10] [12]. \nThe synchronized ring oscillator behavior described above \nhas clear benefits across wide temperatures. Each pipeline \nstage will run as fast as it can and then wait for any slower \nstages to catch up. Unlike synchronous logic, it is not \nnecessary to select a clock frequency based on worst-case \ntiming assumptions. This behavior is even more valuable in \ndata transmission systems, where a transmitter and receiver \nmay exist in radically different environments, causing one \ncircuit to run very slowly, and the other to run very quickly. \n \nm\ninput 1\ninput 2\ninput n\noutput\n nFigure 4 – n-input threshold gate which triggers on m \ninputs being asserted [9] \n  \nDI Register\nKiKo\nDI\nCombinational\nLogic\nDI Register\nKiKo\nCompletio\nDetection\nDI\nCombinational\nLogic\nDI Register\nKiKo\nCompletio\nDetection\nDI Register\nKiKo\n \nFigure 3 – NCL pipeline stages including completion detection circuitry in the feedback path. Wide arrows \nrepresent 1 or more bits, while narrow arrows represent single bits [9]. \n  4 \nThe two primary mechanisms that cause logic to change \nspeed with temperature are changing VTH \(generally \ndecreasing with temperature generally \nincreasing with temperature Since TID also shifts VTH, the \nsame aspects of NCL which make it temperature-robust, \nalso reduce its sensitivity to TID. \nKuang, et al. were the first to directly address radiation-\ninduced SETs within threshold gates [10]. They \ncategorized SETs into four categories: positive glitch \(0-1-\n0 1-0-1 positive fault transition \(0-1 1-0 


transformed into fault transitions in some circumstances, \nbut glitches that are not transformed will not propagate \nforward through the DI combinational logic to arrive at the \nDI register. Further, the authors also showed that only 0-1 \nfault transitions, combined with a Ki input of rfd will be \nlatched at the register. The authors then proposed a modified \nthreshold gate using a simplified Schmitt trigger in place of \nthe output inverter. The goal of this modification was to \nreduce the likelihood of 0-1 fault being generated by a SET nin a 300 nm channel-length non-SOI device. Experimental \nresults described here will show that the XI10 process, \nbeing rad-hard-by-process, does not require the modified \nthreshold gate topology to achieve good results. \n4. ASYNCHRONOUS DATA-TRANSMISSION \nSYSTEM DESIGN \nSystem Specification \nThe Data Transmission System, shown in Figure 5, consists \nof a Master block and a Slave block connected via a \nbidirectional serial channel. A controller \(DSP or \nMicrocontroller the Slave, to the data source \(DAQ and passes it to the master via serial channel. \nThe Master presents the complete byte to the controller. The ncontroller recognizes data complete on its input, latches it, \nand de-asserts its request for data. The Master and Slave \nclear themselves and wait for the next request for data. \nThe Master/Slave system can be a segment of a larger NCL \nsystem, but it does not have to be. The DATA and control \nsignals are NCL, but the controller and data source can treat \nthem as unclocked GPIO signals. In this paradigm, the DAQ \nreceives an activation signal, after which it provides 8 bits \nof data in a two-wire, one-hot format. Similarly, the DSP nasserts a request signal, and eventually receives an 8-bit \nsignal in a two-wire, one-hot format. The DSP is capable of \nchecking to see if the data is complete, latching it, and de-\nasserting the request signal. \nIn addition to the logic design, an electrical specification for \nthe serial transmission is also necessary Since NCL logic \nuses a two-wire signal, a differential signaling technique is \nthe logical choice, with the added benefit of noise immunity \nand ground dereferencing.  For the SiGe project both a CAN \nbus interface ISO 11898  ndominant 0 default state, so there is no ambiguous bus state. \nThis is usually a benefit, but for representing the three \nvalues in NCL, it becomes a problem.  \n \n \nFigure 5 – Master/Slave System Diagram and Flowchart \n  5 \nThe RS-485 bus standard has three bus states, 0, 1 and \nIDLE. Mapping the IDLE state to the NCL NULL state \ngives complete coverage of valid NCL logic values. \nUtilizing RS-485 compliant, full-duplex transceivers in a \ntandem unidirectional point-to-point arrangement allows the \nNCL bit stream to be transmitted over very long distances \nwith good signal integrity. Although the Ki handshaking \nsignal of an NCL system is a single-rail signal, the use of a \nfull-duplex transceiver makes it equally easy to encode the nsignal on a differential bus. Detecting the bus IDLE state at \nthe receiver requires additional circuitry which will be \ndiscussed later.  \nSlave Component Design \nThe NCL Slave component, shown in Figure 6, is nresponsible for querying the data source, latching the 8 bits \nof data, and transmitting it across the serial bus. The block \nwhich controls the rest of the Slave’s circuitry is the Delay-\nInsensitive Sequencer. A DI Sequencer serves a similar \nfunction to a counter in a Boolean logic circuit. As the Ki \ninput is cycled, the outputs step through a pattern depending \nupon the specific design. The general design of a DI \nSequencer is discussed in [14]. In this system, the \nsequencer’s Ki input is the completion signal coming over \nthe serial link from the Master. This completion signal \nalternately requests and acknowledges each individual bit \nfrom the Slave. \nFor this sequencer, at reset, the outputs S[0:7] and Ko are \nlow. When the first logic 1 request-for-DATA or rfd  When Ki is toggled to 0 \(rfn   ncontinues through S[7] going high. When the 8\nth\n rfn signal \narrives, both S[7] and the sequencer Ko go low n \n \nFigure 6 – NCL Slave Topology. Clockwise, from top \nleft: 8-bit NCL \(DI nDATA[0] output, 8-bit Boolean MUX for DATA[1] \noutput, 8-output NCL \(DI Delay-Insensitive Register with Reset to \nforce output to NULL [9] \nThe 8-Bit DI register, which latches the Slave input data, is \ncomposed of 8 of the 1-bit registers shown in Figure 7. The \nindividual 1-bit Ko outputs are combined with TH44 and \nTH22 gates to form the 8-bit Ko output.  Its Ki input, which \nfeeds the 1-bit registers in parallel, is held as a rfd signal \nuntil the sequencer completes an entire cycle. In this way nthe input data is latched until the sequencer deasserts the \nregister’s Ki input after the 8\nth\n bit has been sent to and \nacknowledged by the Master.  \nThe two Boolean MUXes use the S[0:7] outputs from the \nsequencer to select which bit to put on the serial bus at any \ngiven time. Instead of the MUX block using a 3-bit Boolean nSelect input, it has an 8-input 1-hot Select signal connected \nto the S[0:7] signal from the sequencer. When S[0:7] is all \nlogic zeros \(this is the case whenever the sequencer Ki is a \nrfn This behavior generates the \nNULL that must be transmitted over the serial link between \nbits. \nThe final 


component is the TH22n gate which combines the \nregister and sequencer Ko signals to the overall Slave Ko noutput. This signal is what activates the DAQ or other data \nsource and requests 8 bits of data. Either the register or \nsequencer Ko signal alone would be sufficient from a logical \nperspective, but by utilizing a TH22 gate, a transient glitch \nin either signal will be trapped, and avoid starting or \nshutting down the DAQ accidentally.  \nIt is worth noting that this topology will begin transmitting \nthe data over the serial bus as soon as bit 0 has been asserted \non the input. If the data source is slow, and will not assert \nall bits simultaneously, a speed improvement may be \nachieved by connecting the MSB to the bit 0 input. This \nallows data transmission to start before the DAQ has settled \non its final value.   \nMaster Component Design \nThe NCL Master, like the slave, contains an 8-bit DI \nRegister and a DI Sequencer. The schematic of the NCL \nMaster is shown in Figure 8. As data arrives over the serial \n  6 \nbus, it is recognized as valid and routed to the correct \nregister bit by the Delay Insensitive DEMUX.  \nThe DI DEMUX is similar in structure to the DI Register, \nbut each bit has a select input and a discrete completion bit \n\(Figure 9 driven by the DI Sequencer \noutputs just as the Slave’s MUX Select inputs are driven by \nits sequencer. The TH22n gates common in a DI register are \nreplaced with a TH33n where the third input is connected to \nthe completion signal. This feedback mechanism locks each \nregister to a valid NCL data \(10 or 01 the \nregister from going to a 11 state in case of a transient on the \ninput.  The 8 individual completion signals are sent to the \nBit-Arrival Recognition Logic, where they are ANDed \ntogether, giving a single data arrival strobe, which drives the \nKi input of the Master’s DI Sequencer. \nThe DI DEMUX data strobe toggles the DI Sequencer Ki so \nthat each time the DEMUX receives a new bit the sequencer \noutput is changed. Again, the sequencer is acting as a \ncounter; once a bit is received the next incoming bit will be \nrouted to the next register location. The data strobe is also \nANDed with the Master Ki and the sequencer Ko. This \nsignal is the serial-stream completion bit that is sent to the \nSlave to confirm arrival of the current DATA or NULL nsignal.    \nFinally, the 8-bit DI Register receives the output of the DI \nDEMUX. The function is exactly the same as in the Slave, \nbut the strong latching capability of the register is more \nobvious. A single bit’s worth of data is presented to the \nregister at a time, and that bit is latched. The serial stream \nwill revert to a NULL which is passed through the DI \nDEMUX to all inputs of the DI Register before the next bit \narrives and is directed to the next register location. Not only \nwill the register latch any data as it arrives, but every data \nbit arrives, is latched, and is replaced by a NULL before the \nnext bit arrives. \n \n  \nFigure 8 NCL Master Topology.

The bias networks are complementary, so that if the nfirst comparator is detecting A>B, but the second \ncomparator is registering B>A, then the bus is determined to \nbe IDLE.

The comparator is a direct implementation of an \nexisting high-speed comparator design in the XI10 process \n[16].     \nThe Differential Line Driver portion of the transceiver does \nnot require any special features beyond a standard RS-485 \ndriver. It is designed to achieve >200 mV differential on a \n22-24 AWG twisted pair over 1000 m in length with a \nstandard 120 ? terminating resistance at the far end. Since ntransmission in the NCL system is unidirectional, a single \ntermination resistance at the receiver is sufficient to avoid \nDI\nDE\nY\nAVDD\nAVSS\n \nFigure 12 – Half of the Differential Line Driver \nreflections increasing the effective drive strength. The \ndriver is also capable of driving an additional termination 


nresistance at the near end for half-duplex uses. One half of \nthe driver is shown in Figure 12. The other half is identical \nwith the addition of an inverter on the DI input. \nTo set the bus to the IDLE state, the driver goes into a high-\nimpedance state, allowing the cable voltage to drain across \nthe terminating resistance. Future improvements to the \nTransceiver could include a specialized comparator design \nwithout the input bias resistors, and a driver capable of \nactively driving the bus to the IDLE state. \n5. SYSTEM SIMULATION \nMaster/Slave Functional Verification \nBefore schematics were finalized, the Master and Slave ncomponents were modeled at the individual gate level in \nbehavioral VHDL. Once the behavioral model was nvalidated, the designs were entered into a schematic-capture \ntool, and simulated with SPICE. Figure 13 and Figure 13 \nshow the progression from behavioral to device-level \nsimulation.  \nMaster/Slave Performance across Temperature \nThe Master and Slave components were tested across \ntemperature without the RS-485 link between them to \n \nFigure 13 – VHDL simulation of Master/Slave system \n  8 \ndetermine the effectiveness of the delay-insensitive design.  \n shows the final bit \(bit 7 is received over the serial link.  The speed \nof the circuit is highest at    -175° C, and decreases nmonotonically with temperature. In this simulation the data \ninputs are asserted before the Slave requests them, and the \nKi input of the Master is asserted at 200 ns.  The effective \nbit rate was calculated by finding the time at which the \nSlave’s Ko output goes low, subtracting the 200 ns time of \nthe initial request, and dividing this by 8 bits. This is the \nmost accurate measure of the theoretical upper bound of the ncircuit speed without considering the speed of the DSP/?C \nand DAQ, or wire delays. Figure 15 shows the estimated \nbit-rate calculated in this way. \n \nEffects of RS-485 Interface on Performance \nIntroducing the RS-485 link into the system added two \ntransceivers, two twisted pairs, and a small amount of \ninterface logic on each side to translate between Boolean \nand NCL signals. For each of the two twisted pairs, a \ncoupled multi-conductor line was used, with parameters \nextracted from measurements of 1000 feet of cat5e cable nshows the bus signals and output logic signals for both \nDATA and Serial K at 25°C. \n \nFigure 15 Theoretical maximum bit rate for the \nMaster/Slave circuit across temperature \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n-200 -100 0 100 200 300\nM\nb\np\ns \nTemperature \(° C nincreasing temperature \n \nFigure 13 – SPICE-simulation of Master/Slave system at 25° C without the RS-485 Transceiver \n \n-175° C \n225° C \n  9 \nSimulations were performed with cable lengths of 1m, 10m, \nand 100m for both the DATA and Serial K paths.

SUMMARY  \nHigh-Temperature SOI has great potential to complement \nother processes in extreme environments. It has been shown \nthat with extensions to the device models, circuits can be \ndesigned to function from -175° C to 225° C, a range of nover 400° C! HTSOI is also less susceptible to TID and SET \nradiation effects than many other processes without \nrequiring specific measures be taken by the IC designer. \nSimulations indicate that circuits without positive feedback \nare tolerant to LETs of over 100 MeV*cm\n2\n/mg, and circuits \nwith positive feedback are still tolerant above 40 \nMeV*cm\n2\n/mg.  \nImplementing a Data-Transmission system that uses Quasi-\nDelay Insensitive logic in HTSOI allows for maximum \nperformance across all temperatures, providing effective \ndata 


rates of over 35 Mb/s at -175° C. Coupling this logic \ndesign with a differential bus such as RS-485 allows this \ntechnology to extend across long distances as well as \nenvironmental conditions. \nFurther work includes completing low-temperature model \nvalidation, as well as fabrication of the designed logic and \ntransceiver circuits. Although the threshold gates as \ndesigned showed considerable radiation hardness, \ninvestigation of other threshold gate topologies may provide \nfurther improvements.    \n \nREFERENCES  \n[1]  R.

Existing clinical functional elec-\ntrical stimulation systems use the patient’s residual movement to activate muscles and \nrestore simple grasp. We have developed a BMI to control muscle activation, allowing \n monkey subjects to pick up and move objects despite complete paralysis of the flexor muscles below the el-\nbow. Such a system could restore voluntary movements to SCI patients through normal cognitive processes.  \nHowever, a critical remaining issue is the need to restore proprioception, the loss of which largely eliminates \nthe ability to plan movement dynamics. Neurons in the somatosensory cortex signal limb movement with dis-\ncharge that is broadly tuned to a “preferred direction 


By stimulating small groups of electrodes with similar \npreferred directions, we can induce perceptions of limb motion similar to those caused by actual limb move-\nment. We are developing a neuroprosthesis that would restore a sense of limb state to SCI patients. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Lee E.

He is currently the Edgar C. \nStuntz Distinguished Professor of Neuroscience in the Departments of Physiology, Physical Medicine and \nRehabilitation, and Biomedical Engineering at Northwestern University. His primary research interests are \nin the cortical control of muscle activity and limb movement the representation of limb state by the soma-\ntosensory system, and in the development of brain–machine interfaces that attempt to mimic normal \nphysiological systems. \n \n \nP. Hunter Peckham \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE Neuroprostheses for Movement Restoration \n \nAbstract: Major advances have been made over the past decade in use of neuropros-\ntheses for restoration of motor function.  These advances have been built on the fun-\ndamental science of neural excitation and the technologies for implantable stimulation \nand control. The technologies have advanced to provide operational systems that func-\ntion in the human body for decades, and include implantable electrodes, stimulation \ndevices, and sensors.  The neural interface between the excitable tissue and the delivery electrode are ena-\nbling evermore powerful control and precision in the delivery of stimulation, not only providing for excita-\ntion but also blocking of neural activity \(e.g. for annihilation of pain or spasticity interfaces are currently in development \nthat will provide greater flexibility in implementation and performance. \n \nThe clinical manifestations of these findings are the available systems that have been created, and are being \ndeveloped, to restore function.  These include many areas of the body for people with spinal cord injury, \nincluding hand grasp, standing and walking, breathing, and bladder and bowel control Several patients \nhave benefited from systems that enable more than one function \(e.g. hand function and bladder control restore full \narm mobility and levels of standing and ambulation.  Several areas where future advances are likely to meet \nclinical challenges will be discussed.   \n \nBiographical Sketch: P. Hunter Peckham is currently at the Institute for Functional Restoration, or IFR, at \nCase Western Reserve University \(CWRU deploys neuroprosthetic interventions into clinical use to re-\nstore the functions lost due to spinal cord injury or other paralytic conditions.  The IFR acts as the surro-\ngate corporate partner for the neural technologies that have demonstrated feasibility within the research \nprograms. Dr. Peckham is also the Principal Investigator on the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging \nand Bioengineering \(NIBIB Research Partnership award which has led to the development of \nthe Networked Neuroprosthesis. \n \n The major area of Dr. Peckham’s research is in rehabilitation engineering and neuroprostheses. Dr. Peck-\nham’s research effort focuses on functional restoration of the paralyzed upper extremity in individuals with \nspinal cord injury. He and collaborators developed a number of implantable neural prostheses which utilize \nelectrical stimulation to control neuromuscular activation. They have implemented procedures to provide \ncontrol upper extremity in individuals with tetraplegia, enabling individuals with central nervous system \ndisability to regain the ability to perform essential activities of daily living. His present efforts concern \ntechnology development, expansion of the indications for this technology, and technology transfer. \n \nDr. Peckham is a fellow of the American Institute of Medical and Biological Engineering; a fellow and hon-\norary member of the American Spinal Injury Association; member of the National Academy of Engineering.  \nHe is a member of numerous professional organizations.

Some are acted upon immedi-\nately, but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions -- our implicit "label-\ning" of the world. In this talk I will describe our work using physiological correlates of this labeling to con-\nstruct a hybrid brain-computer interface \(hBCI record electroencephalographic \(EEG part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate \nthe neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective inter-\nest. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using nsemi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to those that are labelled. \nFinally, the system plots an efficient route so that subjects visit similar objects of interest. We show that by \nexploiting the subjects' implicit labeling, the median search precision is increased from 25% to 97%, and the \nmedian subject need only travel 40% of the distance to see 84% of the objects of interest. We also find that \nthe neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers inference of subjects' \nimplicit labeling. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of ob-\njects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting \nin an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user's interests. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Paul Sajda is Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Radiol-\nogy at Columbia University and Director of the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing \n\(LIINC modeling and \nmachine learning applied to image understanding.

White \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Are Our Cellular Models Fundamentally Wrong? \n \nAbstract: The Hodgkin-Huxley model, arguably the greatest success story in the history \nof computational neuroscience, is the predecessor of thousands of existing cellular models \nthat span a significant range of levels of detail. Here, using electrophysiological, dynamic-\nclamp, and computational techniques, we demonstrate that many of the “gold standard” \nsingle-cell models, used by thousands of laboratories, fail to account correctly for the responses of well-studied \nexcitatory neurons to noise.  In particular, the input-output gain of entorhinal stellate cells and neocortical py-\nramidal cells is substantially less sensitive to noise than predicted by the models.  The major source of the dis-\ncrepancy is that the models fit measured peri-threshold voltage dynamics poorly.  Because noise is ubiquitous \nand prominent in the brain, and because neuronal gain is crucial for understanding a wide range of response nproperties at the cellular and network levels, we argue that this is an issue of fundamental importance. \n nBiographical Sketch:  John A.

Despite spending as little as 0.01% of their lives having seizures, people \nwith epilepsy take antiepileptic drugs \(AEDs ex-\nperience significant AED related side effects, and approximately 1/3 continue to have seizures. Mapping the \nbrain networks generating seizures is critical for successful epilepsy surgery, therapeutic brain stimulation, \nand seizure forecasting. In focal epilepsy the spontaneous, evoked, and induced brain activity is disrupted \nover a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. Multiscale electrophysiology recordings have uncovered a range \nof electrophysiological biomarkers, measurable interictal \(between seizures normal and \npathological tissue that show promise for spatiotemporal mapping of epileptogenic brain.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
