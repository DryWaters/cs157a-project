Generalized Time Related Sequential Association Rule Mining and Traf田 Prediction Huiyu Zhou Shingo Mabu MemberIEEE Kaoru Shimada MemberIEEE and Kotaro Hirasawa MemberIEEE Abstract  Time Related Association rule mining is a kind of sequence pattern mining for sequential databases In this paper we introduce a method of Generalized Association Rule Mining using Genetic Network Programming GNP with time series processing mechanism in order to nd time related sequential rules ef田iently GNP represents solutions as directed graph structures thus has compact structure and implicit memory function The inherent features of GNP make it possible for GNP to work well especially in dynamic environments GNP has been applied to generate time related candidate association rules as a tool using the database consisting of a large number of time related attributes The aim of this algorithm is to better handle association rule extraction from the databases in a variety of time-related applications especially in the traf田 volume prediction problems The generalized algorithm which can nd the important time related association rules is described and experimental results are presented considering a traf田 prediction problem I I NTRODUCTION Data mining the process of extracting hidden and/or predictive information from large databases has become an important eld since a large amount of data have been collected in various applications Mining these data ef田iently and effectively is too dif田ult and intricate when using conventional methods especially for the sequential database in dynamic systems Sequence pattern mining is the analytical process of digging through and exploring the enormous sets of sequential data for the search of association patterns and systematic relationships between attributes in sequential datasets For example If Section S on the traf田 map has high traf田 volume then the Section D also has high traf田 volume is a typical relationship that we will obtain using the normal data mining methods however in dynamic systems with sequential datasets we are more interested in the sequential association patterns such as If Section S on the traf田 map has high traf田 volume at time t  then Section D also has high traf田 volume 10 time units later In order to extract these sequential association patterns in the time-related databases and represent at what time the event will happen or how long the event will persist we have already proposed a method of time-related association rule mining using Genetic Netw ork Programming GNP to improve the ef田iency and effectiveness of the rule extraction in time related databases But in this paper we generalized the original time-related association rule mining in terms Graduate School of Information Production and Systems Waseda University Email zhy836@toki.waseda.jp mabu@aoni.waseda.jp k.shimada@aoni.waseda.jp hirasawa@waseda.jp of multi-judgements where there are a good number of branches in the judgement nodes instead of simple Yes/Noside branches in the conventional method The most popular model in the association rule mining is Apriori algorithm in which Agrawal et al proposed the support-con電ence framework Ho we v e r  Apriori algorithm may suffer from large computational complexity for rule extraction when extracting from dense databases Many approaches have been proposed to extract association information in various directions including ef田ient apriori-like mining methods 4 The v ariations of Apriori approach such as the hash-based algorithm have also been studied for ef田iency 6 Genetic Algorithm\(GA  proposed by J.H Holland has also been applied to data mining research in order to deal with dense databases Holland proposed two kinds of approaches Pittsburgh approach and Michigan approach However because a rule is represented as an individual or part of an individual of GA it is hard for them to give us a complete picture of the underlying relationships in problem domains thus not easy to extract enough number of association rules Genetic Programming\(GP 10 impro v e d the e xpression ability of GA by evolving individuals as tree structures Although GP enables a more explicit representation of association rules it may suffer from the problems of loose structure and bloating especially in dynamic problems Unlike the other methods mentioned above the main task of GNP-based data mining is to allow the GNP individuals to self-evolve and extract association rules as many as possible What尽 more it uses evolved individuals\(directed graphs of GNP just as a tool to extract candidate association rules Thus the structure of GNP individuals does not necessarily represent the association relations of the database Instead the extracted association rules are stored together in the rule pool separated from the individuals As a result the structures of GNP individuals are less restricted than the structures of GA and GP and GNP-based data mining becomes capable of producing a large number of association rules The basic feature of the proposed mechanism is like the following  The GNP structure of rule representation is generalized to multiple branches instead of simply Yes-side or No-side transitions Thus it could be applied to generate candidate association rules in a more generalized and ef田ient way  The database is time-related

factor Thus the same attribute has different meanings at different time points  The process of searching the data for calculating the con電ence support and chi-squared value becomes two dimensional search  We aims at extracting rules to predict the traf田 volume of all the the sections on the road networks So Extraction Mechanism at Stages\(EMS is applied where all the sections are considered as the consequent part step by step  Better attributes are also accumulated gradually round by round in the evolution process using Attribute Accumulation Algorithm\(AAA  A simple classi田ation mechanism is combined with the rule extraction system thus the time related rules can be used to predict the future traf田 volume on the traf田 networks  Another feature of our method is that we can predict not only the traf田 jam of a speci田 section on the road networks but also can predict the low middle and high traf田 volume of all of the sections on the road network which might be useful in future applications II G ENETIC N ETWORK P ROGRAMMING GNP The basic idea of Genetic Network Programming\(GNP is brie輩 introduced in this section GNP is an extension of Genetic Algorithm\(GA 8 which represents directed graph structures as solutions 12 13 GNP can reuse nodes thus has compact structures and implicit memory function which can deal with not only the current information but also the past information implicitly Also GNP can nd solutions of the problems without bloating compared with Genetic Programming\(GP 10 because of the xed number of nodes in GNP The basic expression of GNP node is shown in Fig.1 This describes the gene of node i  then the set of these genes represents the genotype of GNP individuals NT i describe the node type NT i  0 means node i is the start node NT i  1 represents node i is a judgment node and NT i  2 represents node i is a processing node ID i is an identi田ation number for example NT i  1 and ID i 1 means node i is J 1 Judgment node with ID 1  C i 1  C i 2  denote the nodes connected from node i  d i and d ij are the delay times required to execute the processing of node i and transition from node i to node C ij  The basic structure of GNP is also shown in Fig.1 The graph structure of GNP includes three kinds of nodes start node judgment nodes and processing nodes Judgment nodes are the set of J 1  J 2  which work as if-then type logical decision making functions On the other hand processing nodes are the set of P 1  P 2  which work as a certain kind of action/processsing function The concrete roles of these nodes are prede渡ed and stored in the library Once GNP is started up rstly the execution starts from the start node consequently the next node to execute is determined  StartNode ProcessingNode  Judgment Node NTi IDi di Ci1 di1 Cij dij  node gene connection gene node i 0 0 0 1,0 Node 0 1 1 0 2,0 Node 1 2 2 0 3,0 4,0 Node 2 2,3,0 4,0 1,0 Node 3 1,4,0 1,0 Node 4 Start:0 1 3 2 4 P 1 J 2 J 3 P 4 Directed Gra ph Fig 1 Basic structure of GNP according to the connection and if-then judgment results of the current node III G ENERALIZED T IME R ELATED A SSOCIATION R ULE M INING USING GNP A Outline of the Proposed Method The whole procedure of the proposed algorithm is like Fig.2 The rst step is the time related class association rule extraction step based on given class type and attribute set to extract the rules about time related database In rule extraction procedure two kinds of iterations are included i.e the outer iteration represents the class association rule mining which means to extract the class rules of all the consequent attributes with Attribute Accumulation Algorithm while the inner iteration represents the basic procedure of the time related data mining which uses GNP individuals to generate the candidate rules then calculate the support con電ence and chi-squared values of the candidate rules based on the time related databases Class type Time Relat ed Class Association Rule Extraction Attribute set Time related database Classification Testing database Prediction Result Actual Situation Compare Accur acy Fig 2 Basic steps of proposed algorithm 2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation CEC 2009 2655

between data and antecedent part of the rules in each class and the class with the highest degree of matching will be selected The selected class is the classi田ation result If the classi田ation result is the same with the actual situation then the prediction is correct otherwise incorrect and we can obtain the accuracy of the prediction in this way B Structure of Database When processing the real-time information systems the databases are to be designed and developed to satisfy the time related requirements These kind of requirements allow us to predict the occurrence of the critical events in the time domain Traf田 prediction is one of these problems The traf田 ow in each section of the road networks is changing constantly as time goes on In order to better predict the traf田 ow of the road networks in the future the database should represent at what time the events in the road section happened or how long the events lasted Here the time unit represent the conceptional time unit i.e it could be one second one minute or the time for one episode therefore the time unit could be exible enough according to the concrete problem to solve According to the range of the continuous values of the attributes we divide the continuous values into three categories i.e Low Middle and High Supposing that the Middle threshold is 4 and High threshold is 7 the attribute A 9 is ranked as A  High  i.e  A  Low  A  M iddle  A  High  0  0  1 as shown in Table 2 C Generalized GNP Mining The proposed generalized method extracts important time related association rules using GNP supposing the connections of nodes are represented as association rules The generalized time-related association rule mining means that there a good number of branches in the judgement nodes in stead of simply Yes-side or No-side transition in the previous method The basic structure of the generalized GNP network structure for class association rule mining is shown in Fig.3 The jump mechanism is also used in order to determine the antecedent part but we don腎 have to decide the consequent part of candidates rules because we are considering classi田ation problems Therefore we are now focusing on extracting rules with xed consequent corresponding to each class of the attributes In order to do that all the items of the consequent part are placed in Consequent Table CT  shown in Fig.3 This means that GNP individuals are evolved to extract the class association rules for each class of the attributes i.e for each traf田 volume level of each section of the road networks and this procedure is repeated for all the consequent items GNP individual exclusively extracts the association rules about one consequent item in CT  which is called the current consequent item as shown in Fig.3 In addition a suf田ient xed number Nf  of rules for each item in CT are obtained in the proposed method From Fig.3 we can see that each judgement node of GNP is in charge of examining the corresponding attribute for example A 1  e.g Low Middle and High of attribute A 1 If A 1 satis兎s the High condition then moves to the Highside of the transition and  a  b and c  are counts of the moves to the corresponding judgement result\(High/Middle/Low of attribute A 1  Although the transition of the nodes changes according to the judgement result of High/Middle/Low the transition from the same judgement node shares the same time delay as shown in Fig.3 The time delays are used for the two dimensional search related to the time which will be explained later in more details The total number of moving to each branch from the processing node at each judgment node is calculated for every processing node which is a starting point for calculating association rules as described above In Fig.4 N is the total number of the search and a  b and c are the numbers of search moving to A 1  Mid   A 2  Low  and A 3  Mid  at each judgment node A 1  A 2 and A 3  The measurements are calculated by these numbers For example as represented in Fig.4 if processing node P 1 jumps from A 1 to A 3  then the antecedent part of the candidate rules becomes   A 1  Mid   t 0   A 2  Low   t 2   A 3  Mid   t 4  and the current item in the Consequent Table CT  is for example   A c  Mid   t 6  considering the time delay T 2  which can also be evolved Then we can also pick up the candidate rules like   A 1  Mid   t 0   A c  Mid   t 2    A 1  Mid   t 0   A 2  Low   t 2   A c  Mid   t 4  and   A 1  Mid   t 0   A 2  Low   t 2   A 3  Mid   t 4   A c  Mid   t 6  in the same jumping operation which we call Multi-Rules Mechanism MRM  During one Jumping of the processing node several candidate rules will be generated and the times of moving to the Low/Middle/High connection are counted This count provides the basic data for the evaluation of the candidates rules As a result chi  squared value can be 2656 2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation CEC 2009 


calculated considering both the antecedent and consequent part of the candidate rules We can repeat this like a chain operation in each generation by jumping the processing nodes in the class association rule mining with time series using GNP Now we de渡e the important association rules as the ones which satisfy the minimum chi-squared support and con電ence value i.e  2 min  sup min and conf min  respectively In this de渡ition if the rule  X  Y  is important then X  Y  X  Y  X  Y Y  X Y  X  Y  X and  Y  X  are also important rules The extracted important association rules are stored in a pool all together through generations in order to nd new important rules  A 2,Mid  High connection Middle connection  Jumping T Time Dela y ProsessingNode  Judgment Node  moved position  Low connection Consequent Ta ble A 1,Low A 1,Mid A 1,High A 2,Low A 2,High   A N,High Current Consequent N P 1 N Jumping A 1 A 2 A 3 a b c d T 0 T u T v P 1 T 0 A 6 A 5 A 4 T u T u e f T v T v j k l Fig 3 Basic structure of class association rule mining using GNP Ti me Unit A 1 A 2 A 3 A c Low Mi ddl l e Hi gh Low Mi ddl e Hi gh Low Mi ddl e Hi gh Low Mi ddl e Hi gh 0000 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0001 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0002 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0003 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0004 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0005 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0006 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0007 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0008 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0009 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0010 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 N P 1 T 0 P 1 Jumping Low Middle High c A 1 Current Consequent Ac Middle A 2 a b T 2 T 2 T 2 A 3 Fig 4 Two dimensional searching method D Extraction Mechanism at Stages\(EMS and Attribute Accumulation Mechanism\(AAM We use Extraction Mechanism at Stages EMS  here because our method basically aims at extracting rules of all of the attributes in the database i.e all classes of all the sections on the road networks Unlike other conventional methods one of the unique points of our methods is to get class association rules for all of the attributes Thus we need to get enough number Nf  of class association rules for each class of all attributes in order to acquire the high accuracy of the classi田ation If the number of the extracted rules reach a certain xed number Nf for the current class of the consequent attribute then the stage for the current class of the consequent attribute ends and another stage for the next item in the CT will begin likewise The number of the rules Nf for each class of the attributes should be suf田iently large enough But it might be possible that there do not exist enough number of rules for some classes of the attributes when using the current importance levels especially in some rare cases when the instances do not occur frequently enough for the extraction of class association rules Thus in this paper we introduce the self-adaptive criteria for the importance levels and they are adjusted gradually depending on the number of new class association rules extracted in recent generations If the number of new rules generated in recent generations equal to 0  which means no more important rules can be found for the current item in Consequent Table CT  the criteria for the importance levels are changed until a certain xed number Nf of rules are obtained using the following equations  2 min   2 min  s 1  1 sup min  sup min  s 2  2 conf min  conf min  s 3  3 where s 1  s 2 and s 3 in 0  1  represent the step size decrease for the minimum chi-squared support and con電ence value respectively  2 min  sup min and conf min are initialized for every item of the Consequent Table CT  Attribute Accumulation Mechanism AAM  is also combined with Extraction Mechanism at Stages EMS o accumulate better attributes round by round in our algorithm thus we can nd better and tter attributes in GNP in an exploitative way The proposed GNP-based mining method for extracting class association rules for each item in Consequent Table CT  is shown in Fig.5 where GNP based data mining consists of a sequence of generations E Structure of Rules Let A i     t  p  be an attribute in a database at time p and its value is 1 or 0 A i    represents A i  Low   A i  M iddle   A i  High   The general association rule mining with time series extracts the following association rules  A j     t  p    A k     t  q    A m     t  r    A n     t  s  Here p  q  r  s  and the rst t always equals 0 and 2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation CEC 2009 2657

all of the traf田 volume\(High/Middle/Low are predicted for all of the sections on road networks A Traf田 Simulator Each section between two intersections in the road networks has two directions and we assume each direction of the section represents different literals i.e items or attributes The traf田 simulator used in our simulations consists of the road model with 7  7 roads like Fig.6 i.e each section has the same length all cars have the same speed for simplicity and the shape of the total road is like a grid network Time shift in road setting in Fig.6 represents the time delay of the traf田 lights between neighboring intersections Actually the cars on the road networks do not have the same speed Every time unit all the cars can move forward by length 1 if and only if there exist spaces before them thus the actual speed of all cars are in盃enced by the traf田 lights or traf田 jams For example if a car encounters the red light or traf田 jam it has to wait until the red light period passes or all the hindrances before it are removed Therefore the cars have different speeds depending on the concrete traf田 situations   N1 N2 N3 N4 N5 N6 N7 S1 S2 S3 S4 S5 S6 S7 W2 W1 W3 W4 W5 W6 W7 E2 E1 E3 E4 E5 E6 E7 represent car   represent O/D name representsectionfromintersectionW2N4toW2N5 representsectionfrom intersectionW2N5toW2N4  represent intersection W3N3 Road Setting Maximum number of cars 10 cars per section Car arrival distribution exponential distribution Red traffic light 10 time units Green traffic light 7timeunits Yello w traffic light 3timeunits Time shift 10 time units Fig 6 Road model used in simulations TABLE III P ARAMETER SETTING FOR EVOLUTION Items Values Number of judgment nodes 100 Number of processing nodes 10 Number of attributes 224 Number of attributes including classes 672 Number of time units 800 Number of generations per round 100 Minimum support value 0.1 Minimum con電ence value 0.8 Minimum chi-squared value 6.63 The parameter setting of the proposed data mining is presented in Table 3 The attributes correspond to the judgment node functions for example the class of the attribute  W 4 N 6 W 4 N 7 Low   can be interpreted in such a way that the section named W 4 N 6 W 4 N 7  has low traf田 volume We have 7  8  2 112 sections in our simulator and each section has two directions so there exist 112  2  224 sections in total What尽 more each section has 3 categories High/Mid/Low thus we have 224  3  672 attributes including classes Time units in Table 3 represents the number of total time units in our database B Simulation 1 In simulation 1 the number of rules stored in the rule pool is compared between the proposed method with Generalized GNP and conventional method with Normal GNP Each round has the same number of generations of 50 and the chosen set size for AAM is 0 20000 40000 60000 80000 100000 120000 140000 160000 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 Rounds Total Number of Rules Extracted Generalized GNP Conventional GNP Fig 7 Total number of rules extracted 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 Round Number of Rules Extracted Generalized GNP Conventional GNP Fig 8 The number of rules extracted per each round Fig.7 shows the number of rules obtained in the rule pool versus round number In the conventional method GNP individuals have only the Yes-side connection while Generalized GNP individuals have multi-branches like Fig.3 in the proposed method We can see from Fig.7 that the proposed method can extract important class association rules ef田iently when compared with the conventional one Fig.8 shows the number of rules extracted per each round Although in some rounds we can obtain more than 500 rules the average number of rules extracted per round is not high We can see that there exist some rare cases where 2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation CEC 2009 2659

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
