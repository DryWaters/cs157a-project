Table V gives the set of intervals in which the variations are not significant. These intervals are computed based on the risk RSA 1.65;+1.65] 10 1.96;+1.96] 5 2.58;+2.58] 1 3.29;+3.29] 0.1 TABLE V INTERVALS IN WHICH NON-SIGNIFICANCE IS DETECTED When the RSA is applied to the association education ? wage results listed in table VI education wage [6;7] [8;9] [10;13] [14;18 2.85; 4.70] 1.83 1.69 3.88 -4.94 4.75; 7.14] 0.41 0.76 1.37 -1.88 7.30; 12.67] -0.72 -0.62 0.17 0.59 13.00; 26.29] -0.99 -1.49 -6.35 6.56 TABLE VI ADJUSTED STANDARDIZED RESIDUAL OF THE ASSOCIATION EDUCATION-WAGE The negative values denote underrepresentativeness, and the positive ones overrepresentativeness We can now transpose these results to initial variations contingency, table III Table VII represents the enhanced variations contingency. In order to notice the differences, all grayed cells are pruned thanks to the RSA education wage [6;7] [8;9] [10;13] [14;18 2.85; 4.70] 3 4 15 -22 4.75; 7.14] 1 3 8 -12 7.30; 12.67] -2 -3 1 5 13.00; 26.29] -1 -4 -25 30 TABLE VII ENHANCED CONTINGENCY TABLE OF VARIATIONS FOR THE ASSOCIATION \(EDUCATION-WAGE This table is the starting point of the consolidation process described below 39 


V. CONSOLIDATION PROCESS The first step to build the largest zones is to scan the enhanced contingency table of variations looking for the cell with the highest absolute value This cell constitutes the first rectangle noted R1 with the coordinates of upper left point pl and lower right point pr The second scan compares all the values in the immediate neighborhood of R1. The expansion is performed in descending fashion, i.e. starting from the largest value with similar behavior of the constituted rectangle expanded to the new coordinates The expansion of the formed rectangle continues by performing the summation of its vicinity cells values. We start by including cells whose values sum is the largest. The expansion stops once meeting null cells and the consolidation process ends when all maximal rectangles are formed. These results allow restricting the number of records to be processed by only keeping those retained after the consolidation phase When applying this process to the enhanced contingency table of variations resulting from the education-wage only would be considered the records included in the clusters "education=[10;13]" or "education=[14;18]" associated to "wage=[2.85;4.70]" or wage=[13;26.29 Notice, in the case of the association education ? wage process enables to focus on 172 records instead of 526 \(32 VI. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we describe our discretization approach focusing on the potential interactions between a databases variables. This approach makes it possible to carry out a contextual discretization maximizing the informativeness and highlighting the variables dependencies The use of a tabular representation is particularly interesting in the case of numeric variables 


where knowledge is synthetically summarized. The formed attractive and repulsive zones, based on human considerations and statistics, guarantee that potentially interesting knowledge will be discovered with decreasing by the way the search space REFERENCES 1] J.
