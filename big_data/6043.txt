The basic idea of the algorithm is identify aU the frequent itemsets to get association rule. This paper presents the improved Apriori algorithm based on interested items, which mainly construct an ordered interested table and traverse it to excavate frequent itemsets quickly. The paper also by writing c# code achieves the improved algorithm Confirmed by many experiments, this algorithm is better than traditional algorithms in time consuming Keywords- Apriori algorithm; association rules; interested itemsets; freq uent itemsets I. BACKGROUND Data Mining is a very popular topic in the business community in recent years, it uses statistical and artificial intelligence algorithm and find hidden laws from a large industry historical data and then establish an accurate model to predict the future. Besides, the mining of Association rule is an important issue of Data Mining [1 


The mainly technology of data mining is association rules clustering, rough sets, neural networks, genetic algorithms and so on. Large number of studies from different perspectives on the association rules to do the extension, take more factors into association rule mining method among the association rules as a rich application areas, broaden the scope to support management decision-making. In recent years, association rules surrounding the research has focused on two aspects, namely, the classic association rules extend the scope of the problem to solve and improve the efficiency of classical algorithms for mining association rules [21 II. RELATED WORKS A. Related Concepts Suppose I = {iJ, i2 ... , in} is a collection of items, in which element is called item. D is a collection of transaction T, Transaction T is a collection of items, and Tct. In order to avoid duplication of transactions are covered[31 .In this article I give a unique mark to each of transaction in the transaction database TID. Suppose X is a collection of I .If Xg', then we call that T contains X An association rule like X?y. Here XcI, YcI, and XnY=CP. Support of Rule X?Y in Transaction database D is the ratio between the number of transactions which contain X and 1', that is support\(X?Y X u Y 978-1-4244-5540-9/10/$26.00 2010 IEEE 422 Confidence of Rule X?Y in Transaction database D is the ratio between the number of transactions which contain X and Y and the number of transactions containing X, denoted confidence\(X?Y X?Y X]Y a transaction set D, the problem of mining association rule is to find an association rule whose support and confidence respectively greater than the minimum support \(minsup minimum confidence \(minconj B. The Example Illustrates the Traditional Apriori Algorithms Transaction database as shown in Table I, minsup =50 minconf =70%.Request the frequent association rules in transaction database D TABLE I.

Confidence level is 100 Time Complexity Analysis Scan database 3 times; Data Processing of database 15 times to get frequent l-itemset; Data Processing 19 times to get frequent 2-itemset; Data Processing of database 11 times to get frequent 3-itemset, that is 45 times data processing in all III. THE DESCRIPTION OF IMPROVED ALGORITHM A. The Ideas and Implementation Steps of the Improved Algorithm From the above process, we see that some disadvantages in the traditional data mining. Firstly, the process of scanning database is too frequently. Secondly, many operations are unnecessary duplication, waste of time and space. Thirdly we are not interested in EF, so it should not be start to operate on EF The first step: This paper presents the various items of interest in a subset of items of frequency 1 database 2 data structure 3 subset of items of interest in items of the frequency 4 interest The second step: find the association B. The Implementation Description of Improved Algorithm Suppose transaction database has showed as Table I Interested Items: ABC First: Construct data structures 1 


information as Table II TABLE II. THE INFORMATION TABLE OF TRANSACTION DATABASE Frequency Item Mark No. ID Itemsets number 1 A B C 1 3 6 2 A B  2 2 4 3 C 1 1 1 ID is the key of Table II. Frequency marks that how many times the itemsets appear in the transaction database Item number is the number of the itemsets. Mark No. derived through an algorithm which we will introduce below Firstly, construct a database information queue Sq IInfo Queue have the properties of the above form Table.2. Sec?ndly traversal transaction database, take out each record m the database to fmd interest itemsets through the algorithm which will introduce below; then ,find its Item number and mark No. according to the interested itemsets. Finally, insert the record into SqlInfoQueue index by the item number and mark No., if the record has existed, frequency increase 1 The construction of SqlInfoQueue has already completed Note: SqlInfoQueue is ordered by Item number and mark number, the priority of item number is higher than mark number 2 ID is the table primary key; Flag is bit array, the size of the array of interest in a subset of the number of items namely, a subset of items and interest-one correspondence Frequency is the number of the set which contains in the transaction database; Sign is a structure, In the column of Pass mark, it contains a lot of Sign type object; The number of itemsets and the marked number are the same as Table II The last column record the children address 423 Each itemsets have some children, each child can search by the function of SeekingChildren. And marked according to the number of itemsets and the marked number, the number of itemsets priority is higher than the marked number. Complete to construct Interested Table 3 structures Data structure of Sign is showed in Table IV TABLE IV. PASS MARK TABLE 


Count ill int int ID in Table 4 is used to mark any subset of interested items, and it corresponds to ID in Table III, that is, each itemset correspond to an ID. Count marked the number of itemsets. We construct a result array, each item of the array contains ID, each item of the array corresponds to an ID and frequency of item sets. Result array saves the final result Methods of The mark number Input the itemsets, output the mark numbe? of the itemsets. According to the interested items and theIr length each item of the interested item corresponds to an integer request: the integer plus the location of the item in the interested items equal to the length of the interested items Traverse the itemsets and change each item into an integer and then add all the integers, the result is the one we need to correspond to each item of the interested items Methods of SeekingChildren Input any itemset, output all its children. Get all its subsets according to the itemsets. Traversal the subset, the item whose item number plus 1 is equal to the item number of the itemset we input is the child of this itemset Secondly: Traverse Interest table according to the information in SqlInfoQueue Step 1: Pop-up an element Queuing from SqlInfoQueue and judge whether Queuing is empty, if Queuing is empty we execute OnlyTable algorithm, otherwise execute step 2 Step 2: Traverse Interested table, the method is as follows Traverse the line Tabling of the Interest table and Queuing, if they have the same itemset, then we execute step 3, otherwise we execute step 4 Step 3: Set Has accessed of Tabling to 1; Set the first ID flag of Tabling to 1 ;Add the frequency of Tabling to the frequency of Queuing; Traversing all the ?hildren nodes of Tabling with the method of Child1 ;Traversmg the pass mark of Tabling with the method of Child2. Get the Itemsets and the frequency in the Tabling and save in the result array, then we execute step 1 Step 4: If the Has accessed of Tabling is 1, G?t the Itemset and the frequency in the Tabling and save m the result array, then we execute step 2, Else set the Has accessed of Tabling to 1, deal with the Pass mark of Tabling 


with the method of Child2, Get the Itemsets and the frequency in the Tabling and save in the result array, then we execute step 2 Methods of OnlyTable Step 1: Remove an element \(Tabling table. If Tabling is not null, then we execute step 2 otherwise end of the algorithm Step 2: Traversal the Pass mark of Tabling with the method of Child2.Get the Itemset and the frequency in the Tabling and save in the result array, then we execute step 1 Methods of Child1 Add the frequency of each child node of Tabling to the frequency of Tabling, According to the ID of Tabling, mark the position located with the number of ID by 1 in each child nodes. Then, execute AddSign method Methods ofChild2 Step 1: Get an object Signing in the Pass mark, if Signing is empty, then the algorithm is ended. Otherwise, execute step 2 Step 2: Get the ID of Signing, and judge the firstlD bit of Tabling flag is whether 1 or not, if it is we execute step 3 otherwise we execute step 4 Step 3: Add the Signing directly to the Pass mark of all children of Tabling, and then execute step 1 Step 4:Make the first ID position of the flags of Tabling add the frequency of the Tabling with the Count of Signing add the Signing directly to the Pass mark of all children of Tabling, then execute step 1 Methods of AddSign Construct an object of Sign types; set its Count to the frequency of Tabling; set its ID to the ID of Tabling. To the object loaded into the pass mark under the appropriate Thirdly: Concentrated in the frequent item excavated to meet the requirements of the association rules Note: There is a marked number TSign in the interested table, we use TSign to mark the line of Interest table which has traversed IV. THE EXPERIMENT AND ANALYSIS A. The Improved Algorithm Flowchart At the beginning, input the target data table and interested items and construct the interested item table and target data queue. Then scan interested items table and 


modify the related items as elements pop-up from the queue constantly. Finally, traverse the interested items table, output the frequency of each item, get the frequent itemsets according to the given minimum support degree and excavate the association rule which has the minimum confidence from the frequent itemsets. Child1 and Child2 are as mentioned above.

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF IMPROVED ALGORITHM The algorithm introduced in this paper can greatly improve the mining efficiency. Firstly, the improved scan the database only once; secondly, it reduces a lot of unnecessary operations. The Improved mining algorithm has lower time complexity as it has explicit object. We test the traditional algorithm and the improved one based on the same situation that all the data are from Table I, and lead to the results showed on Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 showed that improved algorithm improved a lot on time. When it comes to the case that the transaction database is huge and the bigger interested items, the improved algorithm runs much better. Figure 3 showed operate times to complete the excavation when the interest items are different \(A, AB ABC 3.5

CONCLUSION We reach a conclusion after an analysis on Apriori algorithm: \(l 2 reduce unnecessary duplication of effort. Experiments showed that the algorithm in this paper can get the target to improve the efficiency. The algorithm also has its disadvantages, as we need larger memory to shore the flag bit when interested items increase ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China \(Grant No. 60773008 of Aerospace Information Security and Trust Computing of Ministry of Education., National Science Foundation for Post-doctoral Scientists of China, Natural Science Foundation ofHubei Province REFERENCES 1] T.Uno, M.Kiyomi,and H.Arimura.

A. Constrained Tree Edit Distance CTED [10] is based upon the idea of transforming one hierarchy into another via certain local editing operations The distance between two hierarchies is the minimum total number of operations needed for transforming the one into the other. Three modification operations are considered: A node i is deleted by transmitting its children to its parent and removing i from the hierarchy. Inserting is the complement of deleting: Inserting i as a child of j makes i the parent of some subset of the children of j. Changing a node means changing its label. In order to make computation in polynomial time possible, the constraint that disjoint subtrees have to be mapped to disjoint subtrees is included in the definition [10], [16 The original definition does not include any normalization For two hierarchies with q labels each, 2q is the highest possible CTED  corresponding to deleting all labels of the first hierarchy and inserting all labels of the second hierarchy We normalize the CTED by 12q which results in distances in 0, 1 B. Taxonomic Overlap TO [11] compares the nodes of two hierarchies according to how many ancestors and descendants they share. We describe a version adapted to our experiments. Define semantic cotopy as SC\(i,H i j Given two hierarchies H1 and H2, the corresponding overlap for i ? L is defined as O\(i,H1, H2 SC\(i,H1 i,H2 SC\(i,H1 i,H2 Note that this is a symmetric expression in H1 and H2 with values in [0, 1]. The TO of H1 and H2 is the average of all overlaps TO\(H1, H2 1 q  i?L O\(i,H1, H2 For two identical hierarchies, TO is 1, while it is 0 if H1 and H2 are totally unrelated. Since the two other hierarchy 


proximity measures used in the experiments are distances with smaller values indicating higher similarity TO? := 1? TO to simplify comparisons C. LCA-Path Tree Distance Since in a hierarchy a parent is a more general concept than any of its children, the locations of the same label i in two hierarchies H1 and H2 can be compared by how far one has to travel up the chain of ancestors in both hierarchies until a common ancestor is found. For a label i ? L the depth dH\(i 0 dH\(i pH\(i a1, . . . , av the ancestors of i in H1, such that a1 = pH1\(i a2 = pH1\(a1 i common ancestor of i in H1 and H2, lca\(i,H1, H2 first ancestor of i in H1 which is also an ancestor of i in H2 j? := min  j | j ? {1, . . . , v} such that aj ? AH2\(i  lca\(i,H1, H2 Since 0 is an ancestor of all labels in all hierarchies, the LCA always exists. Note that usually lca\(i,H1, H2 lca\(i,H2, H1 We use the LCA to measure how far apart the positions of a label in both hierarchies are: If a label i has the same parent in both hierarchies it is regarded as being in the same position, otherwise the distances of i to its LCA in both hierarchies are used to measure how far apart both locations are. The cost for i is defined as d\(i,H1, H2 2 k=1 dHk\(i lca\(i,H1, H2 D\(i,H1, H2  0, if pH1\(i i d\(i,H1, H2 8 This can be seen as the length of the path from i to lca\(i,H1, H2 i,H1, H2 As D is not symmetric, the complete LCA-path distance 


between H1 and H2 is the mean value D\(H1, H2 1 W  i?L 1 2  D\(i,H1, H2 i,H2, H1  0 1 2 3 a 0 2 1 3 b Fig. 3.

Comparison All three hierarchy proximity measures presented above reflect different concepts of tree similarity. It is thus not surprising that CTED and TO*, although they perform well in the domains they were designed for, may produce counterintuitive results when used in the field of HE. This is demonstrated by the hierarchies shown in Figure 3: Despite the fact that the relationships between the nodes in both hierarchies are completely different, their CTED and TO are 0.33 and 0.44, respectively. Their LCAPD, on the other hand, is 1.00. Thus only LCAPD marks both hierarchies with the highest possible distance Some hierarchies used in our experiments contain nodes with exactly one child \(single-child labels that TO* does not distinguish between such labels and their children, in the following sense: Given a hierarchy H and a single-child node i, we denote with H ? the hierarchy 


that is obtained from H by swapping i and its child. Then TO?\(H,H CTED or LCAPD V. EXPERIMENTS We tested the proposed data mining system with four multi-label classifiers: ML-FAM, ML-ARAM, ML-kNN and BoosTexter on three real-world datasets with increasing complexity from the text-mining field. In our experiments we compared extracted hierarchies to the original hierarchy by means of three hierarchy proximity measures: LCAPD CTED, and TO The experimental setup of ML-FAM and ML-ARAM had the following parameter values: choice parameter 0.0001; learning rates ?a,b = 1.0 for fast learning; vigilance parameters ?a = 0.9 and ?b = 1.0. The parameter t was chosen to be 0.05 for the 20 newsgroups dataset and 0.02 for the other datasets. The number of voters V was set to 9 Following [8], we used 10 nearest neighbors \(k = 10 Laplace smoothing \(s = 1 BoosTexter was trained using 500 boosting rounds as in 8] and the threshold for converting rankings into multi-labels was set to 0 [9 A. Multi-label Classification Performance Measures We used a large set of performance measures for evaluation of the MC experiments: First, two example-based measures for multi-label predictions: Accuracy \(A measure \(F  of the predicted labels are actually present while F-measure is the harmonic mean of precision and recall calculated on the per-instance basis. The larger the A and F values, the better the MC performance Then two label-based measures were calculated on the basis of binary counts for each label: the numbers of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives We used the micro-averaged version of F1 with the binary measures counted on the whole test set. The perfect performance corresponds to F1 = 1. Additionally, micro-averaged precision and recall were used for computing the Area Under a Precision-Recall Curve \(AUPRC  precision corresponds to the proportion of predicted labels in the test set that are correct and recall to the proportion of labels that are correctly predicted. AUPRC has been claimed 


to be a well-suited performance measure for MC tasks where the number of negative instances significantly exceeds the number of positive instances [6]. Another advantage of AUPRC is its global nature and independence of a certain threshold value. The closer the AUPRC value is to 1, the better the performance Since these measures are based on the comparison of multi-labels, they depend on a transformation from rankings to classes. As a contrast we also used four wellknown ranking-based performance measures: One-Error OE RL C cision \(AP  for all ranking-based performance measures except AP. OneError evaluates how many times the top-ranked label is not in the set of proper labels of the instance. Ranking Loss is defined as the average fraction of pairs of labels that are ordered incorrectly. Coverage evaluates how far we need, on average, to go down the list of labels in order to cover all the proper labels of the instance. Average Precision evaluates the average fraction of labels ranked above a particular label i ? mt which actually are in mt And finally, the special hierarchical loss function H-loss 2] were utilized. Following [3], normalized costs were calculated: ci := 1/|c\(p\(i i ? L i of all direct children of i. Hierarchical loss \(H-loss consider mistakes made in subtrees of incorrectly predicted labels and penalizes only the first mistake along the path from the root to a node. The smaller the H-loss value, the better the performance B. 20 Newsgroups Dataset We modified the popular single-label dataset 20 Newsgroups [18], [19] by considering eight additional labels corresponding to the intermediate levels of the hierarchy faith, recreation, recreation/sport, recreation/vehicles, politics, computer, computer/hardware, science. This dataset is a collection of almost 20,000 postings from 20 newsgroups sorted by date into training \(60 40 data were preprocessed by discarding all words appearing only in the test documents and all words found in the stop word list [20]. Afterwards, all but the 2%-most-frequent words were eliminated to reduce the dimensionality. Documents were represented using the well-known TF-IDF \(Term 


Frequency  Inverse Document Frequency scheme [19]. The TF-IDF weights were then normalized to the range of [0, 1]. Conversion to TF-IDF and normalization were performed separately for training and test data. This resulted in the 1,070-dimensional dataset with 11,256 training instances, 7,493 test ones and 28 labels To test the performance of two HE algorithms, we first extracted hierarchies from the True Test Multi-Labels \(TTML and calculated the corresponding proximity measures. Both algorithms successfully extracted the original hierarchy We studied the performance of the multi-label classifiers and their ability to infer the class hierarchies in the presence of only partly available hierarchical information. We performed a series of HE experiments with multi-labels having a decreasing number of inserted non-leaf labels describing the levels in the hierarchy. We randomly removed such labels from 20%, 30%, and 40% of the training instances leaving them single-labeled. The results for predicted test multilabels are shown in Table I where the bold face marks the best classifier, and the first column \(left result of HE by Voting and the second \(right Thresholding \(referred as GT Comparing classification performance, one can see that the ART-based networks are superior to both the other classifiers in terms of most performance measures and that ML-FAM slightly outperforms ML-ARAM. Taken together they win on at least 6 and at most 8 out of 9 evaluation measures. BoosTexter has the second best performance, but its predictive power degrades more quickly with the increase in the number of single-label instances. The poorest MC results were shown by ML-kNN, its performance decreased very fast with any reduction in the number of multi-labels For example, F1 decreased by 15% while removing 40% of labels instead of 30%. It is also interesting to note that when trained on the dataset with 40% removed labels, ML-FAM and ML-ARAM significantly outperformed ML-kNN trained on the original dataset with all labels The hierarchy proximity measures confirm the good quality of predictions produced by the ART-based networks: The hierarchies were correct extracted by both HE algorithms of Section II-B even with 40% removed labels. The predictions of ML-kNN were the worst: The Voting variant of the HE 


algorithm could not extract the correct hierarchy with 30 assigning five labels incorrectly to the root label. None of the HE algorithms could extract the correct hierarchy in the absence of 40% multi-labels. With 40% and Voting, the number of labels falsely assigned to the root was 13, while with GT it was only three. For BoosTexter, Voting assigned two labels wrongly to the root label in the experiment with TABLE I 20 NEWSGROUPS ALL, -20%, -30% AND -40% RESULTS Measure all 20% 30% 40%ARAM FAM kNN BoosT.

GT resulted in zero distances in the both cases. Assigning more labels to the root creates more shallow and wider hierarchies \(trivial case as stated before The good hierarchy extraction with ART networks demonstrates the system robustness  even with strongly damaged data the system can rebuild the original hierarchy C. RCV1-v2 Dataset The next experiment was based on the tokenized version of 


the RCV1-v2 dataset introduced in [21]. Only the topics label set consisting of 103 labels arranged in a hierarchy of depth four is examined here. Documents of the original training set of 23,149 were converted to TF-IDF weights and normalized Afterwards the set was splitted in 15,000 randomly selected documents as training and the remaining as test samples In this case, the Voting variant of HE applied to the TTML resulted in the LCAPD, CTED and TO* values 0.12, 0.15 and 0.13, respectively. The corresponding values of the GT variant are 0.05, 0.07 and 0.05. The poor performance of the Voting method is due to the fact that for the TTML only very high threshold values succeed in removing enough noise The Voting results are thus dominated by bad hierarchies extracted for all but the highest thresholds The classification and HE results for this dataset are shown in Table II. ML-ARAM has better performance results on this data set in all points than ML-FAM except for RL being the best of all classifiers in terms of the multi-label performance measures. BoosTexter is the best in terms of all ranking measures For both HE algorithms the distances of BoosTexter are the best, those of ML-FAM second, followed ML-ARAM and ML-kNN. All three distance measures correlate. Interesting is also that for ML-kNN the distance values obtained by both HE methods are almost the same The hierarchy extracted by GT from the TTML has much lower distances values as compared with the hierarchies extracted by both methods from predicted multi-labels. This reflects a specific problem of HE, since only a small fraction of the incorrectly classified multi-labels can prevent building of a proper hierarchy. For example, 16.5% of misassigned labels in the extracted hierarchy are responsible for about 80% of LCAPD calculated from the predictions of MLARAM. This large part of the HE error is caused by only 4% of the test data. Under these circumstances the other distances behave analogically. Most labels were not assigned making them trivial edges, but six labels were assigned to a false branch. This can happen when labels have a strong correlation and in the step Hierarchy Construction of the basic algorithm the parent is not unique in the confidence matrix. BoosTexters results suffer less from this problem because it generally sets more labels for each test sample 


Both HE algorithms behaved similarly on the predictions of the ART networks. They constructed a deeper hierarchy than the original one and wrongly assigned the same 11 labels to the root node. The higher distances come from Voting assigning more labels to the wrong branch. For MLkNN both algorithms again create very similar hierarchy trees, both misassigned 28 labels to the root label. For BoosTexter it was seven with Voting and eight with GT Voting produced a deeper hierarchy here D. WIPO-alpha Dataset The WIPO-alpha dataset1 comprises patent documents collected by the World Intellectual Property Organization WIPO ments. Preprocessing was performed as follows: From each document, the title, abstract and claims texts were extracted stop words were removed using the list from [20] and words were stemmed using the Snowball stemmer [22]. All but the 1%-most-frequent stems were removed, the remaining stems were converted to TF-IDF weights and these were normalized to the range of [0, 1]. Again, TF-IDF conversion and normalization were done independently for the training and the test set. The original hierarchy consists, from top to bottom, of 8 sections, 120 classes, 630 subclasses and about 69,000 groups. In our experiment, only records from the sections A \(5802 training and 5169 test samples H \(5703 training and 5926 test samples 1http://www.wipo.int/classifications/ipc/en/ITsupport/Categorization dataset/wipo-alpha-readme.html August 2009 TABLE II RCV1-V2 RESULTS Measure ARAM FAM kNN BoosT A 0.748 0.731 0.651 0.695 F1 0.795 0.777 0.735 0.769 F 0.805 0.787 0.719 0.771 OE 0.077 0.089 0.104 0.063 RL 0.087 0.086 0.026 0.015 C 11.598 11.692 8.563 5.977 AP 0.868 0.860 0.839 0.873 AUPRC 0.830 0.794 0.807 0.838 H-loss 0.068 0.077 0.097 0.081 Wins 4 0 0 5 LCAPD 0.29 0.22 0.25 0.20 0.34 0.34 0.21 0.18

Both main and secondary codes were used in the experiment, although codes pointing to groups outside of sections A and H were ignored. We also removed groups that did not contain at least 30 training and 30 test records \(and any documents that only belonged to such small groups 7,364 test records with 924 attributes each and a label set of size 131 In this case, the Voting variant of the HE algorithm applied to the TTML resulted in the LCAPD, CTED and TO* values of 0.13, 0.12 and 0, respectively. GT showed the same values. Remarkable are the TO* distances, which are equal to 0. This is due to the fact that the WIPO-alpha hierarchy contains 16 single-child labels that are not partitioned by the true multi-labels: whenever a single-child label j is contained in a multi-label, so is its child, and vice versa. It is therefore theoretically impossible to deduce from the multilabels which of them is the parent of the other. As a result the HE algorithms often choose the wrong parent, resulting in higher LCAPD and CTED values. TO*, as described above is invariant under such choices The results obtained on the WIPO-alpha dataset are shown in Table III. The classification performance of the ART-based networks on this dataset is slightly worse than that of BoosTexter. Mostly in the terms of OE, RL, C, AP, AUPRC, and H-loss measures BoosTexter is better because its rankings are better and it assigned more labels to each sample. But the ART networks have better HE results because their predicted labels are more consistent with the original hierarchy. MLkNN has the worst classification results and distance values again. The reason for the high relative difference between LCAPD as well as CTED and TO* obtained for the ART networks or BoosTexter as compared to the results of the other datasets is because most of the labels were assigned in the right branch but not exactly where they belong Both HE algorithms extracted the same hierarchy from the predictions of ML-ARAM and a very similar hierarchy for ML-FAM. About 5% labels were assigned wrongly to the 


root label in the hierarchies of the ART networks.

Here, GT extracted a much worse hierarchy as shown by CTED being 0.15 higher for GT than for Voting For BoosTexter both HE methods built the same hierarchy and no label was wrongly assigned to the root. All extracted hierarchies were one level deeper than the original one Although Voting produced worse hierarchies than GT on two previous datasets, this time its distance values were comparable or even better. In comparison to Voting, GT has higher values for all distances on the multi-labels of MLkNN. Voting has the advantage of being a much simpler method and of being more dataset independent. Still the tree distances have the same ranking order for all classifiers for both HE methods VI. CONCLUSION In this paper we studied Hierarchical Multi-label Classification \(HMC tive was to derive hierarchical relationships between output classes from predicted multi-labels automatically. We have developed a data-mining-system based on two recently proposed multi-label extensions of the FAM and ARAM neural networks: ML-FAM and ML-ARAM as well as on a Hierarchy Extraction \(HE algorithm builds association rules from label co-occurrences 


and has two modifications. The presented approach is general enough to be used with any other multi-label classifier or HE algorithm. We have also developed a new tree distance measure for quantitative comparison of hierarchies In extensive experiments made on three text-mining realworld datasets, ML-FAM and ML-ARAM were compared against two state-of-the-art multi-label classifiers: ML-kNN and BoosTexter. The experimental results confirm that the proposed approach is suitable for extracting middle and large-scale class hierarchies from predicted multi-labels.

Dataset procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the US census data set. The results are also similar to the experiment results for association rule mining: there is a consistent trade off between the estimation variance and sampling cost by setting their weights. Our proposed methods have better performance than simple random sampling method 


We also evaluated the performance of our methods on the Yahoo! dataset. The size of pilot sampling is 2000, and the xed value x for the sample size is 200. The attribute price is considered as the target attribute. Figure 4 shows the performance of the 5 sampling procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the Yahoo! dataset. The results are very similar to those from the previous experiments VI. RELATED WORK We now compare our work with the existing work on sampling for association rule mining, sampling for database aggregation queries, and sampling for the deep web Sampling for Association Rule Mining: Sampling for frequent itemset mining and association rule mining has been studied by several researchers [23], [21], [11], [6]. Toivonen [23] proposed a random sampling method to identify the association rules which are then further veri?ed on the entire database. Progressive sampling [21], which is based on equivalence classes, involves determining the required sample size for association rule mining FAST [11], a two-phase sampling algorithm, has been proposed to select representative transactions, with the goal of reducing computation cost in association rule mining.A randomized counting algorithm [6] has been developed based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo method for counting the number of frequent itemsets Our work is different from these sampling methods, since we consider the problem of association rule mining on the deep web. Because the data records are hidden under limited query interfaces in these systems, sampling involves very distinct challenges Sampling for Aggregation Queries: Sampling algorithms have also been studied in the context of aggregation queries on large data bases [18], [1], [19], [25]. Approximate Pre-Aggregation APA  categorical data utilizing precomputed statistics about the dataset Wu et al. [25] proposed a Bayesian method for guessing the extreme values in a dataset based on the learned query shape pattern and characteristics from previous workloads More closely to our work, Afrati et al. [1] proposed an adaptive sampling algorithm for answering aggregation queries on hierarchical structures. They focused on adaptively adjusting the sample size assigned to each group based on the estimation error in each group. Joshi et al.[19] considered the problem of 


estimating the result of an aggregate query with a very low selectivity. A principled Bayesian framework was constructed to learn the information obtained from pilot sampling for allocating samples to strata Our methods are clearly distinct for these approaches. First strata are built dynamically in our algorithm and the relations between input and output attributes are learned for sampling on output attributes. Second, the estimation accuracy and sampling cost are optimized in our sample allocation method Hidden Web Sampling: There is recent research work [3 13], [15] on sampling from deep web, which is hidden under simple interfaces. Dasgupta et al.[13], [15] proposed HDSampler a random walk scheme over the query space provided by the interface, to select a simple random sample from hidden database Bar-Yossef et al.[3] proposed algorithms for sampling suggestions using the public suggestion interface. Our algorithm is different from their work, since our goal is sampling in the context of particular data mining tasks. We focus on achieving high accuracy with a low sampling cost for a speci?c task, instead of simple random sampling VII. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have proposed strati?cation based sampling methods for data mining on the deep web, particularly considering association rule mining and differential rule mining Components of our approach include: 1 the relation between input attributes and output attributes of the deep web data source, 2 maximally reduce an integrated cost metric that combines estimation variance and sampling cost, and 3 allocation method that takes into account both the estimation error and the sampling costs Our experiments show that compared with simple random sampling, our methods have higher sampling accuracy and lower sampling cost. Moreover, our approach allows user to reduce sampling costs by trading-off a fraction of estimation error 332 6DPSOLQJ9DULDQFH
