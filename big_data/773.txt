To this aim we surveyed the retail advisory operations of Germany s largest banks. We find that standardization enhances efficiency, quality and control of the advisory process. Additionally, IT intensity on its own shows positive effects on efficiency and quality as well, while it leads to more customer facing time needed for a single customer. Also, the interaction effect with process standardization is relevant. We conclude that IT creates business value through facilitating process standardization and process control. Our results strongly indicate that managers have to look carefully at the type of the processes before standardizing it   1. Introduction  Both practitioners and researchers frequently argue that standardization of business processes is de 
sirable \(e.g becau s e it is e x pected to i m prove process efficiency and customer satisfaction and to enable interchangeability and compliance with regulations [17   Nevertheless, research has not yet offered a conclusive picture of the value of process standardization. In this paper, we address the following research questions What is the impact of business process standardization on business process performance?How does IT intensity affect this relationship  Our main goal is to explore this interplay between process standardization and IT business value As empirical application domain, we use quantitative data from a particular business process in the financial services industry, i.e. the financial advisory process, in order to test our hypotheses about the relationship between process standardization, IT intensity, and process performance. The results show that process standardization has not only a positive effect on process performance, but that it can act as an explanatory factor in the IT business value debate The remainder is structured as follows: section 2 develops the theoretical model, section 3 presents the empirical analysis, section 4 discusses the results while section 5 provides a conclusion and outlook  2.

Process Standardization  Much has been written on process standardization, and academics and practitioners clearly associate standardization with some sort of benefit [21, 42 Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 1 978-0-7695-3450-3/09 $25.00 © 2009 IEEE

Melville et gg est t h at a better un derstanding of the role of process standards can link research in the areas of standardization and IS business value Early contributions on the importance of standards in general underline the key role that standards and standardization have played in the evolution of information and communication technology, enabling compatibility and creating network effects [15, 20   The object of process standardization is a business process, according to Davenport and Sh  defined as a "set of logically related tasks performed to achieve a defined business outcome". Business processes consist of several sub-processes or activities that are \(logically\ orde red and outputs trying to achieve a defined business goal. Jang and Lee [27, p  i n e proces s s t an dardization  a s th e deg r ee to which work rules, policies, and operating procedures are formalised and followed". Process standardization ultimately defines a reference standard to which different versions of the business process, e.g. running in different business units, within the firm need to conform o n s eq u e n t l y  proces s s t an dardization is both the process and the result of achieving transparency and homogenization of business processes within a firm or even across multiple firm  the following, we restrict our research to a purely inner-organizational understanding of process standardization, i.e. we only intend to investigate the effect of inner-organizational process standardization on process performance Standardization research has so far largely focused on data and IT standards, and there is comparatively little literature regarding the impact of process standardization. Nevertheless, researchers have shown an increasing interest in the potential value of business process standardization. In the following sections, we review the literature which led to our research hypotheses  2.2. Impact of Process Standardization on Process Performance  Process standardization within a firm can improve operational performance and reduce processing costs by eliminating errors, by achieving economies of scale, and by facilitating communication  Often, firms use multiple process variants simultaneously and these variants might differ strongly with respect to efficiency, quality and cycle time. First standardizing these variants will most likely consolidate processing volumes and thereby allow the firm to exploit economies of scale. Moreover, business process outsourcing is facilitated, delivering additional efficiency gains [43 S econ d  proces s  standardization allows the identification and implementation of best practices throughout the firm. If the firm merges several variants of the same process, it can identify the variant showing the highest performance and apply this as the new process standard  Both arguments should hold even more strongly in the context of business process outsourcing or mergers & acquisitions er, fu rth e r proces s optimization activities can be applied more effectively to a standardized process [3  A potential downside of standardization might be a bureaucratization or the centralization of authority that eliminates managerial or individual discretion Authors lik a v e po in ted ou t in e f f i cie n cies created by \(excess\ bureaucracy Process standardization is often accompanied by a higher degree of IT support or automation. The sequence of activities along the business process is embedded into a supporting information system \(e.g workflow management system or an ERP system which controls for the compliance of process instances with the process standard Standardization of the financial advisory process in the retail banking industry involves different parts of the banking organization, including e.g. the branches of the network or the data processing center It aims at creating standardized ways to carry out the front office customer facing process In the context of financial advisory processes, a standardized and IT-supported advisory process for the advisors with a branch, and for the branches within a banking organization, can reduce the average time spent on preparing and post-processing advisory interviews. This is equivalent to IT increasing the labor productivity, enabling the advisor to conduct more interviews in a given time In service industries in particluar, standardization offers compliance with regulations and improved customer confiden a m ple, t h e bank i n g industry is a highly regulated environment, and there are an increasing number of legal norms which have to be followed within the financial advisory process In this context, process standardization and IT support help to implement and to maintain an advisory process that is compliant with regulatory requirements. As an example, the required assessment of an advisee s risk attitude, and the standardized followup preparation of the minutes of the advisory interview might be implemented into the system. Additionally, a standardized advisory process may help individual investors to come to better investment Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 2 


decisions. A clearly structured advisory interview produces investment recommendations based on a sound target asset allocation. This additional guidance within a standardized process can help employees not to miss certain elements of the data collection, which could otherwise lead to an inferior outcome of the process in terms of quality. Moreover the advisory process involves several business units with more or less centralization \(decentralized sales units, centralized back office for post-processing the advisory interview results\. Process standardization helps to reduce errors, problems and conflicts occurring at the interfaces between the different business units In contrast to other studies, which measure process performance as a single construct \(e.g  which aggregate several dimensions into a higherorder construct \(e.g w e  w ill e x plicitl y  inv e s tigate the impact of process standardization on all three basic dimensions of process performance: process efficiency, process quality, and processing time   Hypothesis H1: Process standardization will increase process performance in terms of efficiency \(a time \(b\, and quality \(c  2.3. Mediating Impact of Control  Using process standards not only increases efficiency by utilizing economies of scale and identifying best practice, but also reduces complexity [13, 16  u s allo w i ng better coordin a tion an d m o n itoring. For example, within a banking organization, it would be easier to compare the outcomes of different advisory interviews conducted by different employees if they had to follow a standardized process with standardized data to enter in a centralized information system. Thus, the standardization of the advisory process will enable improved control of advisor activities, enabling banks to manage the sales and distribution of financial products more effectively In their study of BPO success, Wüllenweber et al  u e d th at proces s  s t an dardization leads to higher transparency, which facilitates control and contract completeness, which in turn leads to higher BPO success. Based on agency theory, we claim that this mediating effect of measurability also exists in an intra-firm contex s t an dardized proc es s allows an easier definition and monitoring of key performance indicators \(KPIs\, offering the chance to react quickly to unexpected negative changes in KPIs to keep quality, efficiency, and time at the desired levels. Process standardization leads to higher transparency, which facilitates control, and, thus, drives process performance  Hypothesis 2: Standardization is positively related to process control  Hypothesis 3: Control is positively related to process performance in terms of efficiency \(a\, time b\, and quality \(c  2.4. IT Intensity  The literature on IT usage suggests that usage explains the impact of info rmation technology on process performance, and that the so-called productivity paradox might be caused by omission of usage variables in prior research design  Generally, there are very few studies analyzing the performance of IT investment in banking firms at all. Markus and Soh x a m in e t h e correlation between spending on IT and profitability in the US banking industry and find that only a small fraction of banks actually achieve clear financial benefit from spending on IT, and that the results depend on banks size. Similar results are found in the European banking market by B B y con t rast, Dav a m a nirajan d Ha y n e s  T h o m ps o n 24] f i n d e v i dence that IT creates positive productivity benefits Focusing on the role of IT usage, Wagner et al show that this variable is an important explanatory factor for the achievement of process performance [4 49, 50 th eir an al y s is o f t h e Ger m a n bank ing  m a r ket, they study the effect of different organizational capabilities and show that IT usage is nearly as important as business expertise for superior process performance in the banking business  Hypothesis 4: IT intensity is positively related to process performance in terms of efficiency \(a\, time b\, and quality \(c\ as well as to process control \(d  Above, we have already argued that process standardization is facilitated by IT and that the benefits from process standardization, both in terms of efficiency and control, are more likely if the process is strongly supported by IT and if the process workflows are embedded in IT systems. Consequently, we conjecture a complementary relationship between IT intensity and process standardization, modeled as a moderating effect of IT intensity on the impact of process standardization on process performan  Hypothesis 5: IT intensity will positively moderate the direct effect of process standardization on process performance in terms of efficiency \(a\, time \(b and quality \(c\ as well as the effect on control \(d  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 3 


3. Analysis  3.1. Unit of Analysis  Empirically, this paper analyzes the role of process standardization and IT support for the performance of the financial advisory process in German banks. Retail banking is a highly regulated industry with largely commoditized products where process standardization is potentially beneficial. The advisory process is ideal for our research as German banks believe there is great potential for standardization and efficiency gains , and plan to significantly enhance IT support for this process in the near futu  T h e re-engineering of the advisory process is likely to be the next step in the ongoing redesign of the banking value chains where, after the back-office, banks are now beginning to industrialize their front-office activities. The financial advisory process can be divided into five phases: assessment of customer needs and goals, asset allocation, product selection, transaction and follow-up s t ep  on e, inv e s t ors  h a v e to determine their current financial situation, taking into consideration not only current assets and liabilities but also expected future cash flows. The review of the investor s situation is completed with an assessment of individual risk aversion, investment goals and investment horizon. Step two is when the investor s situation and goals are mapped to an individual allocation to specific asset classes strategic asset allocation ree is the selection of specific securities from the asset classes tactical asset allocation step four, the selected security has to be purchased or sold. In step five, the portfolio has to be monitored and adjusted regularly IT can contribute to the financial advisory process throughout every phase. For example, in order to systematically determine the customer s current financial situation, a supporting technical system might visualize the customer s current portfolio. IT supported sample portfolios might assist in the asset allocation, for instance by simulating the impact of an investment on the risk of a customer portfolio. IT can, furthermore, be a powerful tool in enabling customer advisors to permanently monitor the performance of customer portfolios. But, ultimately, the IT support of the advisory process requires individualization depending on the range of financial products offered and the customer segments of the bank      3.2. Approach  To test our hypotheses, our research model has been operationalized and transferred into a structural equation model in order to be analyzed with the Partial Least Squares \(PLS\ach  The data for this analysis comes from a survey among the top 500 German banks conducted in the first quarter of 2007. The participating banks were chosen based on their total assets in 2006. The 500 largest banks in Germany were contacted by telephone in order to identify the head of the advisory department. The questionnaire together with a prepaid, self-addressed envelope was then mailed to the managers identified. Six weeks later, all nonresponding banks were called again and encouraged to participate. After entering the data into a data base consistency of the data was verified by a second individual Our survey of the top 500 German banks resulted in 65 completed and usable questionnaires, equivalent to a response rate of about 13.0 percent. The sample covers savings banks, cooperative banks and private institutions, and nearly matches the distribution in the market. Furthermore, the sample is representative of the German banking market by size of the responding banks in terms of total assets. Finally the sample covers all federal states and thus represents banks from every region of Germany The survey questionnaire was designed on the basis of a comprehensive literature review and in cooperation with the leading German provider for financial market data and customized IT solutions for financial service providers. A series of interviews with top executives of the company provided a framework for identifying the range of well-known information technologies used in the financial advisory process Furthermore, the questionnaire was pre-tested several times with various bank managers who did not later participate in the survey The first independent variable process standardization is measured with regard to internal business process standardization and not with respect to external industry reference processes. Therefore, we used three questions in order to assess whether the steps in a business process are mandatory, have mandatory content, and are standardized [13, 38, 42, 52, 53  For the second independent variable IT intensity  we developed a new scale based on Powell and DentMicallef h ic h m a tc h e s w i t h  ou r application domain. It identifies all \(potentially\ available information technologies a bank has implemented to support the financial advisory process and records the actual usage of the available technologies. Out of the 23 items regarding all information technologies in a Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 4 


bank, we used 3 items about the information systems regarding the portfolio of a customer. We asked 3 questions about the existence of an IT system for different tasks in the advisory process on a multi-item scale \(integrated solution; isolated application; local application; no IT support; do not know\ addition we asked 3 questions about the same tasks on another multi-item scale \(yes, very often; yes, often; no, but desirable; no, not desirable\ in order to assess the intensity of the tasks supported by the IT systems Finally, IT intensity is measured by combining the 6 questions regarding the existence of an IT system and the use to 3 items. The items are about the possibility to access the structure of customers portfolios, to visualize the structure of their portfolios and to show the performance of the portfolio. So each of the 3 items represents the combined answer of the existence of an IT system and the use of it for one of the two tasks This study relies on self-reported IT usage, which provides an important indicator in assessing how intensively IT is used within an organization. We are aware that there are limitations to the accuracy of self-reported usage measurem W e treated  answers of do not know regarding the IT support as no IT support  The dependent variable in this study is the relative performance of the financial advisory process. There are two possible approaches to measuring the level of advisory process performance across banks. First quantitative productivity measures such as process cycle time could be used. The second option is to assess the quality of the output of this process. In this study, we combine both approaches in order to understand the impact of IT on the relative performance of this process across competing firms. As a quantitative performance measure, the survey captures the process cycle time of the advisory interview with two items on metric scales. Please note that we grouped the quantitative answers \(stated in number of minutes\d coded them inversely to emphasize the performance aspect of the time dimension: the shorter the time, the higher the performance. Therefore, a positive influence on time means an improvement of this dimension, which results in shorter process time. The recoding leads to all three dimensions having the same orientation The remaining dimensions of process performance, quality and efficiency, were measured qualitatively with two formative items for each latent variable. The appendix provides a table with all indicators used    3.3. Results  Before we present and discuss our results, we deal with non-response bias and common method bias and control for the validity and reliability of the PLS measurement models  3.3.1. Non-response Bias and Common Method Bias   We followed Armstrong and Overton y co m paring the early with the late respondents in order to test for a non-response bias To that end we divided those respondents who answered all relevant questions into two groups: \(1\he first 31 respondents were treated as early respondents and \(2\e last 34 respondents were treated as late respondents Comparing the questionnaires of these two groups using the Mann-Whitney test showed no significant differences for any of the items used Common method bias If both the criterion variables and the predictor are taken from only one source, it could happen that the variance would originate in the measurement method instead of the constructs represented by the measur order to  cope with common method bias, Podsakoff et al. [3  suggest procedural and statistical remedies. We concentrated on procedural remedies due to countering acquiescence effects with reverse-coded items; we ensured the anonymity of respondents to offset social desirability effects; we eliminated ambiguous or complex items from our survey by using pre-tests and we used different scales for the different constructs Likert scales, multi-item scales\including metrics processing times\. As a statistical remedy we applied Harman s one-factor test h ich did n o t produce one single factor which would account for the majority of variance of all used items  3.3.1. Measurement Model   We tested our model based on reflective and formative measures. Hence, the PLS measurement model was examined with respect to content validity, indicator reliability and construct validity Content validity defines the degree to which a construct reflects the supposed meaning in its measuremen ensured content validity by developing questions for indicators taken from preceding research as well as by adaptation or elimination of individual questions as a result of ambiguities found in pre-tests Indicator reliability deals with the linkage between an indicator and its corresponding construct We applied PLS bootstrapping with 500 samples to Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 5

First, the square root of the    1 Formative measures  AVE \(shown in the shaded cells of Table 3 of every construct is greater than the inter-correlations between the latent variables. This indicates a good fit between the measurement items and their latent variables   Table 3: Correlations of Latent Variables and AVE Square Root \(Shaded Cells   PS IT Intensity Control Time Efficiency PS 0.818  IT Intensity 0.224 0.857    Control 0.182 0.089 0.909  Time -0.150 0.230 0.079   Efficiency 0.414 0.210 0.652 0.082  Quality 0.310 0.258 0.331 0.145 0.493  Second, we examined the cross-loadings between indicators and found that all indicators used in our analysis are in accordance with the required high loadings for their associated constructs, while having low loadings for the other constructs After having validated our measurement models the next section analyzes the causal relationships with regard to the PLS structural model   3.3.2.

Discussion and Limitations  Overall, the results from our PLS calculation based on data on the advisory process of German banks seem to support the propositions claimed by this paper. Process standardization has a significant positive impact on process performance, both in a direct manner \(leading to higher efficiency and quality, e.g. by achieving economies of scale, identifying best practices, etc.\nd in an indirect way, mediated by facilitating control capabilities, as also shown by Wüllenwe er, I T p o sitiv el y  moderates the most effects of process standardization But, when focusing on the details, we find some deviations from this overall picture. One of the first results which needs to be discussed is the negative link between IT intensity and the time dimension of process performance. The most likely explanation for this is that time was measured by the customer facing time of the advisory process. Since we focused on the use and existence of information systems regarding the analysis of customers portfolios, the use of these additional information systems in the customer advisory process is more time-consuming than when the advisor can skip this additional tasks. If the measurement model focused on other kinds of IT support in the advisory process, the results would likely change The insignificant path between process standardization and time can be explained analogously. Despite the fact that this relationship is not significant, it can be assumed that a standardized process requires the advisor to follow a pre-specified path through the information system when consulting the customer accessing her portfolio structure, visualizing the structure of her portfolio, and showing the performance of her portfolio\ithout having the option to individualize, i.e. shorten, the data collection procedure Consequently, the question that arises is that of the relationship between time and the remaining dimensions of process performance: quality and efficiency. If more customer facing time was related to higher quality and customer satisfaction, the trade-off between efficiency \(time as resource consumption and quality \(time as a value contributor\would have to be optimized by the banks. In the other case, if there was no positive relation, the question would arise of how customer facing time can be reduced, in order to increase efficiency and maybe even customer satisfaction. In environments with high IT intensity this has to be achieved by adapted information systems which allow for more flexibility and bypasses along the advisory process Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 


For future research, the implication of this result would be that the type of business process investigated determines the process performance measures It is not always about time, cost, and quality. For example, when comparing this study with  becomes clear that we are focusing on a customeroriented core or primary process while v e s t i gated a back-office process where time per task means something different Our hypotheses also find support from our study of the interaction between process standardization and IT intensity. The PLS results provide evidence that banks with comparatively high IT usage can improve the direct and indirect positive effects of process standardization on quality \(H5c\d time H5b\ well as on control \(H5d\ particular, the greatly increased impact of process standardization on control \(H5d\eals the potential effect of the interplay between standardization and IT intensity on the dimensions of process performance through the strong mediating effect of c ontrol on efficiency \(H3a and quality \(H3c\ain, we can draw on our argument that it depends largely on the type of business process investigated. In a sales process like the advisory process, process quality will be the most important dimension since it leads to customer satisfaction much more than time or efficiency do \(the latter could even be related negatively with customer satisfaction\. Since a sales process is directly associated with customers and their perceptions, process \(or service\uality is critical, and all optimization initiatives, such as process standardization, introducing new IT etc., will have to focus primarily on this dimension of process performance However, when interpreting the results, we are faced with some limitations: \(1\e analyzed only one specific business process \(namely the advisory process\ just one industry \(the banking industry in only one country \(Germany\ just one point in time, which reduces the generalizability of our findings; \(2\he model is based on a relatively small sample size \(65 cases for the entire sample\which needs to be kept in mind, particularly for the group comparison; \(3\he operationalization of process standardization at the same time as process performance is quite difficult. Therefore, we have chosen to model three sub dimensions of process performance and to concentrate only on business internal process standardization, but not on reference processes for specific industries; \(4\e moment we have evaluated only the data for the use of the information system, which regards customers portfolios \(cf. section 3.2\ the future we will compare the influences the use of different information systems on the three dimensions of process performance 5. Conclusion  Our key finding is the positive impact of process standardization on process efficiency and process quality. The effect unfolds both directly and indirectly through the mediating effect of control. Moreover our data revealed an unexpected relationship between process standardization, IT intensity and time These findings indicate that research into process standardization and performance should consider the process type, as we believe that the customer orientation of the advisory process is an important explanation for the results discussed here. Therefore, a comparison between customer-oriented processes and non-customer-oriented processes would most likely offer further insights into which exact attributes should be used for distinguishing between process types in future studies about standardization and performance Investigating the relationship between process standardization and IT intensity shows that there is both a strong interaction ef fect regarding positively affecting process performance, and also quite strong correlations between the constructs themselves Therefore, we claim that process standardization is an important complementary facet in the IT business value debate which has shown lasting recent years that complementary organizational resources and routines have to be considered in order to explain whether and how IT investment leads to higher process and firm performance  Based on our results, we can draw the following managerial implications. Managers should carefully evaluate the role of time in sales processes with respect to a possible trade-off between quality and efficiency. If managers are aware that customer satisfaction is a key success factor for their sales processes they should not try to decrease the time of the process in order to increase efficiency while sacrificing quality. Therefore, managers have to look carefully at the type of the processes before standardizing them in order to consciously optimize the three dimensions of process performance to keep customer satisfaction at a high level where necessary in the long term. As standardization often goes hand in hand with high IT intensity, as our data indicates, managers should give special attention to highly flexible workflow management systems in order to allow the customization of the advisory interview with respect to the specific customer needs while it is being performed     Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8

The distance of the reflected beam from the center of the aperture is then used to calculate I  which varies from about -0.8\260 to +0.8\260 in the experiment Figures 24-28 show the change r I    found by taking the difference of the center of each spectral image and subtracting from its location when I and compared the modeled values over the same range of I Figure 23 illustrates that there is some amount of random error in these measurements, but overa ll the data is grouped around r 0 pixel difference between the measured and modeled values.  The 404.7nm source shows the most variation  Figure 23 \226 The difference in pixel displacement at the detector array between measurements from modeled and collected data as a function of I     Figure 24 \226 Measured and modeled r   p  for the 404.7nm spectral line   Figure 25 \226 Measured and modeled r   p  for the 435.8nm spectral line   Figure 26 \226 Measured and modeled r   p or the 546nm spectral line   Figure 27 \226 Measured and modeled r   p  for the 577.5nm spectral line   Figure 28 \226 Measured and modeled r   p  for the 635nm spectral line   Given that the model is able to predict the displacement of energy as a result of an error in p   due to incident angle data was collected similar to that with the tilted camera to examine the effect system atic error due to unknown I  caused by a misaligned prism Here, the prism was angled in the mount in two directions to create the angles x and y  between the prism face and the normal to the optical axis as shown in Fig. 10.  The mo unt itself was tilted in two directions to create the misalignment angles x and y as shown in Fig. 12.  The magnitudes of these angles were measured by a laser as described above.  The aperture was placed such that each mm of separation at the aperture equates to 0.25\260 of angle at th e prism.  Misalignment in the instrument was used that gave values x  0.5\260 y  0.5\260 x 0.75\260 and y  0.5\260 with the instrument design again limiting the amount of error that could be imparted  The r   p  expression from Equation 17 will be compared to see how the displacement of each of the 5 wavelengths as a function of rotation angle varies given the different I  due to misalignment as the prism rotates.

  14 error for angles and is +/-0.2\260 and is incorporated into the model prediction.  Results are shown in Figures 24-29  Here, the measured data match the overall trends of the model very well, with some slight offset of about 2 pixels in each of the r   p  comparisons.  This would lead to the assumption that the estimate of x is not accurate, but is likely not the case since the mean of the model is too high in the 404nm data, and too low in the 435nm data.  This indicates that there are other errors being observed, as again it is nearly impossible to lim it the measurement to error in the intended so urce.  Also, note the decrease in impact the rotation error has as wavelength increases.  This is due to the lowered bearing P has on p as shown in the previous section.  However, the error magnitudes are a ratio of the distance from the undeviated wavelength, and in this data set are large due the large fractional error of and   4  R ESULTS  The systematic errors in a CTI instrument affect the spectral and spatial resolutions and locations in the reconstructed hyperspectral data cube in similar ways that these errors would affect the results of a traditional prism spectrograph This would be expected since the 3-D data is constructed from 2-D projection data.  The CTI becomes much more sensitive to error dependent on how the error kernel in the reconstruction behaves as a function of the prism rotation angle p and degree of freedom not in a fixed element dispersion system.  Four type s of systematic error were examined in this study; those due to tilt in the detector array  between the det ector array and the lens L 3  d   error in knowledge of the angular prism dispersion p    and error in estimation of the prism rotation angle p   s that can be inse rted into the error kernel functions were developed for each to model the effects For reasonably large array tilts of up to 3\260 and error in distance of up to 2mm, only a slightly noticeable shift of less than a pixel in spatial location was observed, mostly dependent on the tilt angle.  A more substantial spectral peak shift resulted which was due to error in distance, with a 7nm shift seen at the longer wavelengths at d  2mm.  The spatial and spectral resolu tions remained virtually unchanged, indicating that an accurate construction occurs in a shifted location The dispersion angle can be in error due to faulty estimation of prism performance.  This w ill cause an apparent shift of spectral peaks as shown in Figu re 8.  A more complicated  is the result of its dependence on the incident angle to the prism face I This is caused by mi salignment of the prism in the mount, or misalignment of the mount itself.  Mount misalignment is similar to cons tant error in estimation of p   with a shift in spectral p eaks observed.  For the AFIT CTI, this shift is only a few nm per 1\260 of misalignment Mount misalignment produces a more complex error kernel as shift and loss of resolutio n occur for relatively smaller angular errors.  More impor tantly, the spectral peaks become split into two peaks for errors of total misalignment in both the x and y directions of 1\260.  The spectral resolution may be recovered if the entire spatial area of the image is integrated.  However, simila r to splitting of peaks, the spatial distribution is a donut shape in the bin of emission  Finally, the error in projection angle p was examined though in a more obligatory fa shion since it is a relative error \(i.e. not a systematic erro r necessarily, but an error in choice of the reference coordinate system\.  There is no shifting of spectral peaks or lo ss of spectral resolution however there is a circular displacement of the spatial image again causing donut shap es for large enough   Most importantly, the error mode l was verified by collecting measured data from the AFIT CTI instrument with systematic error intentionally created in the instrument to assess the effect.  While in some cases it was apparent that sources of error other than those being investigated were influencing the results, the data did match the model for the situations where th e studied error effect was dominant usually at higher angular dispersi on, or spectral resolution Further investigation of some error may be necessary, as our CTI system design could only support a certain degree of component alteration to assess er ror.  In some cases, due to sampling of the detector array w ith respect to the size of the PSF of the system, slight changes in performance caused by error could not be resolved  4  C ONCLUSIONS  The purpose of this study wa s to assess the effect of systematic error on the reconstr ucted data sets collected by a rotating prism CTI instrument While the results are specific to the AFIT CTI desi gn, it is intended that the relative magnitude of each error and result on the reconstructed data will apply to any set of data given the general nature of the equations describing the reconstruction and error kernel that is con volved with each spectral bin  The consequence of each systematic error was quantified by the shift in spectral and/or spatial location, and degradation of spectral and/or spatial reso lution.  Table 2 summarizes the contribution of each analy zed error to these quantities   Table 2 \226The effect of systematic error.  An \223x\224 indicates an effect exists, a \223-\223 indicates no effect is observed   


  15 The model of the system allows for a quick assessment of the error, and provides a more illustrative demonstration of the prism misalignment error an d how each spectral peak is affected differently.  Figure 29 shows how the spectral peak changes as the prism mount alignment is increased in both the x and y directions for the 400nm and the 450nm spectral peaks   Figure 29 \226 The 400nm and 450nm peak shapes with varying misalignment of the prism mount   Similarly, Figure 30 represents the situation where the prism mount misalignment is constant at x  y 0.5\260 but the misalignment of the prism in the mount is changing so that a constant shape is produced, but shifted as x increases   Figure 30\226 Shifting of the 400nm spectral peak as x  increases.  The shape remains the same as the misalignment of the mount is constant   Though presented independently, the obvious contribution of the errors of the system are cumulative and must be considered in total.  Given th e great number of variations possible, this was not attempted here, but can be done based on the mathematics  This study is intended to explore the effect of systematic error for the purpose of examining sensitivity of performance when designing th e instrument.  In practice the reconstruction of collected data is done using after calibration of the instrument to directly measure r  p   without regard for the sources of error.  While this measurement can be a diagnostic of the instrument, the fact that it is well known is enough to perform acceptable reconstructions.  If instrume nt components are accessible the diagnostics be used to correct for second order error created in the instrument.  For example, errors in distance to the focal plane or tilt also result in a defocus error which cannot be easily recovered in the reconstruction algorithm R EFERENCES  1  C G r o s s, G  P.

South Korean versus American market  In terms of the effect of WOM, we find no discernable difference in the motion picture markets of South Korea and the United States. Volume of WOM is positively correlated to the following week?s revenue in both markets, and valence of WOM is not significant The effect of critical reviews, however, did not concur While the literature on the American market data reports that positive critical reviews are positively related to box office revenue[21, 34], the results on the Korean market was different. There could be several reasons for this. First, South Korea and the United States have different sources for critical reviews, and the sources may have different impacts on moviegoers Second, the characteristics of critics might be different i.e., Korean critics may prefer movies that are considered less commercial or artistic than American critics  5. Conclusion  WOM and critical reviews both are important attributes that influence box office revenue in the motion picture industry. In this study, six hypotheses related to this issue were set up and tested. Data was collected on the motion picture industry of South Korea by using several websites that provide content and statistical data about movies. Finally, data on 118 movies was collected and the movies were categorized into two groups based on the distributors of the movies If the distributor of a movie was one of the major distributors in South Korea, that movie was categorized into mainstream movies, and if not then the movie was categorized into non-mainstream movies. As expected mainstream movies had much higher box office revenue and volume of WOM than non-mainstream Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews 


movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews however, there was no big difference between mainstream and non-mainstream movies. WOM and critical reviews were usually positive H1 and H2 tested the relationship between WOM and weekly box office revenue, and the results supported the hypotheses. The volume of WOM was positively related to weekly box office revenue, while the valence of WOM had no significant effect. H3 H4a, and H4b tested the impact of critical reviews, and the results also supported the hypotheses except H4b The volume and valence of critical reviews had no consistent significances to weekly box office revenue H3 H4b. Table 7 showed that the number of critical reviews was statistically significant to aggregate box office revenue \(H4a for the attitude of critical reviews \(H4b the result more detail, an additional test was performed using only those factors related to critical reviews as independent variables. The result of the additional test supported H4, but the signs were reversed, i.e. positive critical reviews had minus signs, and negative critical reviews had plus signs. This reversed signs imply that the preference of critical reviewers is very similar to that of normal moviegoers. H5s and H6s tested the different effects of WOM and critical reviews on mainstream and non-mainstream movies. The result failed to determine that WOM give different impact on mainstream and non-mainstream movies, so H5a and H5b were rejected. H6, however, was supported, i.e the effects of critical reviews were different for mainstream and non-mainstream movies. There were no significant relationships between critical reviews and aggregate box office revenue in mainstream movies. For non-mainstream movies, however, the volume of critical reviews and the percentage of negative critical reviews were significant. Nonmainstream movies have fewer sources from which consumers can get information, and this might explain the results The above findings lead to several managerial implications. First, producers and distributors of movies could forecast weekly box office revenue by looking at previous weeks? volume of WOM. It does not matter what attitude people have when they spread WOM, the important factor is its volume. Therefore producers and distributors need to develop an appropriate strategy to manage WOM for their movies For example, the terms related to WOM marketing such as buzz and viral marketing are easily found Second, for the distributors who usually distribute less commercial and more artistic movies, and consequently have a smaller market compared to the major distributors, critical reviews can impact their movies box office revenues in a significant way. There are usually fewer sources for information for nonmainstream movies than mainstream movies, and so small efforts could leverage the outcomes. Finally, for those who are dealing with mainstream movies, the finding that the valence of WOM and critical reviews do not have significant relationship with box office revenue can have certain implications. Particularly, the attitude of critical reviews showed reversed effects Therefore, they may need to concentrate on other features rather than attitude of moviegoers or critical reviews, such as encouraging moviegoers to spread WOM This study contributes to the understanding of the motion picture industry, especially the relationship between box office revenue and WOM including critical reviews. There are existing studies that already 


critical reviews. There are existing studies that already dealt with similar issues, but this study has some differentiated features compare to prior studies. First the data used in this study was collected from South Korea, while most of the relevant studies usually focus on the North American market. This helps to provide the opportunity to understand the international market especially the Asian market, even though South Korea is a small part of it in terms of the motion picture industry. Second, movies were categorized to two groups, i.e. mainstream and non-mainstream and this study attempted to determine how WOM impacts these categories differently by testing several hypotheses In this study, there are also several limitations that could be dealt with in future research. First, using box office revenue as a dependent variable is more meaningful for distributers rather than producers. Due to there is close correlation between box office revenue and number of screens, one of producers? main concerns is how many screens their movies can be played on. Moreover, DVD sales are also important measurement for success of movies these days, and so it also could be a dependent variable. Therefore, it could be possible to give more fruitful managerial implications to various players in the motion picture industry by taking some other dependent variables Second, in this study, movies were categorized simply as mainstream and non-mainstream movies, but there could be further studies with diverse techniques of movie categorizations. For example, it would be possible to study the varying influence of WOM or critical reviews on different genres or movie budgets Third, an interesting finding of this study is that positive critical reviews could have negative relationship with box office revenue while negative critical reviews could have positive relationship. This study tried to provide a reasonable discussion on the issue, but more studies could be elaborate on it  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 References  1] Dellarocas, C., The Digitization of Word of Mouth Promise and Challenges of Online Feedback Mechanisms Management Science, 2003. 49\(10 2] Bone, P.F., Word-of-mouth effects on short-term and long-term product judgments.
