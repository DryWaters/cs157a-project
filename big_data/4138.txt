different computers to constitute a big computing system to execute some large tasks. The core technology of cloud computing is task scheduling, but the task scheduling problem of cloud computing is NP-hard, and it is very difficult to attain an optimal solution due to the isomerism and complexity of cloud resources. When the cloud resources are requested for by a big number of tasks, an efficient task scheduling algorithm is especially important. The characteristics of cloud computing resources such as heterogeneous, dynamic and self-governing make the task scheduling for grid computing to be extraordinary complex. The robustness and self-adaptability of ant colony optimization \(ACO\ just match the 
characteristics of cloud computing, which makes the ant colony optimization to have a good effect on the task scheduling for cloud computing Ant colony optimization \(ACO\[1 a p r o b a b i listi c  technique for solving computational problems. ACO has been proved to perform well in combinational optimization and other complex problems. Xu Zhihong and Sun Jizhou h a ve used ACO in grid computing task scheduling, but it doesnêt get a good performance since there are still some problems in pheromone intensity update. In that paper, when a task is assigned to a resource, the pheromone intensity of the selected resource will be increased, which will make more tasks select 
the resource and  lead to load imbalance. Moreover, it doesnêt consider scheduling period. If there are too many tasks to assign, the total tasks size assigned onto each resource will be increased, which will make the performance of the algorithm in both makespan and load balance be reduced In order to let ACO get a better performance, a period ACO_based scheduling algorithm \(PACO\ has been proposed in this paper which improves the update of the pheromone intensity and proposes the scheduling period strategy The rest of paper is organized as follow: section 2 is some related work in cloud computing and grid computing. Section 3 
proposes PACO algorithm.Section 4 elaborates the experiments and evaluation. Section 5 draws the conclusion and discussion about the future work II 
 
R ELATED W ORK  There are many researches on task scheduling algorithm in cloud computing or grid computing which is similar with cloud computing in task scheduling technology Min-Min algorithm ssi gne d  a t a sk t o t h e ear l i e s t  available and the fastest processor. Max-Min algorithm ha s  a contrary idea with the Min-Min algorithm. It always assigns the task with maximum expected completion time to 
corresponding resource. He

But both Min-Min algorithm and Max-Min algorithm donêt take the load factors into consideration A load-adaptive cloud resource scheduling model based on ant colony algorithm has been proposed in [6  B y  re alti m e  monitoring virtual machine of performance parameters, once judging overload, the algorithm schedules fast cloud resources using ant colony algorithm to bear some load on the load-free

A stochastic model of load balancing and scheduling has been proposed in  T h e y c o nsi de r  a st oc ha sti c m o de l o f a c l o u d computing cluster, where jobs arrive according to a stochastic process and request virtual machines.

Another two DAG based algorithm is the Heterogeneous Earliest Finish Time algorithm \(HEFT\ [9 a nd t h e Clust e r  E a r l i e st Finish  T i m e  Duplication algorithm \(CFTD  H E F T a l gor i t hm  a l w a ys  selects the task with the highest upward rank at each step and then the selected task is assigned to a host that can minimize its earliest finish time. The CFTD algorithm is based on HEFT and it attempts to insert suitable immediate parent nodes of the current selected node in order to reduce its waiting time on the processor. But, the DAG based algorithm in [8  9 an d  1 0   are all for dependent tasks Based on ACO, this paper has proposed an independent tasks scheduling algorithm PACO. PACO takes the scheduling period into consideration for the first time. And the experiments results show that PACO has a good performance in makespan and load balance III In general, the ant colony optimization \(ACO\s given to solve Travel Salesman Problem \(TSP\[11  In  TS P, th e in it ial  pheromone intensity on every path is same as each other namely every node has the same probability to be passed by at first, and then the pheromone intensity would be adjusted In cloud computing, the different resources have different capacity to executing the tasks, which leads to the difference of the initial pheromone intensity on each resource. And the assignment of tasks should be adjusted according to the realtime capacity of resources and the change of load. Thus it is necessary to make some change to the ant colony algorithm to get better performance in cloud computing task scheduling When new resource is added to the cloud cluster, the number of its processers would be provided, as well as the capacity of each processer and the bandwidth of the resource the type of each processer, the memory size and so on. The innate pheromone intensity of resource is initialized according to \(1 1   1 At the beginning of the algorithm, the real-time pheromone intensity  is initialized according to the innate pheromone intensity of each resource  0 2 Every ant takes tasks and chooses resources to assign the tasks. The ant chooses a resource for a task with the maximum probability according to \(3      0 3 Where  is the real-time pheromone intensity of resource at time  is the innate performance quantity of the resource  and are variable parameters and they can be adjusted depend on circumstances represents the importance degree of the real-time pheromone intensity, while represents the importance degree of the innate pheromone intensity When a resource is selected, the pheromone intensity of it will be updated according to \(4   4 is the length of the task assigned onto resource at time  and  s also a variable parameter After all tasks are be assigned, compute the total execution time and check whether it is the shortest execution time in current. If so, the modification of the real-time pheromone intensity according to \(4\ill be canceled, and then update the real-time pheromone intensity according to \(5  1   5 is the total length of all the tasks assigned to resource this time; and 0 1\ an another variable parameter  represents pheromone residue factor 1    avoids the pheromone accumulated too big, it simulates the memory of animals, which means that with the new information is stored in the brain, the old information is gradually forgotten is to avoid the pheromone accumulated too fast Line 9 in Fig.1 is the period strategy we proposed for the first time. During the running of the first ant in first loop, if the pheromone intensity of a resource is reduced to the minimum value we set up, the resource will be shut down and doesnêt accept tasks any more; if all the resources are shut down record the total number of the tasks as and is the number of the tasks in this scheduling period. The tasks which are not be assigned will be assigned in next scheduling period The PACO algorithm is shown in Fig. 1 Fig. 1

Line 7 update the pheromone intensity according to \(4\ and line 13 update the pheromone intensity by \(5 In PACO, when a task is assigned onto a resource, the pheromone intensity of the selected resource will be reduced That will lower the chance that other tasks select the resource and promote the load balance. When a loop ends, the pheromone intensity of the resources will be increased if the scheduling scheme is the best scheme by far, which let the ant select the better scheme and accelerate convergence velocity of the algorithm If there are too many tasks to assign, a resource will accept many tasks which will overtop its processing capacity. And if all the resourcesê pheromone intensity reduced to the minimum value, all the tasks that are not assigned will select the resource which has the largest innate pheromone intensity according to 3\, and this will lead to load balance and increase the execution time. Considering this problem, we proposed a period strategy. In the strategy, if the tasks are too many, they will be assigned in different period IV E XPERIMENTS AND E VALUATION  We use CloudSim [12 w h ich is a sim u latio n  to o l  o f cl o u d  computing to simulate the PACO algorithm. And in order to know whether it can work well or not, at the same time we simulate the Min-Min algorithm to compare with PACO Firstly, we use CloudSim to create 10 resources randomly Their properties are shown in the following Table I TABLE I During the experiments, the execution time of one scheduling scheme formed by an ant is needed to predict. The prediction execution time of each resource is given by \(6        6 Where is the set of the tasks assigned onto resource   is the size that needs to execute for task   he bandwidth of resource   is the transmission size of task and  is the capacity of resource Thus     means the predicted  time of the task executed on resource  and     means the time that task transfer to resource So the total prediction execution time of this scheduling scheme is as \(7 max   7 For the settings of the four variable parameters and  in ant colony algorithm, we have conducted experiments and analysis. And the results show that, when the performance and convergence velocity of the algorithm is better. For the loop times N-max, we find that, in general, the algorithm has already converged before 15 times loop, so we set the N-max is 15 As one of the classic task scheduling algorithms, Min-Min algorithmês realization is simple, complexity is low and the scheduling performance is very good. The procedure of MinMin algorithm is shown in Fig. 2. Therefore, many studies in task scheduling algorithm take Min-Min algorithm as a reference object to measure the performance of a new algorithm. We conduct multiple experiments to compare the two algorithms. The results are shown in Fig. 3, Fig. 4. In Fig 3, the horizontal axis represents the total size of all the tasks assigned in one experiment, and vertical axis represents makespan. In Fig .4, the horizontal axis represents the resource id, and vertical axis represents the ratio of the total size of tasks assigned onto a resource in all experiments to the capacity of the corresponding resource  Fig. 2

For example, the executive capability of Resource 8 is larger than Resource 7, and Resource 7 is larger than Resource 10 To simulate the randomness of the cloud tasks, we create the tasks randomly related to the properties, such as the size of the task, the length of the input and output and so on The procedure Min-Min algorithm

For load balance, we take the processing capacity of each resource into consideration, not only think about the total tasks size of each resource The results show that, PACO is better than Min-Min algorithm both in makespan and load balance of the resources In Fig. 3, although the total size of the tasks of PACO is large than that of Min-Min algorithm, the makespan of PACO is still much smaller than Min-Min algorithm. In Fig. 4, the load of PACO is obviously more balanced than Min-Min algorithm We consider the Standard Deviation\lue of each algorithm in Fig. 4. As we know is defined by \(8 2 1 1  8 Where is the values of vertical axis in Fig. 4 and N is the total number of Then, we can calculate the values according to \(8  0.10235  0.51384 We can see that is almost four times bigger than and we can find that the fluctuation of PACO curve is much smaller than the fluctuation of Min-Min curve. That is to say that the load of PACO is much more balanced than the load of Min-Min algorithm This is because Min-Min algorithm takes insufficient account of the balance of innate processing capacity and dynamic performance of resources. Min-Min algorithm only computes the ECT matrix, and makes the resource with small capacity accept tasks overtopping its capacity. However PACO takes good consideration for both innate processing capacity and dynamic performance of resources. We can see it in line 5 and line 8 in Fig. 1. Line 5 computes  according to both innate processing capacity and dynamic perform of the resources, and when the load is two heavy, line 8 will work  Fig. 3 C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE W ORK  A period ACO_based scheduling algorithm \(PACO\ in cloud computing tasks scheduling is proposed in this paper According to the first proposed scheduling period strategy and the improvement of the update strategy of pheromone intensity the PACO algorithm works very well. The simulation experiments results demonstrate that PACO performs better than Min-Min algorithm in both makespan and load balance In this paper, we confirm that PACO can acquire good performance in cloud computing tasks scheduling. However there are still some details we should consider more.  In the future, we will consider more about the arguments of the PACO and research the dynamically adjusting strategy. And then, we will research the strategy how to combine independent tasks algorithm and dependent ta sks algorithm such as we proposed in [8   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work is supported in part by Natural Science Foundation of China under grant No. 61103233, 61202442 61202443, the Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities \(DUT12JR08 R EFERENCES  1

number, and he residual energy of GTFT and NOGTFT is much more average than that of MCFT. From figure 10, we can know that the average consumption of MCFT turn out to be much higher than that of GTFT and NOGTFT. It should be noted than MCFT only guarantee the complete time of tasks and does not care about the energy consumption or the residual energy of nodes, which leads to more tasks being allocated to the nodes with higher executing ability. On the contrary, GTFT and NOGTFT not only focus on the complete time of tasks, but also consider the energy consumption of tasks and the residual energy of each node which leads to more tasks being allocated on the nodes which have more energy. Due to the restriction of energy in WSN, the consumption of energy and the balance of network energy are the vital factors to impact the networkês lifecycle we come to the conclusion that GTFT and NOGTFT will perform better than MCFT in the lifecycle of WSN  Figure 10 C ONCLUSION  This paper presents an efficient fault-tolerant scheduling algorithm that schedules independent tasks in a heterogeneous WSN. We discuss the problem of primary copies allocation dealing with energy efficiency, minimizing tasks execution time, load balancing in WSNs with the help of concepts from game theory. Then striving to delay the start time of backup copies, we employ the backup copy overlapping technology within timing constraints. The illustration and experimental results indicate that the algorithm is effective. In the future, we will structure a more complex game theory model, and extend our fault-tolerant model to reduce unnecessary redundancy of the overlap A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 61103175, the Key Project of Chinese Ministry of Education under Grant No.212086, the Technology Innovation Platform Project of Fujian Province under Grant No.2009J1007, the Key projects of Fujian Provincial Department of Education Science and Technology under Grant No.JA11011, the Colleges and Universities in Fujian Province Outstanding Young Talent Projects under Grant No.JA12016. the Program for New Century Excellent Talents in Fujian Province University R EFERENCES  1

are given in Figure 8\(b Figures 9\(b and 10\(b again details the execution times of the different parts in the order in which they were executed For  the Rout script executed in only of the total time taken to execute the corresponding PigLatin script while for the Rout script executed within only of the time taken to execute the matching PigLatin script In the wake of thunderstorm Sandy ravaging New York the third script explores W EATHER D ATA for determining historical weather anomalies In our experiment the script determined all days where both the temperature and wind speed were extreme Experiments were executed for both the full GB of data   GB in and GB in  and a smaller dataset of size GB   GB in and GB in  W EATHER D ATA are distributed based on the year of the records Records from years to were in and the rest were in  Execution times are given in the Figure 8\(c Figures 9\(c and 10\(c again show the execution times for the different parts of the execution in the order in which they occurred As in the previous benchmark the dataîow graph of the weather explorer script consisted of a single MapReduce job WeatherMR for both Rout and PigLatin But in our script we used the operator to join temperature and wind speed inputs instead of the operator Because of this for Rout the scripts could be executed while keeping data GD the distribution of the input data based on the year of its recording allowed to be applied For the Rout script executed within only of the time taken to execute the corresponding PigLatin script while for the Rout script executed within of the time of the corresponding PigLatin script VI R ELATED W ORK This section describes work related to Rout and Rrun Apache Cascading is another open-source dataîo w engine Cascading consists of a data processing API integration API process planer and process scheduler Like Pig Cascading operates on top of Hadoop in a single datacenter FlumeJava is a statically typed data processing language proposed by Google It is implemented as a Java library A dataîow graph making use of MapReduce jobs for parallelization is generated from a FlumeJava program PQL is another extension of Java recently proposed by Reichenbach et al PQL is a logic-based declarati v e language which facilitates the expression of parallel elements of a computing task with regular Java code being used to deal with the sequential portions The approach supports programmer productivity and allows for aggressive optimizations PQL does not address geo-\ution PLINQ is an e xtension of LINQ 23 for parallel querying of data similar to PQL PLINQ enjoys explicit syntactic support inside NET In contrast to PQL PLINQ is inspired by SQL-style relational queries select statements and is not fully declarative DryadLINQ is an implementation of LINQ for the e x ecution engine None of these languages or their runtime environments currently support setups beyond a single datacenter/cluster Given that all the above-mentioned languages and models revolve around data structures and collections e.g sets maps along with arrays in PQL they are amenable to augmentation with GD data structures Many efforts focus on optimizing dataîow execution instead of dealing with geo-\ution This includes countless optimizations for the MapReduce framework targeting single clusters These are complementary to our work Parcae is a no v el parallel e x ecution en vironment optimized for multiexecutions The solution includes a compiler that creates exible parallel programs a monitor which determines and analyzes resource availability and system performance and an executor which may replace the executing tasks with ones that are better suited for the operating environment Airavat aims at secure analysis of third-party datasets with MapReduce providing strong privacy guarantees in the face of untrusted tasks When combined with a secure inter-datacenter data transfer mechanism solutions such as Airavat can be seamlessly integrated to Rrun to improve the security guarantees of the distributed execution Most commercial databases such as Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server are designed to handle highly structured data that is available in a single location Many of these databases support multi-region deployments but for high availability and/or fault tolerance Thus they are unsuited for handling GD data Amazon RDS is a cloud-based database solution The back-end of RDS is a relational database deployed in Amazon datacenters RDS supports multi\(availability zone deployments But this is not truly GD since Amazon availability zones are located within a single datacenter Volley is a system for automatically geo-distrib uting data based on the needs of an application presupposing knowledge on the placement of its data client access patterns and locations Based on this information data will be dynamically migrated between datacenters to optimize access times Services like Volley complement a GD dataîow engine but do not replace it Walter is a k e y-v alue storage system that can hold massive amounts of GD data Walter allows transactions and replication of data across

feature named allows Walter to provide strong guarantees while performing replication asynchronously In Walter nodes within a datacenter observe transactions on a consistent snapshot with global ordering while nodes across sites only have to follow causal ordering COPS is another k e y-v alue storage system for GD data COPS is highly scalable and can enforce causal dependencies The main strategy of COPS consists in enforcing causal dependencies between keys before writes are exposed VII C ONCLUSIONS The cloud computing paradigm provides a partial response to data challenges Clouds are however implemented by concrete datacenters whose geographical location matter and no single datacenter can host all the data in the world reliably and efìciently The current toolchain has to mature by considering real-life constraints such as geographical distribution or administrative domains This paper has presented Rout a data processing language capable of expressing programs involving datasets from multiple datacenters including individual datasets that are partitioned across datacenters As illustrated by our empirical evaluation even on GD data processing programs compiled to few MapReduce stages Rout is able to reduce the execution time down to half compared to a straightforward schedule which consolidates all data rst At the same time Rout exposes only little geo-distribution to programmers We are currently exploring further copy heuristics and datacenter selection policies than those presented in Section IV the integration of access control for multi-domain setups and the integration our GD model with other dataîow languages R EFERENCES  Y  Y u M Isard D Fetterly  M Budiu U Erlingsson P  K Gunda and J Currey DryadLINQ A System for Generalpurpose Distributed Data-parallel Computing Using a Highlevel Language in
