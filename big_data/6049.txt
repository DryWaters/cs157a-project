R. China  AbstractFrequent pattern mining and utility mining have been studied popularly. However, frequent pattern mining only mines frequent patterns without considering the different utility values of individual items and utility mining focuses on identifying the patterns with high utilities but no guarantee their frequencies. In this paper, we introduce a utility frequent pattern mining model based on a share strategy to find the combination of items with high frequencies and utilities. This model first find all patterns with a given minimum support threshold. In this step, a share strategy gives a way to share most of the results from the previous mining process instead of separating them distinctively thereby dramatically reducing the cost of computation. And then all patterns that do not satisfy a user specified utility are pruned The performance study shows that the share strategy is efficient for utility frequent patterns mining Keywords-data mining; association rules; utility frequent patterns; frequent pattern mining; utility mining I.  INTRODUCTION Association rules mining \(ARM important data mining strategies, was firstly introduced by [1 So far, many algorithms for mining association rules have been presented in the literature. The main goal of ARM is to find interesting association or correlation relationships among a set of items. It first finds all the patterns whose co-occurrence frequency are beyond a minimum support threshold, and then generates rules from the frequent patterns based on a minimum confidence threshold. Compared to the first problem, the solution for the second one is rather straightforward [2 Finding correlations among a set of items is very useful but frequent patterns identified by ARM may only contribute a small portion of the overall profit, because traditional ARM model treat all the items in the database equally by only considering if an item is present in a transaction or not [3 


In order to overcome the limitation of AMR, a utility mining model was defined. The goal of utility mining is to identify high utility patterns which drive a large portion of the total utility [4]. Utility is a measure of how useful an itemset i. e. pattern transaction utility and external utility. The local transaction utility of an item is defined according to the information stored in a transaction, like the quantity of the item sold in the transaction. The external utility of an item is based on information from resources besides transactions, like a profit table. Traditional ARM model assumes that the utility of each item is always 1 and the sales quantity is either 0 or 1, thus it is only a special case of utility mining, where the utility or the sales quantity of each item could be any number [5 Although utility mining is important in a great amount of applications, it does not indicate how often such patterns appear in the database. There may be some high utility patterns but only appear in few transactions. Such patterns may not be contributed to decision because of their infrequencies The main contributions of this paper are as follow. Based on a share strategy, we present a utility frequent pattern mining \(UFPM high frequencies and utilities. This model first discovers all patterns with a given minimum support threshold. In this step a share strategy gives a way to share most of the results from the previous mining process instead of separating them distinctively, thereby dramatically reducing the cost of computation. And then all patterns that do not satisfy a user specified utility threshold are pruned. We propose an algorithm, called Share Utility Frequent Pattern Mining Share-UFPM for short utility frequent patterns. The performance study shows that the share strategy is efficient for mining utility frequent patterns The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II states the definitions and reviews the related work. Section III proposes the UFPM model and algorithms. Section IV presents the performance study. Finally, Section V lists the conclusion and the future work II. DEFINITIONS A. Frequent patterns mining 


Let I= {x1, x2  xm} be a set of items. An itemset X, also called a pattern, is a subset of I and is denoted by X ? I. A transaction TX = \(TID, X TID is its unique identifier. A transaction TX is said to contain TY if and only if Y ? X. Let D = {T1, T2 Tn} be a set of transactions. The ratios of the number of transactions in D that contain X and the total number of transactions is called the support of X. A pattern X is a frequent pattern, if and only if its support is larger than or equal to s, where s is a threshold called minimum support. The problem of frequent patterns mining is to find the complete set of frequent patterns in a given transaction database with respect to a certain support threshold s. According to many studies for mining frequent patterns from databases, the algorithms can be separated into two classes: candidate set generation and pattern growth. [6 B.  Utility mining The following are the definitions of a set of terms that lead to the formal definition of utility mining problem [7 I = {i1, i2 im} is a set of items D = {T1, T2 Tn} be a transaction database where each transaction Ti  D is a subset of I This work is partially supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities #QN0906 1429 o\(ip, Tq transaction Tq, represents the sales quantity of item ip in Tq s\(ip with item ip in the utility table. This value reflects the importance of an item, which is independent of transactions u\(ip, Tq measure of utility for item ip in Tq, is defined as o\(ip, Tq s\(ip u\(X, Tq  qp qp TXXi Tiu  Where X= {i1, i2 ik} is a k-itemset, ip?I, 1?p?k, 1?k m u\(X defined as 


 qq q TXDT TXu  The goal of utility mining is to discover all patterns itemsets threshold in a transaction database. It overcomes the shortcomings of traditional frequent patterns mining, which ignores the different utility values of items. A pattern X is a utility pattern if u\(X utility threshold, otherwise, it is not a utility pattern Since the utility mining was presented, there have been extensive studies on the improvements or extensions, as in [8 Example 1 Table 1 is a transaction database which is listed in 4]. The number in each transaction in Table 1\(a quantities of each item \(local transaction utility value of each item b Let X= {A, C}, u\(X X, T3 X, T8 u\(A, T3 u \(C, T3 u\(A, T8 C, T8 o\(A, T3 A C, T3 s\(C o\(A, T8 A C, T8 C 2*3+1*1 3*3 +25*1 set at 40, X is a utility pattern Utility mining is useful in many applications, but it does not consider how often such patterns appear. Because some utility frequent patterns only accidentally appear in few transactions, they should not be contributed to decision support TABLE I.

Utility frequent patterns mining The following are the definitions of utility frequent pattern mining problem T \(X X, Tq transactions that contain X and generate at least utility ? on X

Namely UFP = {X ?

A SHARE STRATEGY FOR UTILITY FREQUENT PATTERNS MINING A. Model description Theorem 1 For a given minimum utility threshold ? and a given minimum support threshold s, if a pattern X \(X?I utility frequent, then X must be frequent Proof Because X is utility frequent, Support\(X D  x, T s. T\(X X, Tq Tq ? D | X ? Tq }=T\(X i.e. the set of transactions that contain X X D T\(x Support\(X D  x, T s. Therefore, X is also frequent 


According to Theorem 1, the complete set of utility frequent patterns is a subset of all frequent patterns. So, we have a two-step model for utility frequent patterns mining. In the first step, Share-FPM algorithm is proposed to find all frequent patterns. In the second step, Share-UFPM scans the database once to check whether each frequent pattern is utility frequent TID Items sold A B C D E T1 0 0 18 0 1 T2 0 6 0 1 1 T3 2 0 1 0 1 T4 1 0 0 1 1 T5 0 0 4 0 2 T6 1 1 0 0 0 T7 0 10 0 1 1 T8 3 0 25 3 1 T9 1 1 0 0 0 T10 0 6 2 0 2 Item Utility A 3 B 10 C 1 D 6 E 5 1430 B. Share strategy for frequent patterns mining In this subsection, we first propose a new data structure Share-struct, which is derived but obviously different from FPtree. Then we developed an efficient algorithm, Share-FPM for mining all frequent patterns Definition 1 Share-struct is a structure defined below It consists of a FP-tree and Share-tables. For each node in the FP-tree of Share-struct, the link fields for parent and next are redundant, so they are removed to save space, and once the tree is built, it will never be changed during the whole mining process, making the FP-tree more compressed and stable. Each entry in a Share-table consists of four fields: item-name, localcount, new, and old, where item-name represents an item local-count records the local support of an item in a given prefix, new field links the nodes not considered in the tree, and 


old field points to the nodes traversed or a Share-table constructed Based on the definition mentioned above, we have the following Share-struct construction algorithm Algorithm 1 Share-struct-Construction Input:  a database DB, and a minimum support threshold s Output:  a Share-struct, S Method:Call Share-struct-Construction \(DB, s, S Procedure Share-struct-Construction \(DB, s, S L1 = {the set of all frequent items sort items in L1 in support descending order create a FP-tree, T call Initialize \(S?, T  The procedure Initialize is shown in the following Procedure Initialize \(S?, new, old for each child ci of new/old add ci to the relevant new field in S ci.local-count= ci.local-count + ci.count  Example 3 Table 2 shows the example transaction database which is borrowed from [9]. Let the minimum support threshold be 2 TABLE II.  A TRANSACTION DATABASE AS RUNNING EXAMPLE, DB  Because only the frequent items will play a role in the frequent pattern mining, it is necessary to scan the DB once to identify the set of frequent items \(L1 compactness, we order L1 in support descending order L1={f:4, c:4, a:3, b:3, m:3, p:3, l:2, o:2 DB for a second time to construct the FP-tree. The construction algorithm of a FP-tree is proposed in [10 Readers are referred to the cited paper for details. The FP-tree in a Share-struct is almost the same as the one in [10] except for each notes parent and next fields. They are redundant in Share-struct, so they are removed. Afterwards, we create the first Share-table S? according to L1.

Share-UFPM Algorithm According to our mining model description, each utility frequent pattern is also frequent. After Share-FPM algorithm finds all frequent patterns, the Share-UFPM algorithm scans the database once to check whether each frequent pattern candidate algorithm is as follow Algorithm 3 Share-UFPM Input:   S?, s Output:   UFP, utility frequent patterns in DB Method:  Call Share-UFPM\(S?, s

PERFORMANCE STUDY To evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithms, we have done extensive experiments on various kinds of datasets with different features. The experiments are based on a 2.4GMHz Pentium IV PC with 512MB main memory and 60 GB hard driver, running on Microsoft Windows 2000 Server. All the programs are written in Microsoft/Visual C++6.0 The measured performance is algorithms execution time on the datasets with different minimum support threshold. The execution time only includes the disk reading time \(scan datasets output frequent patterns speed of disk writing A. Datasets and characteristics We use real world and synthetic data for our performance study. The basic characteristics of datasets are listed in the following The real world dataset called Retail is achieved from a retailing company. Retail contains products from various categories. There are 16469 items and 88162 transactions in the dataset. Each transaction consists of the products purchased by a customer at a time point. Its average transaction size and average maximal potentially frequent patterns size are 10.3 and 3. The size of this dataset is 4M The synthetic data sets which were used for the experiments were achieved from the online FIMI repository See the RUL: http://fimi.cs.helsinki.fi/. The data sets are T10I4D100K and T40I10D100K. In T10I4D100K, the average record size and average maximal potentially frequent patterns 


size are 10 and 4. In T40I10D100K, they are 40 and 10. The numbers of transactions in both two dataset are set to 100K There are exponentially numerous frequent patterns when the support threshold goes down B. Experimental results In order to mine the utility frequent patterns, we randomly generate the count of each item between 1 and 6. In fact, most items are in the low profit range, we synthetically generate utility values of each item from 0.01 to 10.00, using a log normal distribution. For instance, Fig.2 shows the distribution of the utility values of items in T10I4D100K 1432 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 N um be r o f i te m s Utility value  Figure 2.  Utility value distribution in T10I4D100K For selecting appropriate utility thresholds, we use the average transaction utility value to constraint the utility threshold instead of randomly choosing it. For example, in Table 1, where the average transaction utility value is 40. If the utility threshold is equal to 25%, it represents that ? = 10 40  25% =10 We compare the performance of Share-FPM with BUUFM [5], an up to date algorithm for utility frequent patterns 


mining. Fig.3 through Fig.5 show the performance curves of two algorithms on three datasets respectively. We can see that the Share-UFPM algorithm outperforms BU-UFM on all datasets, and the performance gap becomes significant when the minimum support threshold drops low enough 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 Ti m e S ec on ds  Minimum support \(%0 Share-UFPM BU-UFM Utility threshold=5  Figure 3.

CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we introduce a utility frequent pattern mining model based on a share strategy to find the combination of items with high frequencies and utilities. This model first find all patterns with a given minimum support threshold. In this step, a share strategy gives a way to share most of the results from the previous mining process instead of separating them distinctively, thereby dramatically reducing the cost of computation. And then all patterns that do not satisfy a minimum utility threshold are pruned The extension of our technique, for maintenance of the already mined utility frequent patterns when updating databases, is an interesting topic for future research REFERENCES 1] R.

the time needed for execution exceeded 100000 seconds Thus, from this analysis we see that FPrep, which uses FCM clustering, clearly outperforms the CLARANS and CURE based methods on the basis of speed. The execution times for CLARANS and CURE mentioned in fig. 7 and Table II do not include the time required to create fuzzy sets, and calculate the membership value  for each numerical data point in every fuzzy set for the numerical attribute under consideration. These times also do not take into account the time required to transform crisp numerical attributes to fuzzy attributes, and derive the fuzzy dataset from the original crisp dataset The fuzzy partitions generated for each of the five numerical attributes for the USCensus1990raw dataset are shown in Table III. Coincidentally, generating three fuzzy partitions for each numerical attribute seemed a perfect fit In addition to the superior speeds achieved by FPrep, as illustrated in fig. 7 and Table II, Table III indicates the semantics and the quality of the fuzzy partitions generated by FPrep. Moreover, the number of frequent itemsets generated by a fuzzy ARM algorithm \(like fuzzy ARMOR and fuzzy Apriori minimum support threshold, is illustrated in fig. 8   Fig. 7. Algorithm, numerical attribute comparison based on speed \(log10 seconds   Fig. 8. Number of frequent itemsets for various minimum support values  B. Results from Second Dataset We have also applied FPrep on the FAM95 dataset http://www.stat.ucla.edu/data/fpp transactions. Of the 23 attributes in the dataset, we have used the first 18, of which six are quantitative and the rest are binary. For each of the six quantitative attributes, we have generated fuzzy partitions using FPrep. A thorough analysis with respect to execution times, has already been performed on the USCensus1990raw dataset \(which is manifolds bigger in size than the FAM95 dataset both on the basis of number of transactions and number of unique values for numerical 


attributes dataset has been done solely to provide further evidence of the quality and semantics of the fuzzy partitions generated by FPrep. The details of the same are in Table IV. In this case, the number of fuzzy partitions is different for different numerical attributes. Thus, the number and type of fuzzy partitions to be generated is totally dependent on the attribute under consideration. A graphical representation of the fuzzy partitions generated for the attribute Age has already been provided in fig. 5, and clearly shows the Gaussian nature of the fuzzy partitions. The nature and shapes of fuzzy partitions for the rest of the attributes are also similar. Last, the number of frequent itemsets generated for different minimum support values is illustrated in fig. 8  C. Analysis of Results With FPrep, we can analyze and zero in on the number and type of partitions required based on the semantics of the numerical attributes, which the methods detailed in [19 20] do not necessarily facilitate. Then, FPrep, backed by FCM clustering, takes care of the creating the fuzzy partitions, especially assigning membership values for each numerical data point in each fuzzy partition. In section 8.A we have already shown that FPrep is nearly 9 to 44 times faster than the CURE-based method, and 2672 to 13005 times faster than the CLARANS-based method. FPrep is not only much faster than other related methods, but also generates very high quality fuzzy partitions \(Table III and IV much user-intervention. We have created a standard way of representing any fuzzy dataset \(converted from any type of crisp dataset efficacy of the same is corroborated by the successful implementation of Fuzzy Apriori and Fuzzy ARMOR on the fuzzy dataset \(converted from crisp version of FAM95 dataset an initial implementation of Fuzzy ARMOR, are very encouraging. FPrep, when used in conjunction with these fuzzy ARM algorithms, generates a pretty good number of high-quality frequent itemsets \(fig. 8 frequent itemsets generated for a particular minimum support is same, irrespective of the fuzzy ARM algorithm 


used IX. CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have highlighted our methodology, called FPrep, for ARM in a fuzzy scenario. FPrep is meant for seamlessly and holistically transforming a crisp dataset into a fuzzy dataset such that it can drive a subsequent fuzzy ARM process. It does not rely on any non-fuzzy techniques and is thus more straightforward, fast, and consistent. It facilitates user-friendly automation of fuzzy dataset 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 Age - 91 Hours - 100 Income3 4949 Income2 13707 Income1 55089 Ti m e lo g1 0 se co nd s Numerical Attribute - Number of Unique Values FCM CURE CLARANS 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500

This methodology involves two distinct steps, namely creation of appropriate fuzzy partitions using fuzzy clustering and creation of fuzzy records, using these partitions, to get the fuzzy dataset from the original crisp dataset FPrep has been compared with other such techniques, and has been found to better on the basis of speed. We also illustrate its efficacy on the basis of quality of fuzzy partitions generated and the number of itemsets mined by a fuzzy ARM algorithm which is preceded by FPrep. This preprocessing technique provides us with a standard method of fuzzy data \(record that it is useful for any kind of fuzzy ARM algorithm irrespective of how the algorithm works. Furthermore, this pre-processing methodology has been adequately tested with two disparate fuzzy ARM algorithms, Fuzzy Apriori and Fuzzy ARMOR, and would also work fine with other fuzzy ARM algorithm REFERENCES 1] Zadeh, L.

the US census data set. The size of pilot sample is 2000, and all 50 rules are derived from this pilot sample. In this experiment the ?xed value x for the sample size is set to be 300. The attribute income is considered as a differential attribute, and the difference of income of husband and wife is studied in this experiment.

Dataset procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the US census data set. The results are also similar to the experiment results for association rule mining: there is a consistent trade off between the estimation variance and sampling cost by setting their weights. Our proposed methods have better performance than simple random sampling method 


We also evaluated the performance of our methods on the Yahoo! dataset. The size of pilot sampling is 2000, and the xed value x for the sample size is 200. The attribute price is considered as the target attribute. Figure 4 shows the performance of the 5 sampling procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the Yahoo! dataset. The results are very similar to those from the previous experiments VI. RELATED WORK We now compare our work with the existing work on sampling for association rule mining, sampling for database aggregation queries, and sampling for the deep web Sampling for Association Rule Mining: Sampling for frequent itemset mining and association rule mining has been studied by several researchers [23], [21], [11], [6]. Toivonen [23] proposed a random sampling method to identify the association rules which are then further veri?ed on the entire database. Progressive sampling [21], which is based on equivalence classes, involves determining the required sample size for association rule mining FAST [11], a two-phase sampling algorithm, has been proposed to select representative transactions, with the goal of reducing computation cost in association rule mining.A randomized counting algorithm [6] has been developed based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo method for counting the number of frequent itemsets Our work is different from these sampling methods, since we consider the problem of association rule mining on the deep web. Because the data records are hidden under limited query interfaces in these systems, sampling involves very distinct challenges Sampling for Aggregation Queries: Sampling algorithms have also been studied in the context of aggregation queries on large data bases [18], [1], [19], [25]. Approximate Pre-Aggregation APA  categorical data utilizing precomputed statistics about the dataset Wu et al. [25] proposed a Bayesian method for guessing the extreme values in a dataset based on the learned query shape pattern and characteristics from previous workloads More closely to our work, Afrati et al. [1] proposed an adaptive sampling algorithm for answering aggregation queries on hierarchical structures. They focused on adaptively adjusting the sample size assigned to each group based on the estimation error in each group. Joshi et al.[19] considered the problem of 


estimating the result of an aggregate query with a very low selectivity. A principled Bayesian framework was constructed to learn the information obtained from pilot sampling for allocating samples to strata Our methods are clearly distinct for these approaches. First strata are built dynamically in our algorithm and the relations between input and output attributes are learned for sampling on output attributes. Second, the estimation accuracy and sampling cost are optimized in our sample allocation method Hidden Web Sampling: There is recent research work [3 13], [15] on sampling from deep web, which is hidden under simple interfaces. Dasgupta et al.[13], [15] proposed HDSampler a random walk scheme over the query space provided by the interface, to select a simple random sample from hidden database Bar-Yossef et al.[3] proposed algorithms for sampling suggestions using the public suggestion interface. Our algorithm is different from their work, since our goal is sampling in the context of particular data mining tasks. We focus on achieving high accuracy with a low sampling cost for a speci?c task, instead of simple random sampling VII. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have proposed strati?cation based sampling methods for data mining on the deep web, particularly considering association rule mining and differential rule mining Components of our approach include: 1 the relation between input attributes and output attributes of the deep web data source, 2 maximally reduce an integrated cost metric that combines estimation variance and sampling cost, and 3 allocation method that takes into account both the estimation error and the sampling costs Our experiments show that compared with simple random sampling, our methods have higher sampling accuracy and lower sampling cost. Moreover, our approach allows user to reduce sampling costs by trading-off a fraction of estimation error 332 6DPSOLQJ9DULDQFH
