During EDL, the spacecraft’s orientation is \ndetermined by its guidance and mechanical subsystems to \nensure that the vehicle land safely at its destination.  Although \norientation to maximize telecom performance is not possible, \nantennas are especially designed and mounted to provide the nbest possible line of sight to Earth and to the Mars orbiters \nsupporting MSL’s landing.  The tones and data transmitted \nover these links are selected carefully to reflect the most \nessential parameters of the vehicle’s state and the performance \nof the EDL subsystems for post-EDL reconstruction should no \nfurther data transmission from the vehicle be possible.  This \npaper addresses the configuration of the X band receive system \nused at NASA / JPL’s Deep Space Network \(DSN and tone signal, \nexamines the MSL vehicle state information obtained from the \nX band carrier signal only and contrasts the Doppler-derived \ninformation against the post-EDL known vehicle state. \nThe paper begins with a description of the MSL EDL sequence \nof events and discusses the impact of the EDL maneuvers such \nas guided entry, parachute deploy, and powered descent on the \nfrequency observables expected at the DSN.  The range of nDoppler dynamics possible is derived from extensive 6 \nDegrees-Of-Freedom \(6 DOF nperformed by MSL’s EDL simulation team.  The configuration \nof the DSN’s receive system, using the Radio Science Receivers \n\(RSR is detailed.  Expected signal \ncarrier power-to-noise levels during EDL are shown and their \nimpact on signal detection is considered.  Particular attention \nis given to the selection of the appropriate RSR processing nbandwidths and to its configuration for real-time signal \ndetection.  The X-band carrier frequency obtained through \npost-processing of the open-loop recorded spectrum is given.   \nDetection of spacecraft status and completion of key vehicle \nevents through their Doppler signature is discussed and \nillustrated.  This Doppler-derived information is compared \nagainst the very accurate vehicle data obtained post-EDL via \nMSL’s UHF radio subsystem.  The paper concludes with a \ndiscussion on the advantages and disadvantages of ntransmitting the X-band carrier and tone signal in the general \ncontext of EDL communications and lessons learned for future \nmissions with EDL sequences are given.  \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n1.

INTRODUCTION \nSpacecraft designers and mission operators often cite the \nEntry, Descent and Landing phase of each Mars mission as \nthe most challenging and tense mission phase.   During \nthese few minutes, the vehicle autonomously executes \nhundreds of events, shedding its cruise stage, deploying its \nparachute ejecting its heat shield, computing the distance to \nthe surface and lowering the lander/ rover for final landing \non the planet.  Depending on the mission design and \ndistance between Earth and Mars, the one-way signal \nlatency can vary from 4 to 20 minutes, thus ensuring that all \nevents must be carried out without intervention from the \nflight operations team.  Only essential subsystems related to \nvehicle survival during EDL are operated so that the \navionics can be focused on rapidly acquiring sensor data and \nperforming the required computations to trigger each event \nprecisely.   Ensuring data flow to Earth or adjusting the nvehicle’s attitude to maximize data return may only \ndecrease mission success.  Yet acquiring vehicle status ninformation is critical to understanding the performance of \nthe complex EDL system, and in the advent of a failure, this \ndata may only be obtained during EDL.    \n2 \nThe Mars Pathfinder \(MPF NASA \nmission to attempt to use the X-band communication \nsubsystem to reconstruct the performance of the spacecraft \nduring EDL [1]. The concept was simple. On July 4th, 1997, \nduring EDL, no attempt to control the 


spacecraft attitude to \nEarth for the benefit of the communication signal was \nundertaken. Instead an unmodulated carrier signal was \ntransmitted from the ~15W Solid State Amplifier;  this was \nrecorded and processed in near-real time at the only Deep \nSpace Network Complex in the line-of-sight to MPF to \ndetermine its Doppler.  From the Doppler signature, the \nspacecraft motion and status in the EDL sequence was ndetermined.  In addition, at three critical moments, a second \nsignal at a subcarrier frequency of 22.5 KHz or 375 KHz \nwas transmitted in order to signal heat shield release, full \nextension of the bridle separating the lander from the \nparachute, and when the lander was determined by the \nvehicle’s radar to be 600 meters above the surface.  Once on \nthe surface, the carrier was turned on and off to indicate \nprogress in the lander’s deployment.  At the DSN, a Full \nSpectrum Recorder \(FSR simple Fast Fourier Transforms \(FFTs nFor MPF, it was possible to detect the carrier in real-time \nduring the majority of EDL, but it was not possible to detect \nany of the semaphores in real time.  This innovative scheme, \ndesigned by Gordon Wood et al., allowed mission operators \nto determine that the spacecraft was still functioning during \nkey moments as it descended onto the Martian surface.  Post \nEDL data processing permitted tracking of the carrier nthroughout much of EDL and recovery of one of the three \nsemaphores, thus confirming the power of this technique.  \nThe Mars Exploration Rovers Spirit and Opportunity, \nlanding on 1/4/2004 and 1/26/2004 respectively, build upon \nthe MPF signaling scheme.  Using a newer version of the \nFSR called the Radio Science Receivers [2] and dedicated \nreal-time data processing hardware, the EDL Data Analysis \nequipment [3 the mission operations team was able to \nreceive in real-time the carrier signal and semaphores \ntransmitted every 10 sec representing the specific spacecraft \nstate.  In addition, the MERs successfully transmitted 8 nKbps digital data to the Mars Global Surveyor and Mars \nOdyssey orbiters. [4]  \nThis paper describes the Mars Science Laboratory X-band \nsignaling scheme, built upon the successful MPF and MER \nschemes, and focuses on how detection of this signal \nallowed the mission operators to confirm MSL’s status in \nreal-time and via post processing.   \n2. MSL SYSTEM OVERVIEW \nAlthough orientation to maximize telecom performance is \nnot possible antennas are especially designed and mounted \nto provide the best possible line of sight to Earth and to the nMars orbiters supporting MSL’s landing.  The information \nin the X-band Multiple Frequency Shift Keying MFSK EDL and Fault \nProtection engineers to reflect the most essential parameters \nof the vehicle’s state and denote the key real-time EDL \nsubsystems status.  During MSL Operational Readiness \nTests this data set is examined by each subsystem team to \nverify that it contains the information needed to reconstruct \nthe vehicle state and possible fault status should no further \ndata transmission from the vehicle be possible post EDL nThe choice of tones and data transmitted is difficult given \nthe limited set of 10sec tones during the 7 minute EDL \ntimeline and the 8 Kbps maximum data rate supported to the \norbiters at UHF.   \nThis article deals only with the reception of X-Band signals \nvia the RSR.  Although UHF played a critical role in EDL \nand permitted reception of the carrier and retrieval of digital \ndata from the rover through successful touchdown the role \nof the UHF subsystem in EDL is outside the scope of this \narticle. \nX-Band Telecom Subsystem Overview \nThe MSL X-Band subsystem information relevant to its \nperformance during the Approach, Entry Descent and \nLanding \(AEDL Telecom subsystem, \nand Table 1 defines selected terms used in Figure 1.  Much \nof the telecom subsystem description provided here is taken \ndirectly from [6] and readers are referred to that article for \ndetails n \nFigure 1 – The MSL X-Band Telecom Subsystem \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3 \nTable 1. Terms used in Figure 1: the X-Band Block \nDiagram  \n \nThe X-band telecom components in the cruise, parachute \ncone and descent stage are used during AEDL as follows: \n\(1 MGA Tilted LGA or TLGA, and \nthe Descent LGA or DLGA are used in a sequential \nfashion.  Nominally, at the beginning of the AEDL \nmission phase, the vehicle is configured by the \nspacecraft avionics or Rover Compute Element \(RCE RCP progresses, the \nappropriate Waveguide Transfer Switches \(WTS PLGA, \nTLGA and finally the DLGA.  \n\(2 SDST Tube Amplifier \(TWTA AEDL.  MSL’s Fault Protection \nsystem did not permit switch over to the rover SDST \nand Solid State Power Amplifier \(SSPA stream and at Entry – 11 \nminutes is configured to generate an MFSK signal with \nresidual carrier.   This modulation is preferred over a \nBPSK digital modulation as it would not be possible to \nensure closed-loop operation of a ground receiver \nthroughout EDL due to the high and unpredictable \nDoppler dynamics present on 


the carrier signal.  The \nSDST therefore transmits a constant carrier signal \nmodulated by a single tone frequency.  The latter is \nconfigured by the RCE to change every 10 seconds to \nreflect the spacecraft state nThe key stages of EDL are shown in Figure 2, Figure 3, \nFigure 4 inclusive.  These provide a pictorial narrative of \nEDL.  Figure 5 complements Figure 2, Figure 3, and Figure \n4 by showing key Telecom events during EDL, including \nthe key X-Band events that are the focus of this document.  \n \nFigure 2 – Timeline Cruise stage separation to entry \ninterface \n \n \nFigure 3 – EDL timeline: entry interface to backshell nseparation \n \n \nFigure 4 – EDL timeline: backshell separation to fly-\naway  \n \n \n \n4 \n \n \nFigure 5 – Telecom events and antenna usage during \nEDL.  The letter “E” denotes atmospheric entry. \nDue to occultation of Earth from the vehicle line-of-sight \nduring the last 2 minutes of EDL, it was expected that the \nX-Band communications would be lost.  Indeed, as \nanticipated, communications were lost due to Earth set at \nE+299 seconds where E denotes atmospheric entry. \nSince two-way coherent communications, in which the \nspacecraft transponder uses an uplink signal from Earth as a \nfrequency reference and in which the downlink signal is nfully coherent with the uplink, could not be maintained \nreliably under EDL conditions, X-Band signals during EDL \nwere transmitted with the SDST set to 1-way mode using its \ninternal auxiliary crystal oscillator \(AUX OSC 4. \nApproximately 10 minutes prior to the entering into Mars’ \natmosphere, the vehicle cruise stage is separated from \nMSL’s descent stage separation occurred as planned, \nresulting in the loss of the MGA used through much of the \nlater part of cruise.  The PLGA was thus used during the \nearlier portions of EDL to send tones.  However, during the \nbanking maneuvers, the TLGA provided a better angle to \nEarth than the PLGA could have, and the TLGA was thus \nselected 20 seconds prior to atmospheric entry.  Finally, \nonce the backshell separated, the TLGA and the PLGA were \nboth lost, resulting in the use of the descent stage LGA \n\(DLGA However, backshell separation occurred after \nEarth occultation, as expected, which means that none of the ntones radiated via the DLGA could be received on Earth. \nSince components in the parachute cone and descent stage \nwere chiefly used during EDL, the rover stage X-Band \ncomponents were not used.  Moreover, since the descent \nstage SDST and TWTA were both used, radiated power \(via \nthe 100 watt TWTA could have \nbeen achieved using the 15-watt SSPA.  Moreover, the \nTLGA provided a better Earth view angle during tones \nradiation \(the portions viewable prior to Earth occultation using the PLGA.  These are \njust some of the improvements over MER EDL. \nMER EDL X-Band Comparison \nThe MER X-Band subsystem and EDL information, based \non [7], are presented for comparison purposes.  The \nTelecom subsystem diagram for MER is shown in Figure 6, \nand a pictorial representation of MER EDL events is shown \nin Figure 7.  \n \nFigure 6 – MER Telecom Subsystem \n \n \nFigure 7 – Pictorial representation of MER EDL events nThere are several differences between the MSL and MER \nX-band communications subsystem and their use in AEDL n\(1 na. MER telecom system possessed one SDST and two \nSSPAs, all of which were located in the rover.   \nb. The SSPAs were limited to 15 Watts.  The 100 \nWatt TWTA was added to MSL’s telecom \nsubsystem specifically to support signaling during \nEDL given the MSL to Earth distance of 1.66 AU \nin contrast with the 1.33 AU distance for the \nOpportunity \(MER-B nsequentially as follows: the Cruise LGA \(CLGA BLGA RLGA Petal LGA \(PLGA 2 non the same circular waveguide “stack”.  During \nthe course of EDL, as stages separated, portions of \nthe stack “broke off” as planned.  For example, the \nCLGA was lost with cruise stage separation, \nleaving the BLGA behind.  Separation of the rover \non the bridle during EDL and bridle cut left the \nrover with only the RLGA and the PLGA. \nb. In MSL, the descent stage X-band components \nwere used to generate the carrier and tone signals \nby the RCE located in the rover.  Once the descent \nstage had separated from the rover, the last tone ncommanded continued to be transmitted \(although \ndue to the timing and geometry of the landing site, \nthere was no line of sight between the descent stage \nand Earth at that time to be sent post-landing from the rover \nSDST and SSPA using the RLGA and the PLGA \n[7]. \n\(3 scenarios differed: \na. In MSL’s case, Earth occultation occurred prior to \ngoing to the DLGA so no tones sent via the DLGA \ncould be received. \nb. In MER’s case, X-Band signals continued to be \nseen on Earth well after safe, successful landing for \nboth rovers. \n3. DSN SYSTEM OVERVIEW \nThe Deep Space Network of NASA is comprised of three \nantenna complexes around the world. Each complex \ncontains one antenna that is 70 meters in diameter and at \nleast two antennas that are 34 meters in diameter. The \nstations have two types of tracking receivers, one of which \nlocks onto the carrier signal in a “closed-loop” fashion and \nis known as the Block-V receiver. The second type of \nreceiver, known as “open-loop,” does not lock onto a signal \nbut 


rather is tuned by pre-determined frequency predictions \nand records a certain segment of the electromagnetic nspectrum which is then down-converted to an intermediate \nfrequency centered about that prediction. These open-loop \nreceivers, also known as radio science receivers \(RSRs experiments, but their ability \nto record a frequency spectrum without needing to lock onto \na signal makes them ideal for activities involving signals \nthat are weak or which may have sudden, unpredictable \nDoppler shifts. The entry and descent of the Curiosity rover \nis one example of such a case. The RSRs are controlled nremotely from the Radio Science Operations computers \n\(RSOPS Complex \ntracked Curiosity during its final approach and descent. In \nparticular, the 70-meter station, DSS 43, tracked Curiosity, \nand the RSR was configured to record the signal acquired at \nthis station. A spacecraft trajectory was generated by the \nCuriosity navigation team to account for the Doppler shift nbetween Curiosity and DSS 43. Slowing of the spacecraft \ndue to the Martian atmosphere was included in this ntrajectory, but the deployment of Curiosity’s parachute was \ndeliberately excluded since the timing of that event could \nnot be reliably predicted. This trajectory was used by the \nDSN to calculate a frequency prediction for the event. With \nparachute deployment left out from the frequency \nprediction, this event would stand out in the Doppler profile \nin real time during the event. \n \nFigure 8 – MSL Radio Science Receiver Data Flow \nSeveral different bandwidths were configured on the RSR \nfor recording of the signal. The primary channel was \nconfigured with a 100-KHz bandwidth, and the data were \npassed in real time to a separate piece of hardware known as \nthe Entry Descent Assembly \(EDA detected a number of \ntones within the bandwidth that were used to identify \nvarious events occurring on the spacecraft, and the \nsuccession of these events was displayed in real time in the \nJPL Mission Support Area MSA Odyssey orbiter, the EDA would \nprovide another source of information until the point at \nwhich the spacecraft was geometrically occulted by Mars. \nThe tones were to occur within a 20 KHz range, but another \n20 KHz on either side were added to account for uncertainty \nregarding the frequency drift of the spacecraft’s Auxiliary nOscillator caused by temperature variation. The closest \n6 \navailable setting on the RSR to account for this range was \n100 KHz. \nSeveral other bandwidths were configured, including a 1-\nMHz setting as a “fallback” in case of any unforeseen \nDoppler shifts. Narrower channels were recorded as well, \nincluding 8, 16, 25, and 50 KHz.  \nThe MSL EDL signal was also recorded on the expected \nRCP antenna channel as well as the LCP channel The latter \nwas to serve as a further backup in case an off-nominal \ntrajectory would result in antenna line-of-sight to Earth at \nfar larger off-boresight angles than expected. When \npossible, narrower bandwidths are used because weaker \nsignals tend to be easier to detect due to less noise. Also, a \nsmaller data volume facilitates post-processing. The sum of \nthe Doppler shift induced by temperature variation and \nsuccessful parachute deployment ultimately totaled around \n12 KHz, too close to the edge of the 25-KHz bandwidth, and noutside that tracked by the 8- or 16-KHz bandwidths. \nTherefore, the 50-KHz data are primarily shown in this npaper. All data were transferred from the RSR to the Radio \nOccultation Data Analysis Network \(RODAN for \narchival.. \nGround System Support \nDue to differences in Earth-Mars geometry during MSL \nEDL and during MER EDL, MSL had only single DSN \ncomplex support via the Canberra complex.  This was the \nonly DSN station in view during MSL EDL.  By contrast, \nMER had dual complex support.  A failure of one 70-meter \nantenna could have been compensated by the 70-meter \nantenna at the other complex. Also, MSL EDL suffered \nfrom a partial Earth occultation \(Earth setting in the Martian \nsky as seen by the MSL spacecraft during EDL not encountered, so X-Band tones could not be used to \nverify a successful landing.  Rather, successful landing was \nverified by means of UHF relay via the Odyssey orbiter and \nby the camera images sent back from the surface as a part of \nthis UHF relay, which is out of the scope of this paper. \n4. EXPECTED EDL PERFORMANCE \nCommunication Link Performance Simulation \nThe MSL EDL team developed an end-to-end performance nsimulation tool to assess the operation of each subsystem \nand thereby determine the success of landing under a variety \nof input conditions.  This Program to Optimize Simulated \nTrajectories version 2, or POST2, was built upon previous \nversions developed for earlier Mars EDL missions and \ncustomized to reflect the specific EDL system used for MSL \n[8].  POST2 performs a Monte Carlo simulation to generate \na statistical model of the spacecraft trajectory using the \nuncertainties in the atmospheric models, the aerodynamic \nspacecraft models the mass properties, and the performance \nof the EDL subsystems as inputs variables.   Given the \ncurrent understanding and configuration of the EDL system, \nmultiple EDL runs are simulated.  The specific performance nunder a particular set of conditions is stored and a statistical \nmodel of the performance of the system is derived. \nFigure 9 gives the carrier frequency and received signal \npower performance from a nominal POST2 run.  This run \nwas generated five months before EDL using the highest \nfidelity model of the EDL system at 


that time.  \n \nFigure 9 – Simulated carrier frequency and received \npower signal dynamics for a nominal POST2 EDL run. \nThe simulation commences at Entry – 9 minutes, or -540 \nsec, when the spacecraft begins its Turn to Entry as depicted \nin Figure 2, and lasts until the Earth is no longer visible to \nthe vehicle.  The Loss-of-Signal is caused by the vehicle \ndescending into Gale Crater and by the Earth setting over \nthe crater’s rim.  This LOS was predicted to occur for MSL \nabout 10 sec after heatshield deploy.  Thus, there would be \nno link to Earth during the powered flight phase of EDL.   \nHowever, as will now be described, many of the vehicle \nstates from Turn to Entry to Backshell separation shown in \nFigure 2 and Figure 3 could be deduced from the frequency \nand power signature of the signal.   \nWalking though the events from E – 9 minutes to LOS, we \ncan determine which events can be determined from the \ncarrier observables.  The overall frequency profile clearly \nshows the frequency shift due to the spacecraft’s \nacceleration as it is pulled towards Mars due to the \ngravitational force between the two objects.  About 50 sec \nafter hitting the Mars Entry Interface, defined to be 3522.2 \nkm above Mars, the spacecraft’s velocity is reduced as it \nplows through the Mars atmosphere, reaching maximum \nheating and then peak deceleration at about E + 75 sec.  \nPeak deceleration is clearly visible in Doppler rate.  The \nimmediate deceleration caused by the parachute deploy is nunmistakable at E + 250 sec as a Doppler frequency rate \nspike of 1.7 KHz/sec and less visible in the Doppler nsignature by a ~ 4KHz frequency change. The effect of the \npyrotechnic blowing off of the parachute canister cap can be \nseen as a negative-going Doppler rate spike a few seconds \nprior to parachute deploy.  \n7 \n20 seconds prior to hitting the Mars Entry, the spacecraft \nautonomously switches from the PLGA to TLGA antenna nThe simulation predicts a small drop in power, but in reality, \na small signal outage was expected as the TWTA, shown in \nFigure 1, is set to standby prior to commanding the \nparachute waveguide transfer switch Another critical event \nis cruise ballast mass \(CBM spacecraft to enter the Guided Entry phase of \nEDL as ejecting these masses permit the spacecraft to set its nentry attitude.  The event occurs after E – 9 min as the \nspacecraft begins to despin from its nominal cruise rate of 2 \nHz/sec.  This event cannot be seen on the Doppler frequency \nprofile as the departure of the masses does not create a \ndiscernable change in Doppler rate.   During peak \ndeceleration, the vehicle begins its banking maneuvers, \ncharacteristic of guided entry.  Nominally there are three \nmaneuvers lasting from ~ E 80 sec to E + 135 sec.  Their \nimpact on received power at Earth can be seen clearly in the \nsimulation by the three cycles of changing transmitter, or \nantenna, boresight and azimuthal angles and in the resultant nreceived power.  \nTable 2 lists the key spacecraft events during EDL along \nwith the mean value of the times at which they occur as well \nas the 1% and 99% cumulative distribution values as given \nby a POST2 simulation prior to EDL.  Table 3 lists the key \nEDL events that are theoretically possible to be determined \nby carrier observables.  The mean time of occurrence and \nthe 1% timing error bars around the mean are given based \non the POST2 simulation runs.  Table 9 lists the key AEDL \nevents, including those specific to the telecom subsystem, \nand notes whether they can be detected via carrier \nobservables.  The telecom specific events are significant as \ntheir timing shows successful progression through the EDL \nsequence of events performed autonomously by the \nvehicle’s computer.  All potentially discernable AEDL \nevents are listed, although in the specific case of the Gale \nCrater landing, no events post Earth set can be detected. \nAs mentioned in Section 3, the DSN configured DSS 43, the \n70m antenna complex, and DSS 34 and DSS 45, two 34m \nantenna complexes to track MSL and receive its signal.  In \naddition, the 70 m antenna was arrayed with the two 34m \nantennas in order to increase the received signal strength.  \nRSRs were deployed both the RCP \(expected nsignals received by DSS 43 and on the arrayed RCP signal.    \nVarious RSR recording channel bandwidths were selected to \nmaximize real-time visibility and to record all possible \ntraces of the signal in the advent of an anomalous vehicle \ntrajectory.   \nThe RSRs require that a carrier frequency predict file be \ninput as a reference for RF downconversion prior to \nsampling the IF signal.  The frequency predict file is based \non the motion of the center of mass of the spacecraft, as \npredicted by the mission navigation team, relative to a nspecific DSN antenna used.  The frequency of the IF signal \ndisplayed by the RSR and input to the EDA is thus the \ndifference between the input sky frequency and the carrier \nfrequency predict file.   \nTable 2  – Key EDL Events and Expected Time of \nOccurrence \(from pre-EDL POST2 simulation Detectability via \nCarrier Observables \n  \nIn order to improve the detectability of the EDL events \nlisted in Table 3 the navigation team was requested not to \ninclude banking or parachute deploy in the frequency npredict file as these events cannot be accurately predicted.  \nThis ensured that the dynamics induced by the actual event \nwould be easier to detect by the EDL Communications \noperations team.  In order to determine the minimum RSR \n8 \nbandwidth to capture the transmitted carrier and any of the \npossible 256 tones, POST2 simulations were run to examine \nthe impact of variations in the Flight Path Angle \(FPA 


the spacecraft hits the atmosphere at the \nEntry Interface point, or the swinging, or wrist, motion of \nthe vehicle on the parachute would be on the predicted \nDoppler frequency.  FPAs from -15.5 +/- 0.05 were run and nthe 50th highest wrist mode cases were examined.  Figure \n10, Figure 11, Figure 12, and Figure 13 depict the impact of \nwrist motion on the received signal frequency, frequency \nrate, and on the signal power.    \n nFigure 10 – Carrier frequency Doppler shift, 50 cases \npeak wrist mode simulation. \n \n \nFigure 11 – Tornado plot of carrier frequency Doppler \nshift at parachute deploy, 50 cases peak wrist mode \nsimulation. \n \n nFigure 12 – Carrier frequency Doppler rate, 50 cases \npeak wrist mode simulation. \n \n \nFigure 13 – Received signal power, 50 cases peak wrist \nmode simulation. \nIn Figure 14 the effect of an early chute deploy trajectory \nand a late chute deploy trajectory on the frequency residual \nseen by the RSR and the EDA is shown.  The early and late \nchute trajectories are taken from the bounding cases shown \nin the tornado plot in Figure 11 and a nominal trajectory \nwithout parachute deploy is taken as that used for the RSR \npredict.  The signature of early vs. late parachute deploy is \nclear on the frequency residual.   In fact, the initial residual \ncaused by atmospheric deceleration signals whether the \nparachute deploy will be early \(negative initial frequency \nshift positive initial frequency shift calculated frequency residuals \nfor an early and late parachute deploy trajectory \nassuming a nominal trajectory used as the RSR predicts. \n \nUse of One-Way Downlink Mode \nAs stated previously, the free-running AUX OSC crystal \noscillator was used for MSL as well as for MER EDL.  This, \ncombined with high Doppler dynamics during EDL, \npresented a number of challenges.  Cruise temperatures \nremained quasi-steady, with changes occurring very slowly.  \nThis made AUX OSC frequency quite predictable.  For this \nreason, MSL Telecom had taken a time series of AUX OSC \nfrequencies versus temperature during the course of cruise \nin order to derive AUX OSC frequency as a function of \ntemperature. \nSince the Radio Science Receiver \(RSR bandwidth of \n+/- 50 kHz \(100 kHz in all large frequency \nvariations, and temperature changes to the non-temperature-\ncompensated AUX OSC crystal oscillator would both result \nin significant variations in downlink frequency.  Hence, \nRSR bandwidth had to be wide enough to accommodate: \n\(1 2 bandwidth of +/- 20 kHz, since subcarrier \ntones ranged in frequency up to 20 kHz. \n\(3 output frequency due to \ntemperature changes during EDL. \nMSL Telecom had determined, on the basis of AUX OSC noutput frequency during cruise that the AUX OSC would \nlikely undergo an increase in output frequency of as much \nas 9 kHz if temperatures were to rise from approximately -\n2.5 deg C \(cruise nominal value close to EDL up to about \n+15 deg C.  This was based upon data taken in cruise shown \nin Figure 15. \n \nFigure 15 Polynomial best fit to cruise AUX OSC data \nfrom descent stage SDST \nActual temperature versus time data are shown in Figure 15 \nbelow.  Here, we note that the baseplate temperature rose \nquite sharply compared to AUX OSC and VCO temperature \nmeasurements, which indicates the SDST itself was not in \nthermal equilibrium during EDL.  As a consequence, the \nactual frequency variation appeared to be less than what we \nanticipated based on baseplate temperature predictions \n \nFigure 16 – SDST temperatures during EDL.   \nNote that baseplate temperature rises much more rapidly \nthan internal AUX OSC and VCO temperatures, indicating \nno thermal equilibrium during EDL \n10 \nSince the actual EDL temperature variation was from -1.0 deg \nC to almost +12 deg C measured at the SDST mounting plate, \none would expect a nearly +7 kHz increase in output \nfrequency However, the actual frequency rise was \nsignificantly lower, only about +3.5 kHz.  It is believed that \nthe SDST was likely not in thermal equilibrium during the \ncourse of EDL, and Figure 15 above shows that baseplate ntemperature rose much faster than actual oscillator \ntemperature.  However, predictions of downlink frequency nvariation had to be based on baseplate temperature because \ninternal oscillator temperature predicts were unavailable: only \nbaseplate temperature predicts were available. \nThe “actual” variation of +3.5 kHz is based on the \nassumption that EDL frequency predicts made prior to EDL \nfaithfully model the Doppler dynamics leaving remaining \nfrequency variation only to AUX OSC temperature \nvariation.  Readers are cautioned that this is an imperfect \nassumption that would reduce the accuracy of the statement \nthat AUX OSC frequency output variation due to \ntemperature was approximately +3.5 kHz.  Barring the \navailability of improved a posteriori EDL frequency \npredicts, it is impossible to determine the actual AUX OSC \ntemperature-based frequency variation with greater \naccuracy.  However, we are able to state that the variation \nbeyond Doppler predicts due to dynamics was smaller-than-\nexpected.  Hence, although the analysis proved to be \nconservative it was still adequate for the purposes of \nassessing RSR bandwidth. \n5. EDL PERFORMANCE \nFigure 17 and Figure 18 illustrate the real time performance \nof the RSR.  Figure 17 shows the spectrum of the carrier \nsignal recorded in a 25 KHz channel prior to cruise stage \nseparation.  The signal is transmitted from the spacecraft’s \nMGA, its power to noise level is measured at 35 dB-Hz. \n \n \nFigure 17 – Example of Real-time RSR 


FFT SNR \nFigure 18 gives the frequency residual of the carrier during \nthe vehicle banking after Entry.   The frequency excursion at \n5:23:26 UTC is an erroneous data point resulting from the \npower loss caused by the switch from the PLGA to the \nTLGA. \n \nFigure 18 – Example of Real-time RSR Frequency \nResidual \nFigure 19 Figure 20, and Figure 21 are the result of post-\nprocessing of the RSR data.   Figure 19 shows the frequency nsignature of 2 rpm caused by the MSL spin-stabilized cruise \nstage.   Figure 20 gives the carrier signal-to-noise and \nresidual frequency during the Approach, Entry, Descent, \nand Landing Phase.  Key events are inscribed in the figure.  \nFinally Figure 21 lists the carrier signal-to-noise and \nresidual frequency at the time of parachute deploy.  The \nparachute deploy event is clearly seen to occur at 5:28:54 \nUTC.  \n nFigure 19 – MSL EDL X-Band DSS-43 Signal-to-Noise \nRatio and Residual Frequency – Spacecraft Spin  \n \n \n11 nFigure 20 – MSL EDL X-Band DSS-43 Signal-to-Noise \nRatio and Residual Frequency during the last 20 \nminutes \n n \nFigure 21 – MSL EDL X-Band DSS-43 Signal-to-Noise \nRatio and Residual Frequency at Parachute Deploy \n6 CONCLUSIONS \nMany of the critical events occurring during the newly \ndeveloped MSL EDL sequence have been detected by \nexamination of the transmitted X-band carrier signal \ntransmitted during EDL.  In particular, we have shown that \nby correlating the received power and frequency of the X-\nband signal accurate evaluation of the spacecraft spin, entry, \nantenna sequence, parachute deploy can be made.  The use \nof the RSR combined with FFT signal processing \ntechniques has been shown to be effective in determining \nspacecraft critical information from MPF to MER to the \nhighly dynamic MSL entry.  The hardware and signal \nprocessing techniques are simple and effective and will \ncontinue to allow effective sleuthing of spacecraft status for \nthe next generation of Deep Space Missions. \n7.

Conclusions The SHOTPUT mission , its unique trajectory and potential encounter with six different small bodies will provide a novel view of the composition of the solar system. The science return from the mission will help answer questions on formation, composition and evolution of small bodies in our local neighborhood In addition, the team has proposed a mission that is within budget based on heritage instruments satisfying the decadal survey requirements. The opportunity for spectacular science return on this rare trajectory should not be missed The innovative SHOTPUT mission is truly one of a kind Acknowledgements The authors would like to thank Anita Sohus, Amber Norton and JPL Team X for their contributions to this work.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
