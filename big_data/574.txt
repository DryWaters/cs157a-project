After the full study of \nlogistics information, we make a statistical analysis for the text \nlogistics information and summarize the common attributes of \ntext information entity. According to the different attributes \nand attribute values, we divided text information entity by the \nidea of divide and conquer. As to the entity we get from last \nstep we make an internal processing based on segmentation \nmethod of tagging and graph. We extracted valuable attributes \nand attribute values from the unstructured data. Experimental \nresults show that this method is valid for the logistics \ninformation which we achieve from a well-known logistics \nsystem nKeywords—unstructured data; information; extraction; \nlogistics information; divide-and-conquer method; words nsegmentation; \nI. INTRODUCTION \nWith the popularity of computers and the rapid \ndevelopment of the Internet the information also grows \nexplosively. Currently there are a lot of electronic \nunstructured texts on the internet, such as news, micro-blog, \nemail, chats, government documents, etc. [1]. It is a \nchallenge that how to arrange, extract and organize the large \nnumber of disorder text information to make them in a \nmanageable form. Due to the huge amount of data and \nheterogeneity of data, we urgently need to use the computer \nto extract the unstructured information from the internet \nwhich is explosive automatically, instead of depending on \nmanual work to finish the transformation [1]. \nIn recent years, the applications and researches of ninformation extraction technology are booming. The \ncapabilities of multilingual text processing, the technology \nof the deep understanding exploring, the techniques of \ndiscourse analysis, techniques of machine learning, time \ninformation processing and information extracting from \nweb have caught the attention of the researchers [2] [3]. On \nthe other hand, more and more fields make use of \ninformation extraction technology Some are the parts of \nstrong functional information service systems which are \nestablished by combining the technologies of document \nprocessing and information extraction, and some are \nself-made systems [4] [5]. At present, NIST \(National \nInstitute of Standards and Technology Automatic Content Extraction, \nAutomatic Content Extraction information extraction research. The \nevaluation was officially launched at the end of 2000, and \nso far there are three evaluations. The purpose of carrying \nout this evaluation is to process language text getting from nOCR text ,common text and ASR text automatically by \nresearching and developing the technology of information nextraction automatically, whose work is to study how to \nextract related information of events relationships, physical \nappearing on news automatically [4] [5]. \nIt is a little later that studying Chinese information \nextraction, because of the characteristic peculiarity of \nChinese that makes it much more difficult to build Chinese \ninformation extraction system. At present, some domestic \nuniversities and research institutions conduct relevant \nresearches, such as Peking University, Shanghai Jiao Tong \nUniversity Harbin Institute of Technology and the Chinese \nAcademy of Sciences [4] [6], and the key point of their nstudies is a simple information extraction and recognition of \nChinese name entity. Now it is a hot research of designing a \nsystem which can completely extract information. \nSingapore, Kent Ridge Digital Labs \(Kent Ridge Digital \nLabs Taiwan University conference and evaluate the \nChinese named entity. Zhang Yimin \(Intel China Research \nCenter Chinese named entity extraction and \nrelationship extraction system that was demonstrated in the nACL-2000.This system makes use of MBL \(memory-based \nlearning, Memory-Based Learning nrules and extracts the information successfully. In the field \nof automatic recognition of Chinese named entity, it has got \na good performance. Che Wanxiang makes use of Winnow \nand SVM \(machine learning algorithm which is supervised \nand based on a feature vector Conference on Cloud Computing and Big Data\n978-1-4799-2829-3/13 $26.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/CLOUDCOM-ASIA.2013.104\n57030 9 4 31 4\nsuccessfully [4]  [5]. \nCurrently, information extraction technology regards \nentities as the kernel [1]. Entity is the thing that exists \nindependently. Different kinds of entities have different \nproperties generally, and the same kind of entities generally \nhas substantially the same properties, but their property \nvalues will be different [1]. For example, the entity n“People”, usually includes nationality, date of birth, \noccupation, graduate schools and so on; "Movies category \nentities contain director, starring, screenwriter and other \nattributes [1]. Unstructured entity attribute value extraction \nis to extract entity attributes and attribute values from a \ngiven entity to form a structured data. \nThis paper proposes a way that extracts attributes of \ngiven entity which is unstructured 


text information of the \nfield of logistics. The contributions of this paper are as \nfollows: \(1 full study of logistics information, we \nmake a statistical analysis for the text information of \nlogistics information and summarize the common attributes \nof the text information entity. According to the different nattributes and attribute values, we identify and segment the \ntext information into sub entity by using the idea of \ndivide-and-conquer. \(2 which got from the \nfirst step, we further extracted valuable attributes and \nattribute values from the unstructured text information.  \nII. THE INFORMATION EXTRACTION ALGORITHM BASED ON \nDIVIDE-AND-CONQUER AND HEURISTIC \nIn this paper we analysis the entities of logistics \ninformation. After statistical analysis of the logistics \ninformation, we extract the common attributes of the entities, \nand then take the advantage of divide-and-conquer to \nsegment the whole logistics information into some sub \nentities [7] [8]. At last we identify \(tag values [3] [9] [10]. \nThe algorithm can be described as follows: \nStep 1: input the original non-structured logistics \ninformation S; \nStep 2: identify the original data S, and record the tags \nof according to the tags, segment the original \ndata S into sub entities: A\(area provide require nO\(other provide-and-require”\(P-R describe as algorithm2.2 and extract the attributes \n“place name”\(PN describe as \nalgorithm2.3 entities O is ignored; store the structured \ndata which extract from step 3 and step 4 into databases and noutput them; \nThe flow diagram of the algorithm is as follows: \n \nFig.1.  Flow diagram of the structured process of logistics information \nA. The entity segmentation algorithm based on \nDivide-and-Conquer \n\(i analysis of the constitute of the logistics information \nThe data in the existed logistics information system is \nvariable and fickle, but the words used in logistics \ninformation and context are simplex and regular After \nstatistical analysis of the logistics information, find that \nlogistics information includes three parts: place sub field, \nprovider sub field, require sub field. Besides we also find \nthat the words in the logistics information and context are \nregular and limited. The Place sub field is usually related to \nthe place tag words such as “?”, “?”, “?”; Provider sub \nfield and Require sub field are often followed with provider \ntag words and require tag words like “?”, “?”, “?” and \nso on [3] [11] [12] [13] [14]. In this paper we segment a \nlogistics information entity into several different sub entities, \nnamely Place sub field, place tag words, Provider sub field, \nprovider tag words, Require sub field, require tag words and \nothers. The classification is as table 1: \nTABLE I. WORD TAG CLASSIFICATION \nsymbol significance example\n@ \nThe symbol of place \ninformation, the string before \n?????\n????\n571\nit can be place information \n$ \nThe symbol of require ninformation, the string before \nit can be require information \n?  ???\n?\n# \nThe symbol of provider ninformation, the string before \nit can be require information \n??  ??\n?\nA \nThe entity of place, consist of nplace information \n?????\n????\nP \nThe entity of provider, consist \nof provider information \n??  ??\n?\nR nThe entity of require, consist \nof require information \n?  ???\n?\nO \nothers ???? ??\n???\nAfter statistical analysis of thousands of logistics \ninformation, the tag words usually used are classified as \nfollows: \nPlace tag words: @={“->”, “-”, “--”, “=>”, “??”, \n“?”, “?”, “?”, “?”, “??”}; \nProvider tag words: #={“?”}; \nRequire tag words: $={“?”, “?”, “?” }; \nThe algorithm of Sub entity segment is described as \nfollows: \nStep 1: input the original non-structured logistics \ninformation S; \nStep 2 : scan the chars in the string S from left to right; \nif the char is in the set of tag words, store the location of the \nchar and use the symbol to replace the char; else, process \nthe next char ; \nStep 3: repeat the step 2 until to the end of the string S; \nStep 4 if there are tag words in the original string S, \nsegment string S into sub string A, P, R, O according to nlocation of the tag words “@”, “$”, “#”; else, give up the \nstring S; \nThe pseudo code for the entity segmentation algorithm \nbased on Divide-and-Conquer is as follows: \nBegin \nInput S; \nLength  n; \nfor i1 to n do \n{ \nGet the char Ci; \nIf Ci?the set of tag words then store i; Ci \n{“@”,”$”,”#”}; \n} \nsegment S into A, P R, O according to location of \n“@”,”$”,”#” \noutput A, P, R; \nEnd \nTake this for example: \n?????????? 50 13 ???\n??????????????????: \nThe segment of this logistics information entity is as \nfollow: \n \nThe “A” before and after “@” represent the sub entity \nof place; the “P” after “#” represents the sub entity of \nprovider the “R” after “$” represents the sub entity of \nrequire. “O” represents others \(in this paper we ignore the nsub entity “O segmented into three \nsignificant sub entities: A{“????”, ?????” }, \nP{“50???”} and R{“13????”}.Then we process A, \nP, R and extract attributes and attribute values respectively. \nWe extract place information from sub entity A, which \nconsists of the attributes and attribute values of \nprovince ,city and county\(include departure place and \ndestination place the 


type of the vehicle the type and quantity of the goods sub entity R, include the needs of \nvehicle\(the type of the vehicle the type and \nquantity of the goods entity S into several sub entities, which lay a \nfoundation of the future work. \nB. The P-R information extraction algorithm  based on \nAnnotation and word unit \nThere are two state in the P-R sub entities P and R n\(a b for vehicle \ninformation; \nWe use word unit to get the attributes and attribute \nvalues of the P-R entity [14 15] [16].The word unit of \nthe P-R entity is defined as follows: \nDefinition 1 : The word unit V\(vehicle the words \nthat indicate the vehicle information, such as “?”, “?” \nand so on, thus V={“?”, “?”}; \nDefinition 2 : The word unit G\(goods G={“?”, “?”}; \nWe deal with the P-R entity respectively, and the \nalgorithm is described as follows: \nStep 1 search and identify the category of the word \nunit; \nStep 2: according to the word unit to extract the \nOR$P A @ A \n?????????? 50????? 13??????????????? \n572\nattributes \(goods/vehicle numerical nvalue, show the type of vehicle / the quantity of goods structured data which are \nfrom the P-R entity; \nBecause the process of P is similar to the process of R, \nwe take the entity P as an example. The detail pseudo code \nof the algorithm is as follows: \nBegin \nInput P nLength  n; \nNum  0; \nProviderMark  0; \nfor i1 to n do \n{ \nGet the char Ci; \nIf Ci?V?G then \n{ \nIf Ci?V then MsgType ??; \nIf Ci?G then MsgType ??; \n} \nwhile 0?Ci?9or Ci=’.’ do \n{ \nNum=Num*10+Ci; \ni++ \n nProviderMark  Num; \n} \nOutput MsgType and ProviderMark; \nEnd \nC. The place names Extraction algorithm based on graph  \nWe intend to extract the attributes and attribute values \nof province, city and county \(include departure place and \ndestination place of logistics information, the sub \nentity before “@” may be the departure place, while the sub \nentity after should be the destination place. Because of \nthe particularity and generality of the users of the logistics \ninformation system,  they usually call those place for short \nand it is hardly to connect those place name with the words \nthat indicate places such as “?”, “?”, “?”, “?” [17]. \nThe idea of the algorithm that extracts the attributes \nand attribute values from the place sub entity A is as follows: \nwe make use of the char in the sub entity A to form a DAG \n\(directed acyclic graph as a vertex in DAG, and the relationship between \ntwo chars is shown as edge. We segment the DAG \naccording to the place dictionary. If the word which consists \ntwo vertexes is in the place dictionary, we merge the two nvertexes and the vertexes between the two vertexes, and \ndelete the vertexes and edges between the two vertexes. Do \nas what described above from the start vertex to the end \nvertex until we get the minimum edges 18] [19] [20] [21]. \nModel analysis: suppose that the place sub entity \nS=c1c2………cn. The ci?i=1,2,3,……,n? is a single char, \nand n\(n>=1 numbered as V1, V2, \nV3,……, Vn.  We build the edges using the below methods \n[19]: \n\(a Vk+1> between the adjacent \nvertex Vk and Vk+1. \n\(b edge <Vi,Vj+1> between vertexes Vi and \nVj+1, the vertexes Vi+1,……,Vj-1,Vj \(word \nW=ci+1……cj-1cj Vi. \nOn the basis of place dictionary [22] [23], when we get \nthe minimum edges \(minimum vertex we can \nextract the values of the vertex. The pseudo code for the \nalgorithm is as follows: \nBegin \nInput A nLength  n; \nLoad the place dictionary D; \ndo as above steps to set up DAG G; \nVertexNum  0; \nW  “”; \nFor i1 to n do \n{ \nGo through the vertex Vi in G ; \nWi=cici+1……cj-1cj; \n \nIf Wi?D  \n{ \nbuild the edge <Vi,Vj+1 between vertex Vi and \nVj+1;  \nvertex Vi+1,……,Vj-1,Vj \(word W=ci+1……cj-1cj information\(province/city/county destination \nplace\(province/city/county nattributes values of the place entity “??????->??\n????” is as follows:\n  \n\nFig.2. ?a?extract the place entity \n \n573\n \nFig.2. ?b?extract the place entity \n \nFig.2. ?c?extract the place entity \nIII. EXPERIMENT AND RESULT \nThe evaluation criterion of the structure process is that \nwe can extract the attributes and attribute values of the \nlogistics information entity, including departure province, \ndeparture city, departure county destination province, \ndestination city, destination county, message type \n\(vehicle/goods information \(the type of \nvehicle/goods the type of \nvehicle/goods these information, departure \nprovince, departure city, departure county, destination \nprovince, destination city, destination county, message type \n\(vehicle/goods typical information “?????\n?->??????, ? 40??, ? 13????, ???\n?” which is from logistics information system, the Chinese \nwords segment system ICTCLAS deals with the entity and \ngets the result “??/ns  ??/ns  ?/d  ?/n nx?\n?/ns  ??/nr  ??/ns  ,/w   ?/v  40/m  ?/q  ?\n/n  ,/w   ?/v  13/m  ?/q  ?/m  ??/n  ,/w   ?\n/n  ?/a  ?/ad

The structured result is as \nfollows nTABLE II.

The ICTCLAS cannot handle the un-login words \nwell. However the method proposed in this paper can \nrecognize these places’ names correctly. \nTo evaluate the efficiency of our method, we randomly \nselect 350 among more than 100 million logistics \ninformation from the logistics information system, and then \nwe use our method to process these data compared with \nICTCLAS. The results are shown in table 3 and figure 3:\nTABLE III.

The efficiency of two kinds of information extracting method \nThe figure data illuminates and compares the \nefficiency of the method proposed in this paper and \nICTCLAS. We can see that in the process of recognition of \nprovinces, those two methods have the same efficiency. \nWhile dealing with the recognition of county, message type \nand provider mark, our method has some advantages. \nBecause of the particularity and generality of the users of \nthe logistics information system, the information in logistics ninformation system is various and lack of normalization. All \nthese features lead to the result that the system ICTCLAS \ncannot correctly recognize the properties province, city and \ncounty in some cases as there are blank spaces in the words. \nWhat’s more, the system of ICTCLAS not only cannot \nrecognize the un-login words but also cannot pick out the \ndeparture place and the destination place. So the system \nICTCLAS is universal but not special; while our method \ncan recognize the departure place and the destination nplace\(province/city/county proposed in \nthis paper is more efficient. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nIn this paper, we study how to extract the attributes and \nattributes’ values of the non-structured logistics information \nentity by making use of the idea divide-and-conquer and \nheuristic tagging method. The results show that we can get \nattributes \(province city, county, message type heuristic method correctly. The method show \ngood performance when dealing with logistics information, \nand is significant to put into practice. We will improve our \nmethod in the future work and devote to the deeper research \non the algorithm of logistics capacity matching. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThis work was supported by "the Fundamental \nResearch Funds for the Central Universities" under grand \nNo. 2013-ZY-094, “National Natural Science Foundation of \nChina” under grand No. 51179146 and “Natural Science \nFoundation of Hubei Province under grand No. \n2011CDB254. \n \nREFERENCE \n[1] Daojian Zeng,Siwei Lai,Yuanzhe Zhang,Kang Liu, and Jun Zhao n“Open entity attribute-value extraction from unstructured text”, \nJournal of Jiangxi Normal University\(Natural Science Edition  http://baike.baidu.com/view/1133937.htm \n[3] Jinhua Hu,Yunfa Hu,Yiqun Zhou, and Aihua Xu, “Information nextracting mechanism of Chinese text database oriented”, Journal of \nChinese Computer Systems, Vol. 23, No 10, pp.1161-1164, Oct. \n2002. \n[4] Yan Huo, “The information extraction of unstructured document \nextraction and analysis”, Research Institute of Tianjin University, \n2011. \n[5] Qian Liu, Hui Jiao, and Huibo Jia Research on approaches of \ninformation extraction system”, Application Research of Computers, \nVol. 24, No 7, pp. 6-9, July, 2007. \n[6] Jun Yang, “Research and implementation of the unstructured data \ninformation extraction”, Wuhan Research and Institute of Post and \nTelecommunications , 2009. \n[7] He Hu, Xiaoyong Du Radical features for Chinese text \nclassification”, 9th International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and nKnowledge Discovery, 2012. \n[8] Yan Zhang, Mingyan Jiang, “Chinese text mining based on subspace nclustering”, 7th International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and \nKnowledge Discovery, 2010. \n[9] Jiana Bao Tingyu Li, Tianfang Yao, “Event information extraction \napproach based on complex Chinese texts 2012International \nConference on Asian Language Processing. \n[10] Hui Jiao, Qian Liu, Huibo Jia, “Chinese keyword extraction based on \nN-gram and word co-occurrence”, 2007 International Conference on \nComputational Intelligence and Security Workshops. \n[11] Huaping Zhang, Qun Liu, Hao Zhang, Xueqi Cheng, “Automatic nrecognition of Chinese unknown words recognition”, First SI GHAN \nWorkshop Attached with the l9th COLING Taipei,2002. \n4.2\n4.3\n4.4\n4.5\n4.6\n4.7\n4.8\n4.9\n5\n5.1\nPROVINCE CITY COUNTY MESSAGE \nTYPE\nPROVIDER \nMARK\nREQUIRE nMARK\nOUR METHOD\nICTCLAS\n575\n[12] Huaping Zhang, Qun Liu. “Automatic recognition of Chinese \npersonal name based on role tagging”, CHINESE JOURNAL OF \nCOMPUTERS\(CHINESE EDITION n[13] Lixia Wang, Xiaoyong Huai, “Semantic-based keyword extraction \nalgorithm for Chinese text”, Computer

nThe client process contained a loop that dispatched a task to \nthe manager for each month. The GRE manager used round \nrobin task placement to place each mean calculation on a single \nnode, and wrapped around the available resources. Our \nperformance metrics involved an average between five timings \nof the execution of the entire yearly workload from the client \nusing the Unix time command. \nFig. 7 represents the scaling of the GRE system on the \nannual mean benchmark for up to 9 compute nodes. The x-\naxis is the number of nodes performing the concurrent \nexecution of the benchmark, and the y-axis is the total \nworkload runtime in seconds. The ideal curve demonstrates \nperfectly linear scaling. Our measurements show very good \nscaling which is expected due to the simple parallelism \n2163\ninherent in the data and computational layout. However our \nmeasurements show performance flattens out after five nodes, \nthis is due to bandwidth saturation for NFS. For GB Ethernet \nthis is around 120 MB/s, which is reached when using 5 nodes n120MB/s=\(\(360*200 months, we had \nmore than 2 jobs running on each node for experiments run \nbelow 6 nodes. \n \nFig. 7.

CONCLUSION \n We present Gridderama, a statistical aggregation engine \nfor large structured data records that is designed for out of the \nbox compatibility with geoscience datasets.  Further our case \nstudy and specific workflow implementation enable climate \ntrending analysis of a 55 Terabyte decadal record of Outgoing nLongwave Spectrum \(OLS AIRS nGridderama is its handling of hierarchical directory structures \nas a “Data Cube” representation for statistical aggregations. \nThese aggregations can be executed in parallel with good \nscalability using the GRE runtime environment.  One of the \nlimitations of Gridderama is its requirement for IO Bandwidth \nto and from the filesystem and we were limited in our results \nby Gigabit Ethernet.  As a future direction we plan to nexperiment with the scalability on clusters/clouds with faster \ninterconnect to IO.  Finally, we would like to extend \nGridderama to a few more of the many highly structured \nscientific instrument records that adhere to the ”Data cube” \ntopology. \nREFERENCES \n \n[1] Moreau, Luc, Ben Clifford, Juliana Freire, Joe Futrelle Yolanda Gil, \nPaul Groth, Natalia Kwasnikowska et al.

Codeword buffering delay – we assume the \ncodeword frame synchronization mechanism will \nrequire 3 code frames to acquire and to confirm \nframe sync.  Let R denote the data rate.  Thus the \ncodeword buffering delay for DSN missions and \nSN/NEN missions are 3x2048/R and 3x4500/R \nrespectively \(in unit of seconds 


Frame buffering delay – we assume a Space Link \nExtension \(SLE acquired and confirmed in one frame.  \nThus the frame buffering delay is 10240/R \(in unit \nof seconds Ground transmission delay – from prior statistics \nfor DSN data delivery over the NISN lines, we \nobserve that the long-haul latency between DSN \nsites and JPL Central is approximately 2 times the \npropagation delay.  As ground transmission latency \nis a small fraction compared to the other delays, we \nuse the rough estimation of two times propagation \ndelay to model the ground transmission delay.   \n \nUsing the Straight-Forward Leveling Scheme we estimate \nthe link sizes of the network paths of the four ISE options \nfor the “base” case and high” case traffic scenarios, both \nfor bulk science latency requirements of 1 hour and 8 hours nrespectively.  The aggregated WAN bandwidths of the four \nISE options for both cases are given in Tables 1 and 2.   \n \n \nTable 1: Aggregated WAN Bandwidths \(Gbps Straight-Forward \nLeveling Scheme \n \n \nTable 2: Aggregated WAN Bandwidths \(Gbps Eight Hours, Straight-Forward \nLeveling Scheme \n \nSimilarly we apply the 2-State Markov Leveling Scheme, \nand the aggregated WAN bandwidths of the four ISE \noptions for the base and high cases are given in Table 3 \n\(with bulk science latency of 1 hour with bulk \nscience latency of 8 hours Aggregated WAN Bandwidths \(Gbps nTable 4: Aggregated WAN Bandwidths \(Gbps Scheme \n \nTo validate the accuracy of the leveling schemes, we choose \nthe DSN’s GSS-MOC links for the ISE option-1 for the case \nwhen the bulk science latency requirement is one hour, and \ncompare the bandwidth estimates generated by the Straight-\nForward Leveling Scheme and those generated by direct \nsimulation using MACHETE10.

All other links are store-and-forward links, and the \nlink sizes are driven by the combined effects of nmission data rates, data types with different latency \nrequirements, and duty cycles.   \n3. For ISE-3 and ISE-4, the aggregated WAN \nbandwidths are insensitive to data type latency \nrequirements as their WAN bandwidths are \ndominated by the real-time GSS-INOC links.   \n4. For ISE-4 with two different bulk science latency \nrequirements, the aggregated WAN bandwidths for \nthe high-case are only 20% higher than those of the nnominal case.  This is because the ISE-4 WAN \nbandwidths are dominated by GSS-INOC links that \ntransport RF/IF samples, and are independent of \nthe data rates.   \n5. For ISE-3, ISE-4, and ISE-5, the aggregated WAN nbandwidths of the “high” case are approximately \nthree times as those of the “base” case.  This is nconsistent with the fact that the “high” case \nconsists of future mission data rates that are 3 times \nthose of the “base” case.   \n6. The WAN bandwidths of ISE-3 and ISE-4 are \nmuch higher than those of ISE-1 and ISE-2.   \n \n \nV. CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE WORK \n \nIn this paper, we describe new leveling schemes to model \nthe traffic flow and buffering mechanism of a large-scale \nstore-and-forward network.  We apply these techniques to \nestimate the wide area network \(WAN options of the \nproposed Integrated Space Communication and Navigation \n\(ScaN improve the fidelity \nof the leveling schemes and enhance the INA Study are as \nfollows:   \n1. Use statistical description to define link bandwidth \nrequirements.  The current analysis uses the min-\nmax approach to estimate the link sizes of a \nnetwork as described in Section 4.  A better \napproach to quantify the link sizes is to describe \nthe individual link size in terms of mean and \nvariance based on the simulated traffic that flows \nthrough the link.  By invoking the Gaussian \nassumption and using the 2nd order statistics ngathered from the traffic flow simulation, one can \nspecify the link sizes based on the statistical nconfidence level to prevent overflow.   \n2. Provide data type modeling for each individual \nmission.  The current analysis makes blanket \nassumptions on mission data types across all the \nmissions as described in 


Section 4.  When data \ntype allocation information is available for an \nindividual mission, we can implement the specific \ndata type allocation for that particular mission to \nimprove the simulation fidelity.   \n3 Include other latency contributions.  The current \nanalysis only models the store-and-forward delay \nbased on the latency requirements of the data types, \nwhich accounts for the majority of the latency in \nthe data delivery operation.  We can improve the \naccuracy of the analysis by modeling the additional \nlatency contribution of codeword buffering delay, \nframe buffering delay, and ground transmission \ndelay as described in Section 4.   \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \nThe authors would like to thank John Segui for his \nengineering and simulation support, and Loren Clare for his \ninsightful comments.

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
