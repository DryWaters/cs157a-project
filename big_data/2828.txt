method  uses  a  compact  image  signature  which  depends  on  image  content  and  is  invariant  to  many  widely  used  image  processing  techni q ues  such  as  lossy  compression  resizing  resampling  color  enhancements  and  simple  rotations  The  signature  is  designed  to  be  usable  in  big  image  database  it  has  small  size  a  few  dozen  bytes    the  e x traction  is  fast  and  the  comparison  of  image  signatures  is  very  fast  More  than  milion  of  image  signatures  per  second  can  be  compared  on  a  modern  PC  Usage  of  the  method  within  a  framework  for  Digital  Rights  Infringements  Detection  in  the  World  Wide  Web  is  also  discussed   Keywords Still  image  duplicate  detection  image  signature  search  and  retrieval

data  is  often  modified  during  the  distribution  to  meet v arious  re q uirements  of  networks  storage  capacity  or  capabilities  of  user  e q uipment  Different  multimedia  de v ices  and  networks  often  need  data  in  specific  formats  bitrates  and  resolutions    so  the  data  must  be  transformed  according  to  these  needs   e  g  different  format  is  preferred  by  high  resolution  printers H D  displays P C  monitors  and  mobile  phones   This  makes  the  possibility  that  the  same  material  is  stored  and  distributed  in  modified v ersions  and v arious  formats  The  e x amples  of  modifications  which  may  be  applied  to v isual  data  are  rescaling  lossy  compression  changing  of  color  depth  and  image  enhancements  such  as  changing  brightness  saturation  blurring  or  sharpening   The  goal  of  copy  detection  systems  is  to  allow  the  detection  and  localization  of  all v ariants  of  the  same  multimedia  material  including  the  modified  v ersions  The  detection  should  be  fast  reliable  and  robust  to  widely  used  techni q ues  of  adaptation  or  enhancement  of  the  material   In  this  paper  a  techni q ue  for  still  image  copy  detection  is  presented  A  practical  application  of  this  techni q ue  may  be  for  e x ample  an  image  copyright  protection  system  which  uses  image  copy  detection  module  for  searching  copies  of  copyrighted  images  in  public  networks  A nother  e x ample  is  an  application  of  digital  photo  management  Many  users  of  digital  cameras  often  process  their  photos  in  popular  image  processing  applications  and  multiple   modified   copies  of  the  same  photo  may  be  stored  in  their  photo  galleries  Copy  detection  tool  would  allow  users  to  find  photos  ha v ing  different v ersions  in  their  pri v ate  photo  galleries   A  number  of  papers  in v estigated  the  problem  of  still  image  copy  detection  Some  of  them  proposed  techni q ues  which  utilize v arious v isual  features  such  as  color  shape  or  te x ture  1    2   3   O ther  methods  use  interest  points  to  inde x  local  features  4 These  methods  usually  produce  big  descriptions  and  the  searching  speed  is  q uite  slow  as  they  use  comple x  distance  functions  for  comparing  image  features  To  be  usable  for  big  image  repositories  containing  millions  of  images  the  application  of  image  replica  detection  should  pro v ide    fast  feature  e x traction  algorithm    small  size  of  image  feature  used  for  image  description    fast  search  algorithm   calculation  of  the  distance  between  image  features     high  precision  and  recall   Recently  the  possibility  of  designing  a v isual  identifier  which  can  be  used  for  image  replica  detection  was  also  in v estigated  by  standardization  acti v ities  of  M PE G  group  They  defined  re q uirements  for  image  signature  which  can  be  used  for  content based  image  identification  These  re q uirements  contain  e x perimental  conditions  for  two  different  scenarios  fast  algorithm  with  high  success  rate  for  replicas  obtained  by  basic  modifications  and  possibly  slower  algorithm  which  will  detect  image  replicas  obtained  by  hea v y  modifications  Two  contributions  which  fulfill  the  re q uirement  of  basic  image  signature  ha v e  been  submitted  O ne  contribution  use  Radon  transform 6 to  compute  features  in v ariant  to  basic  image  operations  and  the  second  contribution  proposes  a  method  based  on  features  computed  in  concentric  circle  regions 7 455 


50 th International Symposium ELMAR-2008, 10-12 September 2008, Zadar, Croatia   The  work  presented  in  this  paper  proposes  another  algorithm  which  fulfils  the  re q uirements  of  M PE G  image  signature  for  basic  modifications  described  in   which  can  be  used  for  fast  searching  of  image  replicas  in  big  databases  The  detection  rate  and  performance  of  the  proposed  image  signature  is  e v aluated  according  to  the  e v aluation  criteria  described  in  that  document   The  techni q ue  presented  in  this  paper  is  an  e x tension  of  the  work  presented  in  where  image  is  partitioned  into  fi x ed  number  of  s q uare  blocks  The  blocks  can  be  o v erlapped  or  not  In  each  block  a  local  feature  is  computed  and  the  successi v e  blocks  form  tra j ectory  of  features  Singular  energies  were  used  as  features  of  the  blocks  The  tra j ectories  form  a v ector  of  features  and  the  correlation  of v ectors  between  original  image  and  modified  copies  are v ery  high  so  the  correlation  of  the  feature  tra j ectories  was  used  to  obtain  the  similarity  of  two  images  The  main  impro v ement  of  the  method  presented  in  this  paper  is  that  the  list  of  in v ariant  image  modifications  is  e x tended  by  basic  rotations   90   1 80   2 70   flip  horizontally  and v ertically   A lso  some  new  concepts  for  e x tracting  the  image  signature  are  introduced  and  e v aluated  A s  a  result  the  signature  has  smaller  size  and  the  detection  rate  is  better   The  outline  of  the  paper  is  the  following  In  section  2  the  algorithms  for  e x traction  and  matching  of  image  signature  are  described E x periments  and  results  are  presented  in  section 3 In  section 4 the  application  of  replica  detection  module  within  the  framework  for  digital  rights  infringement  detection  system  is  described  Section 5 concludes  the  paper    2  IMAG E SIG N AT U R E   2  1   E x traction   The  signature  obtained  by  the  proposed  e x traction  algorithm  is  in v ariant  to  many  common  image  processing  techni q ues  The  signature  can  be  used  to  detect  replicas  created  by  color  con v ersions  enhancements  resizing  simple  rotation  lossy  compression  and  applying  filters   The  e x traction  algorithm  can  be  described  by  the  following  steps  1   Image  preprocessing    resize  image  in  such  a  way  the  shorter  edge  has  2 56 pi x els    con v ert  the  pi x el v alues  of  image  to  grayscale    crop  the  central  part  of  the  image  of  the  size  2 56  2 56 pi x els  2   P artition  image  into  o v erlapping  blocks  B  x  y   of  the  size  1 6  1 6 The  blocks  are  obtained  by  mo v ing  window  1 6  1 6 across  the  image  from  left  to  right  by 8 pi x els  and  ne x t  from  top  to  bottom  also  by 8 pi x els   x  y 0  8   1 6   2 4  3 2  40   3  Compute  features  in  each  local  block   3 features  are  used  mean  le v el  of  luminance  Y\(x   y    mean  energy  of  a  block  E x y  and  singular  energy  of  a  block  S x y  which  is  defined  as  fractional  distribution  of  the  energy  in  first  singular  channel  defined  by  singular  directions  of  image  blocks   4  Cluster  image  blocks  to  obtain  block  groups  which  are  rotation in v ariant  Rotation  in v ariant  means  that  when  the  image  is  rotated   basic  rotations   the  group  is  not  changed  5  Compute  features  for  each  group  of  blocks  mean  of  feature v alues  and  standard  de v iation  of  features  in  the  groups Y mean  i    Y de v  i    E mean  i    E de v  i    S mean  i    S de v  i    where  i  is  the  id  of  group  of  blocks 0   i  12 0 6  Build  image  signature  the  signature  is  a  bit string  built  from  the  feature v alues  The  signature  bits  are  computed  for  each  feature  F if   F  i  1    F  i   Signature  i   1  else  Signature  i  0   where F is  one  of  features Y mean  Y de v   E mean   E de v   S mean   S de v  The  resulting  signature  is  a  concatenation  of  bit streams  obtained  for  a  chosen  set  of  features  the  ma x imum  size  of  the  signature  if  all  the  features  are  used  is 6 11 9 = 7 1 4 bits     F ig  1   Illustration  of  image  preprocessing  and  partitioning  into  blocks  456

signatures  can  be  e x tracted  and  stored  To  check  if  a  gi v en  image  is  a  replica  of  any  of  the  images  in  the  database  first  signature  of  the  test  image  is  e x tracted  and  ne x t  it  is  matched  to  all  the  signatures  of  the  images  in  the  database   The  matching  algorithm  compares  bit streams  of  two  signatures  and  the  distance  is  the H amming  distance  which  means  the  number  of  bits  which  differ  in  the  two  signatures  This  can  be  implemented v ery  efficiently    a  few  millions  of  comparisons  per  second  can  be  performed  The  final  decision  to  classify  two  images  as  replicas  is  made  by  comparing  the  computed  distance  with  a  distance  threshold  The  threshold  is  determined  e x

In the ideal amplifier case both the BPSK and 12-4 QAM meet the ACI mask with OBO=3 dB The hump in the BPSK lobe is the result of it being statistically more likely to have a zero-crossing in BPSK modulation than 12-4 QAM In addition an OBO of 3 dB is similar to IPAPR95 implying that IPAPR95 may be a reasonable offset factor between linear and saturated EIRP The second case of study is simulation of memory-less nonlinear models such as AM-AM and AM-PM The manufacturers provided large-signal measurement-based AM-AM and AM-PM models of SSPAs A and B to simulate using the LLAT software The spectral re-growth of these models shown in Figure 5\(a and Figure 6\(a shows the onset of spectral re-growth much earlier than the ideal amplifier case Since SSPAs A and B have different AM-AM characteristics shown as power compression curves in Figure 1 and Figure 2 the re-growth characteristics are also different between the two models shown in Figure 5\(a and Figure 6\(a for SSPA A and Figure 7\(a and Figure 8\(a for SSPA B Although the memory-less non-linear models show larger re-growth than the ideal amplifier model for both BPSK and 12-4 QAM they provide an optimistic expectation of only a few dB OBO requirement for most spectral masks The third case of study is a measurement of the two SSPA devices using LLAT Each device is characterized using BPSK and 12-4 QAM waveforms at 3.75 and 15 Msps In the case of SSPA A the device without significant memory effects BPSK modulation at the two data rates shown in Figure 5\(b and Figure 5\(c match closely with the model simulation in Figure 5\(a A degradation of a few dB in spectral re-growth is observed when comparing the measured data and the model The measurements also match closely with the model for 12-4 QAM shown in Figure 6\(b and Figure 6\(c 5 CONCLUSION During the early planning and design phase of a SATCOM terminal it is important to predict the expected radiated power from a transmitting amplifier This is especially true for small mobile terminals where size weight and power are at a premium Under these conditions the transmitting amplifiers must be optimized for power efficiency and linearity Understanding how the non-linear effects of an amplifier distort a waveform is a difficult task especially when limited to single-tone data Simulations show that a few dB of OBO is required to meet an ACI mask of 30 dBc even with in an ideal power-limited amplifier IPAPR95 of a waveform is a reasonable estimate for required OBO Measurements indicate that it is possible to realize Q-band solid-state amplifiers that approximate an ideal power-limited amplifier however care must be taken not to add memory into the device when optimizing it for high-power and high-efficiency performance Future work will investigate the limitations of two-tone measurements in predicting distortion since two-tone waveforms have a limited PAPR 5 LLAT is capable of fully interrogating an amplifier in order to develop highfidelity behavioral models 6 7 Ongoing work aims to understand how millimeter-wave solid-state and travelingwave tube amplifier distortions relate to ACI EVM and BER as data rate increases However SSPA B which has strong memory presents two effects The first is degradation in spectral re-growth in the first side-band region of 5 to 10 dB for the lower data rate shown in Figure 7\(b for BPSK and Figure 8\(b for 12-4 QAM The higher data rate has 10 to 15 dB degradation in the first side band shown in Figure 7\(c and Figure 8\(c The second effect is the asymmetry in the re-growth between the highand low-side bands The memory-less non-linear model based on single-tone measurements of SSPA B does not make any predictions of side-band asymmetry The strong memory in SSPA B was determined to be the result of bias circuitry originally designed for maximum power and efficiency using single-tone measurements Modifications to the bias network improved the performance and significantly reduced the memory effects 6

Sensitive volume for earth orbiting spacecraft which transit thr ough the Van Allen belts is negligible compared to trapped protons. Most of the data presented used 150 mil shielding as indicated in Table 4  When other thicknesses, ranging from 150 mils to 400 mils were explored as shown in Table 5 less than a 17% change was observed in the predicted upset rate.  A minor difference between the observed and the predicted number of upsets for the majority of the programs analyzed indicates that the models are relatively accurate in predicting upset rates even after the SV and shielding assumptions were explored.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
