They can be effectively used\nto represent social networks, web search engines and genome\nsequencing. The field of graph pattern matching has been\nof significant importance and has wide-spread applications.\nConceptually, we want to find subgraphs that match a pattern\nin a given graph. Much work has been done in this field with\nsolutions like Subgraph Isomorphism and Regular Expression\nmatching. With Big Data, scientists are frequently running into\nmassive graphs that have amplified the challenge that this area\nposes. We study the speedup and communication behavior of\nthree distributed algorithms for inexact graph pattern match-\ning.

INTRODUCTION\nGraphs are of utmost importance in Computer Science\nbecause of their expressivity and the ability to abstract\na huge class of problems. They have been successfully\nused to study and model numerous problems in different\nfields. These applications vary from software plagiarism\ndetection, web search engines, study of molecular bonds to\nthe modeling of social networks like Facebook, LinkedIn\nand Twitter [1].\nGraph pattern matching is one of the most important and\nwidely studied class of problems in graphs. A considerable\namount of research has been put into this area sprouting\nconcepts like Subgraph Isomorphism, Regular Expression\nmatching [2] and Graph Simulation [3 Conceptually, pat-\ntern matching algorithms seek to find subgraphs of a given\ngraph that are similar to the given query graph [4]. Though,\nSubgraph Isomorphism returns the strictest matches for\ngraph matching in terms of topology [5], the problem is\nNP-complete [6], and thus does not scale well.\nGraph simulation, on the other hand, provides a prac-\ntical alternative to subgraph isomorphism by relaxing the\nstringent matching conditions of subgraph isomorphism, and\nallowing matches to be found in polynomial time. Some\nresearchers [7], [8] even argue that graph simulation is\nmore appropriate than subgraph isomorphism for modern\nproblems like social network analysis because it yields\nmatches that are conceptually more meaningful. With the\nrapid advent of Big Data, graphs have transformed into huge\nsizes and are rapidly getting out of the grasp of conventional\ncomputational approaches. In this paper, we address the\nproblem of graph pattern matching on such big graphs.\nThe outline of the paper is as follows: We discuss\nthe background and a description of the subgraph pattern\nmatching problem along with its types in next section. We\nfollow-up with a brief description of three new distributed\nalgorithms that we proposed in [4]. Then we go through the\nimplementation of distributed algorithms on two platforms\nand briefly compare their pros and cons. We also give run-\ntime and speed-up graphs of the three distributed algorithms\nto study their behavior. In section 6, we study the impact\nof graph partitioning along two lines - runtime improvement\nand network I/O reduction.\nII BACKGROUND\nIn this section, we discuss the background and give\nmotivation for the need of new approaches to deal with large\nscale graphs in general and query processing in particular.\nToday, Facebook has over 1 billion vertices and the average\ndegree of each vertex is 1401, Twitter has well over 200\nmillion active users creating over 400 million tweets each\nday2. In genome sequencing, recent work [9] attempts to\nsolve the genome assembly problem by traversing the de\nBrujin graph of the read sequence. The de Brujin graph can\ncontain as many as 4k vertices where k is atleast 20.\nTo handle the mammoth scale of these graphs, an obvious\napproach is to distribute the graphs onto multiple machines\nand then run them concurrently to efficiently calculate the\nresult in parallel. Consequently some of the basic challenges\nare the following, \(1 graph? \(2 3 the communication/traffic\namong different machines \(in part, a side effect of the top\ntwo these questions as we discuss the\nproblem of Subgraph Pattern Matching in depth.\n1http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?statistics\n2http://blog.twitter.com\n2013 IEEE International Congress on Big Data\n978-0-7695-5006-0/13 $26.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/BigData.Congress.2013.78\n255\nA Subgraph Pattern Matching\nThe problem of subgraph matching is defined as follows:\nLet G=\(V, E, l where V is the set of vertices,\nE is the set of edges, and l is the labelling function that\nassigns a label to each vertex in V. Let Q=\(Vq , Eq , lq pattern set of edges and lq is the labeling function on Vq .\nIntuitively, the goal of subgraph pattern matching is to find\nall subgraphs from the data graph G that match the pattern\ngraph Q. Thus, G?\(V ?, E?, l of G if and only\nif \(1 2 3 u u generality we assume all\nvertices are labeled, all edges are directed, and there are\nno multiple edges. We 


also assume a query graph is a\nconnected graph because the result of pattern matching for a\ndisconnected query graph is equal to the union of the results\nfor its connected components. We use the terms pattern and\nquery graph interchangeably.\nB. Types of Pattern Matching\nIn this section, we briefly review four different types of\npattern matching. The first one is Subgraph Isomorphism,\nthe next one is Graph Simulation proposed in [3 and the\nlast two are Dual and Strong Simulation proposed in [10].\nFor a detailed survey of algorithms, see 11].\n1 pattern\nmatching. By definition, subgraph isomorphism describes a\nbijective mapping between a query graph Q\(Vq, Eq, lq V,E, l V ?, E subgraph of G, graph Q\nwill be subgraph isomorphic to G if there is a bijective\nfunction f from the vertices of Q to the vertices of G?\nsuch that \(u, v f\(u v  It should be noted that function f\nensures that u and f\(u algorithm [13] are widely known to solve\nthe problem of subgraph isomorphism [11]. However, this\nproblem is NP-hard in general so exact algorithms are not\npractical for very large graphs.\n2 simulation allows a faster al-\nternative to subgraph isomorphism by relaxing some restric-\ntions. Pattern Q\(Vq, Eq, lq V,E, l relation R ? Vq × V such that \(1 u, u 2 u equals\nl\(u 3 u v, v u adapted from [10 Here, child returns\nall the direct children of a given vertex.\nIntuitively, graph simulation only captures the child rela-\ntionships of vertices. HHK - a quadratic algorithm, was first\nproposed in [3] and efficiently computes the match set on\nmedium-sized graphs, but it is still not efficient enough for\nmassive graphs.\n3 Dual Simulation: Dual simulation extends graph sim-\nulation by also taking into account the parent relationships\nof the vertices, thus resulting in a stricter match set. Pattern\nQ\(Vq, Eq, lq graph G\(V,E, l 1 match relation RD ? Vq × V , and \(2 u w,w w adapted from [10 Strong simulation builds on dual\nsimulation by introducing a locality condition. The term\nball is coined [10 to capture this aspect of the match. The\nball for a vertex v with radius r contains all the vertices\nVB that are within an undirected distance of r from the\nvertex v, moreover it has all the edges between those vertices\nVB and no more. Pattern Q\(Vq, Eq, lq V,E, l Q Ssim G, if\nthere exists a vertex v ?

Models of Computation\nWith the advent of Big Data computing computational\nmodels for graph algorithms have been re-examined. Over\nthe years, a number of ideas have been proposed for effi-\ncient and scalable processing of graphs. Since this paper is\nfocussed on big graphs, we only go through some of the\nmost important distributed models.\n1 using MPI\n\(Message Passing Interface processing like Parallel\nBGL [14] and CGMgraph [15]. However, these libraries do\nnot support fault tolerance or some other issues that are\nimportant for very large scale distributed systems.\n2 introduced a system based on\nMapReduce model for the processing large data sets [16].\nIt provides fault tolerance and ease of programming; hence,\nsome scientists have implemented their parallel graph pro-\ncessing package over the MapReduce platform like Pegasus\n[17] that is developed for some graph mining algorithms.\nHowever, this model is inherently unsuitable for an iterative\nalgorithm which is the case for most of graph algorithms.\n3 BSP 18] as a computation\nmodel for parallel processing. As it is illustrated in figure\n1, computation in this model is a series of supersteps.\nEach superstep contains three ordered stages: \(1 where different processes run concurrently; \(2 3 to\n256\nthe next superstep. In the vertex-centric programming model,\neach vertex of the data graph is a computing unit which can\nbe conceptually mapped to a process in the BSP model.\nFigure 1: An example for BSP model\nGoogle presented Pregel [19] based on Vertex-centric BSP\nmodel for processing very large graphs. A few other open\nsource projects are also introduced that have a similar idea,\nnamely GPS \(Graph Processing System 20], Apache Gi-\nraph3, Apache Hama4, and Signal/Collect in its synchronous\nmode [21].\n4 Asynchronous: Although implementing\na system based on BSP model makes the system inherently\nfree of any 


deadlock, but its synchronization stage can\nintroduce a bottleneck because in each superstep all the\nworkers should wait for the slowest one. Therefore, there\nare a few other systems that follow the idea of vertex-\ncentric asynchronous model; i.e., they enjoy benefits of a\nvertex-centric model, but avoid bottlenecks of BSP model.\nExamples are GraphLab [22] and Signal/Collect in its asyn-\nchronous mode [21].\nD. Graph Partitioning\nGraph partitioning has extensive applications in many\nareas including telephone network design VLSI design and\ntask scheduling. The problem is to partition the graph into p\nroughly equal parts, such that number of edges connecting\nvertices in different parts is minimized [23].\nIt is important in the context of distributed computing\nbecause we want to partition the graph into pieces such that\neach piece is mostly self-contained; i.e., we want to reduce\nits communication to other parts as much as possible, thus\nin theory resulting in speed-up. However, it is not a trivial\nproblem. When we partition the graph, we need to take care\nof two points:\n1 fair amount of\nload.\n2 Giraph: http://incubator.apache.org/giraph/\n4Apache Hama: http://hama.apache.org/\nWe term the partitioning that enforces the two conditions\nlisted above as min-cut partitioning. It is an NP-complete\nproblem and has been extensively studied in its own right.\nIt has been successfully used with considerable improvement\nin various applications. It must be noted that graph partition-\ning has no guarantees to provide consistent improvements\nfor all graph algorithms. It will result in good speed-up,\nif the communication is mostly between adjacent vertices,\nsince partitioning tries to co-locate them in a single partition;\nhowever, if that is not the case then communication is\ninevitable. Semih [20] was able to achieve 2.2x improvement\nin speed by adding min-cut partitioning to the PageRank\nalgorithm, but in the case of Highly-Connected Component,\nSingle Source Shortest Path the speed-up was only 1.47 and\n1.08, respectively.\nIII. DISTRIBUTED ALGORITHMS FOR GRAPH DUAL\nAND STRONG SIMULATION\nIn this section, we give an outline of distributed algorithms\nfor graph, dual and strong simulation that are designed\nfor a vertex-centric system. Our implementation of strong\nsimulation is an optimized version of the original strong\nsimulation.\nGraph Simulation: In the designed distributed algorithm\nfor graph simulation, the query graph is distributed among\nall vertices of the data graph, and then each vertex should\nfind out its match set among the vertices of the query graph.\nVertex u? of the data graph matches to vertex u of the query\ngraph if the two vertices have the same label, and each child\nof u has at least one match among the children of u?.\nIn a vertex-centric system, a vertex initially knows only\nabout its own label and the id of its children. Therefore,\neach vertex needs to communicate with its neighbors to learn\nabout their labels and status in order to evaluate the child-\nrelationship condition. A Boolean flag called match flag, is\ndedicated to each vertex which indicates if the vertex has a\npotential match among the vertices of the query graph. This\nflag is initially false.\nIn an example displayed in figure 2, all the vertices of\nthe data graph labeled a, b, and c make their flag true at the\nfirst superstep, and then vertices 1, 2, and 5 send messages\nto their children. At the second superstep only vertices 5, 6,\nand 7 will reply back to their parents. At the third superstep,\nvertices 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 can successfully validate their match\nset, but vertex 2 makes its flag false, because it receives no\nmessage from any child. Therefore, vertex 2 sends a removal\nmessage to vertex 1. This message will be received by vertex\n1 at superstep four. It will successfully reevaluate its match\nset, and the algorithm will finish at superstep five when every\nvertex has voted to halt \(there is no further communication similar to graph Simulation. In addition to child-\nrelationship, we extend the algorithm to check parent-\nrelationship as well.\n257\nFigure 2: An example for distributed graph simulation\nStrong Simulation: A version of strong Simulation is done\nin two phases: \(1 then \(2 we\nrun dual simulation on each to compute the final output of\nstrong simulation.\nThe biggest challenge we faced in strong simulation was\nthe creation of balls. Because of the scale of graphs, we may\nend up creating balls for many of vertices simultaneously\nwhich could bog down the whole system. Therefore, we\ntried two different approaches that we go through below.\n1 process works in a depth-first fashion. In the first\nsuperstep, each vertex left after dual simulation performs\nas the center of a ball and sends messages to its adjacent\nvertices with the specified ball size. The receiving vertices\nreply back with their labels and forward the message to their\nadjacent vertices with a decremented ball size. This process\nis repeated and these messages are removed from the system\nwhen the ball size reaches zero. Since this approach is very\nslow and does not scale well, we have omitted its details,\nbut an explanation can be found at [24].\nFigure 3: A breadth-first ball around vertex X with dq = 2\n2 Breadth-First Ball: This approach works on a simple\nping-reply model. In figure 3, let us suppose we want 


to\ncreate a ball around vertex X of radius 2. Initially, X only\nknows its adjacent node ids 1,7 and no label information. It\nstarts off by sending a ping message to all of its adjacent\nnodes. In the second superstep all the recipient nodes reply\nback with their labels and the ids of their children and\nparents. Thus, in 3\(b X upon receiving these messages\nstores the gathered information about the vertices in its ball;\ne.g., labels and ids of its descendants and ascendants. In 3\(c vertices\n\(vertices at a distance 2 of the center children and parents,\nsubsequently saved by the node X in 3\(d results in almost\ntwice the number of supersteps, yet it is much more efficient\nand performs much better than the other approach, therefore\nwe adopted this approach for our strong simulation tests.\nIV. IMPLEMENTATION OF DISTRIBUTED ALGORITHMS\nIn this section, we implement graph simulation on two\ndifferent distributed computing infrastructures and compare\ntheir pros and cons.\nA. GPS - Graph Processing System\nAs mentioned above, because all of the algorithms were\ndesigned with a BSP and vertex-centric model, we decided\nto use something akin to Pregel for the implementation.\nOf the numerous options available, we picked GPS for our\nalgorithms since it offers everything that we desire of Pregel\nand is available as open-source. It is written in Java and also\ngives us an option to write a master.compute simulation.\nAs in Pregel, there are two types of main components in\nthe system: one master node and k worker nodes. A GPS\njob starts off by partitioning the data graph over all the\nparticipating workers. Every worker reads its partition and\nthen distributes the vertices based on a round-robin scheme,\ni.e., vertex v gets assigned to worker W = v.id % k. The\nlifecycle of a GPS job can be summarized in following steps:\n\(a the input graph files, \(b c voted\nto halt and there are no messages in transit, otherwise go to\n\(b for building highly concur-\nrent, distributed, and fault tolerant event driven applications\non the JVM. It has an extended API that lets you manage ser-\nvice failures, load management \(back-off strategies, timeouts\nand processing-isolation The\nAPI is available both in Java as well as Scala.\nC. GPS vs Akka\nGPS delivers on its promise of Pregel However, to enable\nthe message passing for the custom types requires substantial\neffort that is not only time-consuming, but is also prone to\nerrors. For example, if the message contains some complex\n5http://akka.io/\n258\n\(a b c 108, ? = 1.2\nFigure 4: Running times and speed-up for distributed algorithms, |Vq| = 25, ?q = 1.2\ntypes, we need to be very careful with how the message\nis serialized at the sending vertex and then deserialized at\nthe receiving end. Implementation detail of serializer and\ndeserializer can be cumbersome, hard to maintain and not\nso readable.\nAkka, unlike GPS is a general purpose toolkit for build-\ning highly concurrent and distributed applications and not\nsomething that is built ground-up only for graphs. It means\nthere is some work that needs to be done to make Akka\nwork in a fashion similar to BSP. Perhaps, the biggest edge\nthat Akka has over other comparable models is its inherent\nability and support for sending messages between actors.\nWith Akka, the developers do not have to worry about\nserializing/deserializing of data. They can send messages\nwrapping complex types with extremely concise and terse\nsyntax.\nFigure 5: GPS and Akka on Graph Simulation\nWe implemented a prototype application for Graph Simu-\nlation using Akka. We were surprised by the power and ease\nprovided by Akka for rapid development. Even with the most\nbasic implementation, we were able to achieve much better\ntimes as we were getting from a system like GPS. The tests\nwere conducted on the amazon-2008 [25] dataset and were\nrun over a cluster of 5 machines. As can be seen in Figure\n5, Akka ran almost twice as fast as GPS.\nV. EVALUATION OF DISTRIBUTED ALGORITHMS\nJust like any other distributed algorithm, speed-up and\nefficiency are of significant importance for the scalability of\nalgorithms discussed above. Here, we try to examine that\nbehavior by varying the number of workers and how the\nalgorithms react.\nA Experimental Setup\nWe have used both synthesized and real-world graphs in\nour experiments. Having the number of vertices, the number\nof edges in a synthesized data graph is determined by ? such\nthat |E| = |V |?. To study the consistency of results, we ran\nthe experiments for three different datasets - one synthesized\n\(|V 108, ? = 1.2  uk-2005 has 39459925 vertices and 936364282\nedges whereas enwiki-2013 is relatively smaller but more\ndense, with 4206785 vertices and 101355853 edges mentioned otherwise\nis kept constant at 1.2. To retrieve a query graph for a\nparticular data set, we took |Vq as the input which is the\nsize of query graph. Then we randomly extract a connected\nsubgraph from the dataset that adheres to the ?q constraint\nand has |Vq| number of vertices.\nThe experiments were conducted using GPS on a cluster\nof 12 machines. Each one has a 128GB DDR3 RAM, two\n2GHz Intel Xeon E5-2620 CPUs, each with 6 cores 


The\nethernet connection is 1Gb. In case of more than 11 workers,\nwe assigned multiple workers to the same worker node in a\nround-robin fashion.\nB. Experimental Results\nWe give the graphs for running times and speed-up in\nfigure 4. It is clear that all three algorithms exhibit scalable\nbehavior as we increase the number of workers. The speed-\nup with smaller datasets is less because as we increase\nthe number of workers each worker gets a small load -\nmeaning less computational load and more time wasted\nin synchronization costs inherent in BSP. Dual simulation\n259\nalways shows the best speed-up and graph simulation shows\nthe least speed-up. The reason is because of the duality\ncondition, each worker has to do almost twice the work for\nevery vertex as compared to graph simulation, this increased\ncomputational load scales well as we increase the number\nof workers and consequently, dual simulation tends to show\nbetter speed-up.\nStrong simulation keeps bouncing between the other two\ndepending upon the distribution of the dual match - if they\nare well balanced across all workers, then balls are created\nin parallel and we get better speed-up and vice-versa. This is\nbecause ball-creation is a time-consuming process and slight\nimbalances can overload some workers, thus negatively\naffecting the overall speed-up. It must be noted that for the\nsynthesized dataset, we could not run the tests on a single\nworker due to the size of dataset. Using multiple datasets\nand queries, we calculated an average speedup of 1.82 from\none to two workers, thus in the graph we have extrapolated\nthe values marked by dotted line in figure 4c.\nVI. IMPACT OF GRAPH PARTITIONING\nWe used METIS [23] for graph partitioning, which can\npartition an unstructured graph into k parts using either\nmultilevel recursive bisectioning [26] or multilevel k-way\n[27] schemes. Both the models can provide high-quality yet\ndifferent partitions so we tried both to study the relative\nimpact. The algorithms work with a simple goal: edge-\ncut which basically tries to minimize the edges that travel\nbetween different well-balanced partitions. After extensive\nexperiments, k-way partitioning performed better so we only\nreport its results below.\nA. Experimental Setup\nWe conducted extensive testing of min-cut partitioning\non multiple datasets. We use both a real world dataset and\na synthesized dataset. uk-2002 [25] was used as the real\nlife dataset, that is a 2002 crawl of the .uk domain We\nalso synthesized a random-edge graph with |V | = 107 and\nan ? of 1.2. Because of space constraints and similarity of\nresults, we have omitted the results of synthesized [24] from\nthe paper, however, we do make a mention with explanation\nwhere we deem necessary.\nB. Experimental Results\nWe identify two complexity measures for our tests, \(1 2 the number of bytes sent among\nworkers to complete a given job.\n1 partitioning\non the runtime of algorithms, we compare its times against\nthe default partitioning round-robin We compare the times\nfor both by running them against queries of different sizes.\nIn figure 6. we see that the runtime for graph and dual\nsimulation are always faster with min-cut. This is because\nboth always communicate with their adjacent vertices only\nand with min-cut partitioning, there is a higher probability\nthe adjacent vertices will be on the same worker.\nHowever, strong simulation is different because when it is\nin the process of building the ball, it needs to communicate\nwith vertices that are further away from the center of the\nball This increases the probability that the vertex will\ncommunicate with a vertex that lies on some other partition,\nthus washing away any benefit that we obtained from min-\ncut partitioning. That is why, strong simulation appears\nmostly unaffected by either type of partitioning. The results\nfor the synthesized dataset were very similar to this real life\ndataset.\n2 needs to be moved between workers. By reducing the\ntotal network traffic, we increase our chances of reducing\nthe runtime and any cost associated with them. The effect\nof reduced data traffic could be more important when there is\na network-bandwidth limit in the system like geographically\ndistributed systems. In figure 7, we observe that the network\ntraffic for all always drop with min-cut partitioning - that is\ndue to the primary goal of min-cut partitioning which is to\nreduce the inter-partition communication. Information pro-\nvided in [25] shows the power-law nature of the real-world\ndatasets that we use in our experiments. This characteristic\nof the datasets is a contributive factor to the drastic drop in\nthe network traffic [28 Usually, these graphs have a few\nvertices that have a much higher connectivity to other ver-\ntices, with min-cut partitioning we move these vertices along\nwith their connections to the same worker, thus resulting\nin a drastic drop in the total traffic. A similar pattern is\nnot present in the synthesized dataset, since connectivity is\nuniform.\nVII. RELATED WORK\nThe problem of subgraph pattern matching is a widely\nstudied topic Over the years, many different graph pattern\nmatching techniques have been proposed. There are two\nbroad categories of matching, exact and inexact algorithms.\nSubgraph Isomorphism is one of the most well-renowned yet\nNP-complete problem which matches the graph based on the\nexact topological structure of a pattern. On the other hand,\na few alternative techniques like p-homomorphism [29] and\nbounded simulation [30], that rely on inexact but semantic\nmatching [5], have been proposed recently.\nAlthough the first practical distributed 


approach for graph\nsimulation was introduced in [31], their approach is not\nbased on a vertex-centric model and uses a modified version\nof the HHK [3] algorithm. Also, not all of its stages are\nrun in parallel and one is strictly serial.The idea of dual and\nstrong simulation were first introduced in [10]. To best of our\nknowledge, no other distributed algorithms are implemented\nfor these two models prior to our work.\n260\n\(a Graph Simulation \(b c dataset uk-2002-hc, ?q = 1.2\n\(a b c Partitioning effect on the network I/O of uk-2002-hc, ?q = 1.2\nGraph partitioning is another important problem that is\ngaining traction with the advent of distributed algorithms.\nThese algorithms mostly try to work with the goal of mini-\nmizing the edge-cut in the graph. METIS [23] is an effective\ntool that can employ two techniques to generate high-quality\npartitions. The effects of graph partitioning on different\nalgorithms have been studied by numerous researchers. [20]\ntalks about the impact of partitioning on algorithms like\nPageRank SSSP, etc. and report an impressive speed-up.\nVIII. CONCLUSION\nGraph pattern matching has been an important topic\nin the field of Computer Science and has been gaining\nprominence recently. It has become more challenging with\nthe rapidly increasing size of graphs. In this paper, we\nstudy the three polynomial time pattern matching techniques\nin detail. This paper draws the following conclusions with\nregards to the three distributed algorithms we developed for\ninexact graph pattern matching: \(1 we increase the number of workers, \(2 dual\nsimulation consistently especially with bigger queries, \(3 network I/O\namong workers and \(4 vertex in a vertex-\ncentric setting.\nIn the future, we intend to look into different ways to\nimprove the strong simulation running times on GPS and\nAkka. It is clear that we need to find out how we can improve\nthe process of ball-creation. Instead of creating the ball on\nevery dual-matched vertex, we intend to come up with tech-\nniques to reduce the total number of balls created without\ncompromising the results. We also want to come up with new\nalgorithms that do not suffer the synchronization bottlenecks\nof the BSP model, thus achieving better parallelism.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors would like to thank Dr. George Karypis and\nSemih Salihoglu for their generous help and assistance with\nMETIS and GPS, respectively.\nREFERENCES\n[1] A.

FINAL REMARKS\nIn this paper we presented an approach for supporting the\nenergy-aware adaptation of business processes at design time\ndriven by an optimization problem that takes into account both\ninfrastructural, applicative, and environmental standpoints. In\nparticular, the adaptation actions available to the application\ndesigner rely on the de?nition of variants for the tasks com-\nposing the business process.\nThis approach is now heavily based on the assumption that\nmonitored data about previous executions are available, and\ninformation able to give the values for the interesting metrics\nare all included in this knowledge base. For future development\nof our approach, we aim to relax this assumption, trying to\nunderstand if we can infer the values of the metrics in case\nthe data needed to compute them analytically are not present.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis work has been supported by the ECO2Clouds project\n\(http://eco2clouds.eu activity of the 7th Framework\nProgramme under contract number 318048.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Greenpeace, “How Clean Is Your Cloud?,” tech. rep., 04 2012.\n[2] A.

PARTITIONING SCHEME \nIn this section, we describe some additional details of the \npartitioning schemes. For a given n nodes and P processors, \nwe create P partitions Vo, V1 , . . .  Vp-1 . The processors are \nlabeled as 0, 1 ,  . . .  P - 1. Partition Vi is processed by pro­\ncessor i. For each scheme, we need to know i of nodes in each partition, and iii Below we show how to calculate them for the three \npartitioning schemes. \nA.1 Uniform Consecutive Partitioning UCP assigned to the par­\ntitions. \nPartition size: The sizes of the partitions are almost equal. \nLet B = I f5 l Then, the size of a partition is either B or \nB -1. \nPartition range: Partition i includes the nodes from iB nto \(i  + I III J . \nA.2 Linear Consecutive Partitioning \(LCP par­\ntitions, and the number of nodes in the partitions are mod­\neled by arithmetic progression a, a+d, a+2d a+\(P- l are partition pal'ame­\nters. At the end of this section, we discuss how a and d are \ndetermined. \nPartition range: Partition i has the nodes from L;:? \(a+ \njd 2a+\(?-1 a + jd i + 1 2a?id 1 .  \nFinding processor rank: Given a node u ,  we need to \nfind the partition i such that u E Vi, Node u satisfies the \nfollowing inequality: \ni-I \nl 2a + \(i - l i + 1 2a id 11 pa­\nrameters a and d are determined using the number of nodes \nn and the number of processors P. Parameter d 


is the slope \nof the straight line y = a + dx, where y represent the num­\nber of nodes in the processor with rank x = i. We calcu­\nlate d by finding two points on this straight line. Putting \ni = 0 and i = P -1 in Eqn 10, we can compute nl and \nnp- l .  Then, the number of nodes in the first processor is \nnl - no = nl and the number of nodes in last processor is \nnp - np- l = n - 1 - np- l .  Hence, we have \nNow, we have \nd = \nn - 1 np- l - nl \nP \n. \nP- l \n2 2a + \(P - l P - l Round Robin Partitioning \n\(12 partitions, the number of nodes is almost \nequal for all partitions.

This is because the \ntime in preparation may be very low while the time in space \nmay be very long. If the preparation period will be less than \nseveral weeks then sampling frequency should be ncontinuous or as continuous as feasible . If the preparation \nperiod for launch will occur over many weeks then the \nsampling frequency can be reduced to once/hour. \nIn general, the shorter the preparation time for launch the \nhigher the data sampling frequency is required. Preferably, \nprelaunch activity biological diagnostic data should be \nrecorded continuously and the data available for merging \nwith launch and on-orbit data. After a person initially \narrives in space, the sampling frequency should be \ncontinuous or near continuous . After the person has been in \nspace for several weeks, the sampling frequency can be \nreduced to once/hour. If a person is in space for several \nmonths, the sampling frequency can be reduced to as little \nas once/6 hours . \nTable 2.

Table 2 defmes the telemetry measurement \nsamples per measurement needed to predict mental illness \nfrom each of the different phases that data is generated and \nmade available for processing for completing prognostic \nanalysis during space exploration.

The measurement range is important to defme \nthe 5th or 6th degree polynomial used to convert the 8-bit \ndigital words in telemetry back to analog telemetry so the \ntelemetry processing and display system can accurately \ndisplay the biological and engineering diagnostic \ninformation to ground personnel for analysis. \n1 7  \nTable 3 .

CONCLUSION \nA prognostic and health management \(PHM industry telemetry to collect, store and distribute \nto remote locations the biological, diagnostic information \nfor process for predicting mental illness using with \npredictive algorithms .  The predictive algorithms are often \nproprietary and must be developed for use with aerospace \ntelemetry to compensate for the many shortcomings and \ncomplexities of CCSDS telemetry to be accurate and \nreliable. Our proprietary predictive algorithms were \npioneered on the Air Force's GPS satellites and Atlas launch \nvehicles over 30 years ago. They have also been \nsuccessfully used on other military, NASA and commercial \nsatellites, launch vehicles and missiles to illustrate the \npresence of accelerated aging in normal appearing \nequipment telemetry from completely normal behaving \nequipment. \nA behavior of a person ' s  FOFR can explain the cause ntreatment and the cure for mental illness .  The chemicals \n1 8  \nreleased by the FOFR when activated were developed by the \nFOFR to be in the body an extremely short duration. \nToday's  lifestyle has forced people to remain in threatening \nsituations forcing the presence of the toxic chemicals used \nby the FOFR for self preservation to be present for many \nyears at varying levels. The chemicals released by the FOFR \nand release of chemicals that are created as a result of the \nrelease of adrenaline and cortisol cause accelerated aging on \nthe entire body including all areas of the brain. When the \nFOFR is damaged from accelerated aging, it forces the \nbrain 's  chemistry to be altered by changing the ratios of \nthree main chemicals very, causing mental illness .  All the \nmedications used in mental health treat only the symptoms \nof mental illness and do not cure it. \nThe identification of accelerated aging in biological, \ndiagnostic telemetry can be used by ground personnel to \npredict the mental illness in personnel to be used for deep \nspace missions. The model of the brain' s  FOFR subsystem \nprovides the information necessary for the ground crew to \npredict and thus prevent mental illness from occurring by \nmaking the changes to the person ' s  environment. The PHM \nuses information obtained from a variety of mission phases \nincluding pre-launch readiness, launch and during deep nspace travel to develop baseline behavior from which \nmental illness can predicted so it can be prevented nREFERENCES \n[ 1 ] .

specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
