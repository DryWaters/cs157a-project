Research on the Application of Multidimensional Association Rule in Construction Accidents Analysis Wei-ke CHENi, Jin-ling LI2 School of Management, Tianjin University of Technology, Tianjin, China zSchool of Management, Tianjin University of Technology, Tianjin, China chenweike7@163.com, lijinling423@yahoo.cn Abstract -Recently, there have been more and more building construction accidents. Meanwhile, the reasons leading to these accidents are becoming increasingly complicated. In this paper, the multi-dimensional association rule is applied to help analyze the reasons of these construction accidents. This paper also shows how to identify the strong association rules among person instrument, environment and accident types. Furthermore through the application of the strong association rules in 387 cases, the frequent reasons leading to the accidents are identified and combined for the purpose of finding the regulations of the accidents. Finally, these rules are taken as the basis for the managers to make precaution decisions Keywords-Building Construction, Construction Accidents, Multidimensional Association Rules I. INTRODUCTION With the rapid development of economic, the construction industry, as one of the most significant productive sectors of national economy, plays an important role in infrastructures. However, attended with characters, such as only-one-time, complexity, and work in the open or lofty place, labor intensity and so on, the construction accidents have taken place frequently Meanwhile, the number of casualties is still on the rise According to incompletely statistics in reference [ 1], 387 safety accidents of level III during the construction period accrued from 1997 to 2006 among the whole nation There must be so many reasons that made the accidents caused. Then how to find the valuable potential ones becomes a urgent event. Based on the valid extracted information quoted from reference [2], the managers at the construction sites can organize the workers to do their jobs high efficiently The leading causes of death among construction workers around the whole nation could be divided into five mainly types, such as high falls, caving-in or collapse 


mechanical injury, poisoning and electrocution. The main reasons could be summed up into four groups, namely person factors, material or instrument factors environmental factors and management factors, etc Considering the difficulty to distinguish person factor from the management, this paper finally uses a famous method called Multidimensional Association Rules to analyze the potential relationship among the construction accidents, and then figure out some strong association 978-1-4244-6484-5/10/$26.00 2010 IEEE 1077 rules between "person-instrument-environment" and the types of accidents. The result of this research not only provides decision support for the administrative officials at the construction sits, but also could efficiently help reduce casualties and losses resulting from several uncertainties for the whole country II. THE ASSOCIATION RULES ON CONSTRUCTION ACCIDENST The causes of construction accidents cover human instruments environment and others, but generally a particular factor could hardly cause a certain accident Construction accidents happened frequently that resulting in interactions among several risk factors. Data mining is a process of identifying novel and potentially useful patterns in data. Further, as one of the most important analysis tools of Data mining, Association Rules could breakdown the causes of construction accidents and test all the combinations of all causes to get useful frequent predicate sets in order to generate strong association rules A. Association Rules Reference [3] shows that Agrawal put forward how to find the association rules from the frequent itemsets of customers' transactions in 1993. Association Rule is such a model that could deduce certain patter like "A ? BOO For an example, if define Affair A as instability of formwork support system and Affair B as caving-in, the patter of A ? B could be considered as this situation that when the formwork support system is out of instability during the construction, the building around the sites could cave in or collapse Supposed D= {T"Tz, .. . ,Tn}, Tj{j=I,2, ... ,n 


short of Transaction T as customers' transactions database the elements of Transaction T, ik\(k=I,2, ... ,p called as Itemsets. Set the all collections of D's itemsets as I= {i"h, . . . ,im}, apparently TC I A as well as B are both itemsets in D, and AnB= <I the association rule, A ? B, would be constrained by two parameters. One parameter is Support, and the other is Confidence. Support can be defined as one kind of ratio of that the Transaction D contains simultaneously Itemsets A and Itemsets B, and then support shows frequency of the association rules. Confidence can be defined as other kind of ratio that Itemsets A contains simultaneously Itemsets A and Itemsets B, and then confidence shows strength of the association rules 3 According to the characteristics and causes of the construction accidents, set up data attributes as "Person Instrument-Environment". These attributes are showed in Table l I f  Support of Itemset A meets min-Support shorts for minimum Support threshold value, namely we could call A as Frequent Itemsets A of Transaction D. At the same time, supposed that the Association Rule A ? B exists Strong Association Rule is such a rule that not only the Table I Data attribute on construction accident accidents of Level support of A ? B meets default min-support, but also the confidence of A ? B also meets.

Then explain and evaluate the meaning of the produced association rules to help decision-making C Sample Data 1 2 the inconsistent or error construction accident data record in order to make the data accurately. Through Data Cleaning, mainly solve the special accident data that would impact the coincidence of data files According to the historical construction accident data of level III quoted in reference [5], use the Sample Selection Method to figure out these 20 samples shown in Table 2 Table 2 Sample data on construction accident of Level III Accident Time City Description Person Instrument Environment A T C D P I E AOOI 1997.4 Wuhu High fall Operation contrary to instruction Instrument failure Complicate sites AOO2 1997.7 Gansu High fall Operation contrary to instruction Instrument failure Complicate sites AOO3 1998.6 Dalian Poisoning No professional skill No security equipment Poisonous gas AOO4 1998.9 Hegang Collapse Others Others Complicate sites AOO5 1999.1 Tianjin Fire Operation contrary to instruction Others Complicate sites A006 1999.6 Anshan Collapse Bad commanding No security equipment Erodes

The Single-dimensional Rules can handle with relations among the single attributes data. Multi-dimensional Rules is dealing with some of the relationship between the various attributes data. Therefore multidimensional association rules mining that this paper discussed analyzes the accidents from the different aspects, such as person instruments or environment and so on, in order to figure out why the accidents happened According to the types of the accidents, Association Rules contains Boolean types and numerical types Boolean type of Association Rules could tell some relationships from the discrete and variable accidents. For the numerical data, this mining method can proceed with dynamic segmentation, or directly have the original data processed The process of Multidimensional Association Rules mining can be summarized as two phases I database 2 association rules, which meet the minimum support and 


minimum confidence, would be set up in order to provide basis for the decision-making III. APPLICATON AND EV ALVA TION A. Dala Cleaning According to the purpose of finding the rules that reasons of construction accidents account for the type of them, supposed that the sample data in Table 2 are completive records. And to put forward relevant rules easily, the specific accident attributes like Accident, Time and City will be removed. Finally, the attributes of these columns like Type, Person, Instrument and Environment left B Multidimensional Attribute I hierarchy will be defined as that the original value of the property would be replaced by interval values or concepts of higher layer, the similar concept is shown in reference 6]. The classification of different dimensions on construction accident would be shown in Table 3 2 sample data can be expressed as AOOI {ThPhI3};A002{TI ,Phll};A003 {T3,P3,h};A004 T 2,P 6,4} ;A005 {T s,P I ,14} ;A006 {T 2,P 4,1 I} ;A007 {T 2,P 1,1 I A008{Ts,PhI3};A009 {T2,Ps.h};AOIO {T 2,P6.h};AOll {T2 p 4.14} ;AO 12 {T 3.P 4.14} ;AO 13 {T 2.Plh} ;AO 14 {T 2,P 4.h} ;AO 15 {ThPI.II };AOI6 {T 2.Phll} ;AOI7 {T 4.P4.11 };AOI8 {Ts,P3 h} ;AOI9{Ts,Phll} ;A020 {T 2.P6.h 1079 3 three dimensions, Type. Person and Environment, have been selected for the dimensions of Data Cube showed in reference [7 4 in Reference [4], this paper sets 2 as minimum support counts. Then this paper would look for frequent predicate sets According to the sample data on construction accidents, the association rules are produced by frequent predicate sets. The sets are SI= {Th Ph Id, S2= {T2, Ph II S3= {T2, P4 Id and S4= {T2, P6 12 Table 3 the Classification of Different Dimensions on Construction Accidents

T2 6 the construction accidents of level III, the effective and value strong association rules could be expressed as Bad command, instrument failure ? collapse accident Support= 10%, Confidence= 1 OO Other person-factors, no protection ? collapse accident, \(Support= 10%, Confidence= 1 OO In construction process, a bad command plus instrument failure often make collapse accident happened Under other person-factors and no protection devices situation, collapse accident would take place. According to the result, in construction sites, the management officials should pay more attention on commanding 


equipment failures and safety measures N. TEST RESULTS Based on 387 safety accidents of level III during the construction accidents accrued from 1997 to 2006 among the whole nation, this paper selects the four dimensions Type, Person, Instrument and Environment, to find the association rules. Let min-sup be 2.5% and min-conf be 70%, valuable results are listed below Frequent predicate sets are those followings CD high fall, instruction, no protection instrument operation at high position \(support account is 12 collapse, operation contrary to instruction, no protection instrument, complicate sites \(support account is 15 collapse, no security check, no protection instrument, complicate sites \(support account is 14 poisoning, bad commanding, no protection instrument, poisonous gas \(support account is 18 Strong association rules are those followings CD operation contrary to instruction, no protection instrument, operation at high position ? high fall \(the value of confidence is 80 1080 operation contrary to instruction, no protection instrument, complicate sites ? collapse \(the value of confidence is 88 no security check, no protection instrument complicate sites ? collapse \(the value of confidence is 93 bad commanding, no protection instrument poisonous gas ? poisoning \(the value of confidence is 100 From the valuable strong association rules, the workers who operate in high during the course of construction without protection equipment would have an accident of high-falls with 80% possibility. Sometimes the constructors conduct some construction without safety equipments at complex sites would be in the accident situation of collapse contrary to instruction with 88 possibility. After construction, perhaps 93 percent of the workers who then do some operation in the complex construction sites without certain security checks and 


protection equipments would be injured under the situation of caving-in. Otherwise, along with the poisonous gas leaking out, the construction operators get poisoned, however, the management officials commit some bad commanding at the construction sites, then the operators still do their work without security equipments so that the accident of poisoning happen almost If other reasons exist, using frequent predicate sets summarized by construction accidents can find other potential rules with more than 80% of confidence in the data, which also have proved the summarized rules are reliable V. CONCLUSION Due to the construction of accidents, finally accidents records on construction increase sharply. With the aspect of Data Mining, this paper tries to provide a kind of decision support tool for construction units. Having established a model of multidimensional association rules this research could figure out why so many accidents took place by using the relevant records on construction through the relationship between the types of construction accidents and the dimensions of "person-instrument environment". In practical applications, the two significant parameters, minimum support and minimum confidence, influence the accuracy of association rules during the process of data mining. Therefore with the help of related experts or experienced personnel jointly, the parameters can be defined properly. That mining some relationships among construction accidents, can in a certain extent have some assistants for helping change the present situation of construction accidents occurred frequently, and plays a role of the warning, which help make correct and effective decision REFERENCES I] Xiao-wen ZHU, "Analysis on Present Safety Situation of Chinese Construction Industry," China Public Security no.12, pp. 27-29,2008 2] Jia-wei HAN, Bo KAN, Technology and Concepts of Data mining.

The proposed algorithm is tested on all the five datasets prepared by Roberto Bayardo, from UCI and PUMSB datasets. The datasets are available at http://fimi.cs.helsinki.fi. The characteristics of the datasets are shown in Table 6. The first column contains the names of the datasets. The second column shows the number of items contained in each dataset. The third column shows the average length of each transaction and the last column indicates the total number of transactions in each dataset TABLE 6 DATABASE CHARACTERISTICS Datasets Items Avg. length Records mushroom 119 23 8,124 chess 75 37 3,196 pusmsb* 2,088 50.4 49,046 connect 129 43 65,557 pusmsb 2,113 74.0 49,046 In order to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm, BitApriori is compared to the fast Apriori implemented in Ferenc [20], and another similar recently published, algorithm Index-BitTableFI proposed by Song [16]. In order to show the efficiency of the pruning technology employed in BitApriori another algorithm BitAprioriNE, which is the same as BitApriori, except that it does not use the special equal-support pruning, is designed. All of the above four algorithms are implemented in C++ and compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0. The experiments are performed on a Windows XP PC equipped with a Pentium 2.0 GHz CPU and 1.5 GB of RAM memory  For each dataset, a mass of different support thresholds are tested, and the five most important of them are chosen for reporting in this paper. The experimental results are shown in Fig. 3-7. In the figures, the y-coordinate denotes the execution time \(in seconds while x-coordinate denotes the support threshold 0 100 200 300 400

In this dataset, the special equal-support pruning works efficiently. In Fig. 4, BitAprioriNE beats Apriori and Index-BitTableFI. In Fig. 5, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified, especially when the minimum support is low. In Fig. 6, BitAprioriWE exhausts the memory when the support threshold is lower than 0.8, but BitApriori does not. That means the special equal-support pruning contributes to save the memory. In Fig. 7, when the threshold is larger than 0.725, Apriori beats the BitApriori. But BitApriori outperforms the Apriori, when the threshold is lower than 0.725  


Apriori does not use the binary string and the special equal-support pruning. The BitTable is employed in Index-BitTableFI, but there is no special equal-support pruning, except for the frequent 2-itemsets BitAprioriNE outperforms Apriori in Fig. 3-5, but not in Fig. 6-7, because of the limitation of memory BitAprioriNE does better than Index-BitTableFI in Fig 4 and Fig. 5. In the mushroom, there is a vast number of equal-support itemsets for frequent 2-itemset. So Index-BitTableFI outperforms BitAprioriNE  On one hand, the special equal-support pruning is a useful technique for improving efficiency. The performance is improved significantly, especially when the databases contain many equal-support itemsets, such as the mushroom. It also reduces memory requirement On the other hand, the technique of binary string in BitApriori improves the efficiency of Apriori. These two techniques combine perfectly in BitApriori. So BitApriori has very good performance. It is the best for all of the five datasets  6. CONCLUSIONS  In this paper, two effective techniques are employed to improve the performance of Apriori, by reducing the cost of candidate generation, and by support counting The two effective techniques are integrated perfectly in BitApriori, and improve the computational efficiency significantly. Experimental results have shown that BitApriori outperforms the fast Apriori and Index-BitTableFI, especially when the minimum support threshold is low  When the database is large, the BitApriori may suffer the problem of memory scarcity. So how to solve the memory problem will be the question addressed in one of our future works. And another work is to improve Bitwise And Operation on the binary string, or replace it by some more effective techniques  REFERENCES
