Abstract 
We present a new augmented reality AR system for knowledge-intensive location-based expert work The multi 
modal interaction system combines multiple on-body input and output devices a speech-based dialogue system a head-mounted augmented reality display HMD and a head-mounted eyetracker The interaction devices have been selected to augment and improve the expert work in a speciìc medical application context which shows its potential In the sensitive domain of examining patients in a cancer screening program we try to combine several active user input devices in the most convenient way for both the patient and the doctor The resulting multimodal AR is an on-body intelligent environment IE and has the 
potential to yield higher performance outcomes and provides a direct data acquisition control mechanism It leverages the doctorês capabilities of recalling the speciìc patient context by a virtual context-based patient-speciìc external brain for the doctor which can remember patient faces and adapts the virtual augmentation according to the speciìc patient observation and nding context In addition patient data can be displayed on the HMDÑtriggered by voice or object/patient recognition The learned patient faces and immovable objects e.g a big medical device deìne the environmental clues to make the context 
dependent recognition model part of the IE to achieve speciìc goals for the doctors in the hospital routine 
I I NTRODUCTION In ubiquitous computing it can be said that most profound technologies are those that disappear by weaving themselves into the fabric of everyday professional life It would be even better if we could carry and wear those technologies on our bodies which would make us rather independent of the location

in which they are used For documentation purposes in the myths of the paperless ofìce  digital pens for e xample have been invented and used to implement paper-based interactions in digital environments 14 The problem is that you cannot easily replace a screen-based laptop computer because the display is often missing for a proper interaction and time-based transient interaction modes such as speech dialogue cannot replace them properly Recent display systems are available as head-mounted displays HMDs which provide new ubiquitous possibilities for interaction and real-time sys 
tems often referred to as cyber-physical systems In this paper we propose a new multimodal interaction system that can also learn important task-relevant visual information Fig 1 Patient Examination Scenario where the doctor wears a head-mounted eye-tracker and an HMD The multimodal interaction system combines multiple on-body input and output devices a speech-based dialogue system a head-mounted augmented reality display and a head-mounted eye-tracker The interaction devices have been selected to aug 
ment and improve the expert work for a particular application domain the physical examination of patients during cancer screening The scenario is shown in gure 1 Our main contribution is that we bring two major normally separated goals of intelligent interaction together thereby combining active and passive user input devices in the most convenient way for both the patient and the doctor First we want to leverage the doctorês capabilities to recall patients and inform himself about a speciìc patient record For this purpose we implemented the rst online head-mounted face learning 
system which uses a mobile eye-tracker In the most advanced interface mode we allow for a real-time interactive face detection Second in the interactive experience with the doctor and the patient the system should improve the performance of the human-computer interaction and the usability in the patient context no disturbing computer screen between the patient and the doctor For this purpose we use the gaze position on the HMD in combination with an automatic speech recognizer

ASR as part of the multimodal interaction structure As a result we implemented the rst multimodal interaction system which combines a mobile eye-tracker with a head-mounted display and this in combination with speech-based interaction which can now be evaluated for its task-based usability Towards this goal we provide a preliminary evaluation of the face learning and detection mode to identify avenues for further improvements of the technical machine learning approach The design of the learning and detection system could lead to new visions of other application domains interacting with mobile HMD technology and provide more dedicated scenarios where the object/face detection task can be facilitated II R ELATED W ORK Motivated by previous ndings showing the relevance of eye-gaze in multimodal conversational interfaces we e xtended the passive input idea to active user input in the medical augmented reality realm This also extends the work of using the gaze information to resolve the ambiguities of users speech  In the medical domain se v eral e xperimental settings with HMDs neither using eye-trackers nor speech input have been investigated Consider the following application example with the standard working position at the ultrasound machine with a normal display a doctor can look at the display to see the results of a scan But he or she has to turn the head towards the patient when repositioning the probe Thus in the usage of a HMD in ultrasound scanning task has been investigated as there is no need to turn the head any more Image guided surgery has been introduced successfully in many modern operating rooms In order to improve the navigation on a standard computer monitor enhanced the direct sight of the physician by an HMD overlay of the virtual data onto the doctorês view in the context of the patient In HMDs have been used in various forms to assist surgeons and other medical personnel to support and improve the visualisation of the workplace related procedures III C OMPLETE S CENARIO AND M ULTIMODAL D IALOGUE S YSTEM A RCHITECTURE Over the last several years the market for speech technology has seen signiìcant developments and po werful commercial off-the-shelf solutions for speech recognition ASR or speech synthesis TTS For industrial application tasks such medicine discourse and dialogue infrastructures are available  The run-time environment we use in this special I/O scenario is based on a middleware platform which connects system components and follows a hub-and-spoke architecture The architecture comprises a number of functional components that deal with tasks like modality-speciìc interpretation contextbased interpretation interaction and task management target control presentation management and modality-speciìc generation All functional components are generally applicationindependent and are conìgured by respective models We use a distributed dialogue system architecture where every major component can be run on a different platform increasing the scalability of the overall system gure 2 Thereby the dialogue system also acts as middleware between the clients and the backend services This architectural characteristic is very suitable to monitor internal and external messages of the three major parts the multimodal interface the dialogue system and the event bus The event bus basically provides a data streaming functionality for the automatic speech recogniser ASR/NLU and the text-to-speech synthesis TTS One of the functional components of the dialogue system is the fusion and discourse engine FADE while another is the reaction and presentation component REAPR Both are important for the mobile eye-tracker and mobile HMD scenario more information about the hub-and-spoke dialogue infrastructure can be found in 13 and 12 FADE is needed to compute the discourse-context information It is based on a fusion approach which waits for appropriate multimodal input to be fused together for a interpretation that can be stored in the question and answer QA database Dialogue processing in REAPR means that the dialogue information state is implemented Information state theory of dialogue modelling basically consists of a description of informal components e.g obligations beliefs desires intentions their formal representations data structures such as ontology instances as in our case dialogue moves often conceived of as speech acts update rules trigger moves and updates of state information and update strategies in which order to apply the applicable update rules While obligations and dialogue moves do no have a role to play in the current version the integration with context-based presentation of patient information or the recognition itself is straightforward Essentially the display context deìnes what the user sees in the HMD Upon recognition of an object or person by the eyetracker and recognisers REAPR triggers the context-dependent display in the mobile HMD Other context factors such as patient and examination context can be smoothly integrated into the context model In addition REAPR is also responsible for initiating a potential TTS synthesis For example thatês patient x age 37 In our scenario we focus on the multimodal dialogue interactions which directly relevant to active learning part of the HMD and eye-tracker scenario 1 The user gazes at the microphone button and starts the ASR we use dwell time for selection 500ms the Midas touch problem is circumvented by the size and positioning of the microphone 2 The user says learn a new person which issues a respective command in the multimodal interface and the eye-tracker connection 3 Upon face recognition FADE gets informed about a face and remembers the database instance which is stored in the service backend 4 The user looks again on the microphone and starts the ASR 5 The user says This is a new patient Peter Meier which the FADE module fuses into a face image database command now containing the face classiìcation features and the name of the newly created patient database instance IV E YE T RACKER AND HMD D ISPLAY Over several decades researchers

Fig 2 HCI Architecture and Online Learning Framework The red boxes indicate the active dialogue modules during the HMD interaction The resulting augmentation in the see-through HMD contains patient name age and last examination information background scene photo courtesy of Siemens AG The gaze cursor is not visible in the HMD compact mobile eye-tracker is available today it enables us to use gaze as an interface in various scenarios 2 In our multimodal dialogue system we use the SMI Eye Tracking Glasses ETG 1 in order to recognise which person the doctor is looking at in the examination room and to obtain the gaze position in the HMD ETG is a binocular eye tracker which captures the images of both eyes and computes the gaze position in a scene image which in turn is captured by the scene camera located in the center of the glasses In order to obtain accurate gaze positions the user is required to do a system calibration before using it The calibration is done by looking at one or three point\(s indicated by the system Brother recently released a product of new head mounted display whose feature is the transparency of the display The user can see the environment through the display when nothing is displayed We combined this HMD with the ETG 
One of the most primitive and intuitive ways for calibrating HMDs is to use a gaze cursor By using user gaze as an input source for commands the user can control the system intuitively In order to display a gaze cursor on the HMD we need to calibrate the HMD so that the system can compute gaze position on the HMD Examples of scene image and the user view are shown in gure 3 From the user perspective the HMD can be seen as shown in the top of the image light blue rectangle but for the scene camera where the HMD is located it is unknown We propose two different methods for display calibration gaze based calibration and scene image based calibration as shown in gure 3 We implemented both of them for a comparison From the SMI eye tracker we then receive a scene image 1280x960 and a gaze position coordinate of the scene image e.g x:220,y:341 The gaze-based calibration can be seen on the the lower right image of gure 3 A red point appears in the HMD when the calibration process starts The user has to stare at the point which means he has to look at it for a few seconds Then the system computes the mean position of the gaze samples received from the eye tracker By repeating this process four times with different point locations we get four corresponding points between eye tracker and the HMD These corresponding points supply us with the calibration parameters in the mathematical formulas of perspective transformation The drawback of this method is that the performance dependents fully on the accuracy of the eye tracker If you get noisy gaze data you will most likely get wrong transformation parameters In scene-based calibration the whole scene image captured by the camera is shown in the HMD gure 3 lower left The user has to click on the position of each corner of the HMD In this way the calibration system knows where the HMD is located in the scene image We use a mouse for the calibration interaction Once you get the location of the HMD in the scene image you can easily transport the gaze position from the eyetracker to the HMD This method seems to be more promising 1 http://eyetracking-glasses.com

Fig 3 Display Calibration because you donêt have to rely on the performance of the eye tracker Furthermore you may also overlay an image in the augmented reality vision We used the second method in the application system and we think this is a better option from the performance point-ofview However the process of calibration might be complicated for users in a working environment Therefore we still need to evaluate the different methods from a usability and ease-of-use perspective After calibration we get the gaze position in the HMD so we can trigger the microphone event when the user gazes at the microphone button which appears in the left top of the HMD V F ACE R ECOGNITION In this system we combine a face recognition framework with the eye-tracking system in order to recognise the patient being examined i.e to provide the doctor with the imagecontent-based external brain The face recognition procedure illustrated in gure 4 follows the following procedure 1 The scene image and the gaze position is obtained from the eye tracker Then 2 Find the face closest to the gaze position The detection of the faces in the video image\(s is done via Haar-like features and an AdaBoost learning cascade see for further details we used the OpenCV2.3 implementation in combination with a raster scan method 3 Compute the Local Binary Pattern LBP features from the face images 4 Execute a nearest neighbor search and nd the nearest face from the database to improve the speed of search we may later use an approximate nearest neighbour search like once distincti v e features are identiìed on a larger population 5 Get a result and send it from the multimodal input interface to the REAPR display context which triggers the presentation of real-time results in the HMD It is to be noted that in video streams the system sometimes returns false results for example if we have 85 accuracy 15 frames out of 100 frames are expected to be false results In order to remove this kind of noisy results and to obtain more accurate results we also applied an attention detection approach This simple heuristic counts the number of frames that have the same recognition results and if the number reaches the threshold the system assumes that the user is really looking at an object or person report that this approach effectively detects in combination with a 3D object recognition framework the object that drew the userês attention In our tests we observe this also holds for the face recognition framework in a mobile non-stationary environment of the head-mounted camera

Fig 4 Face Recognition VI P RELIMINARY E VALUATION OF THE L EARNING S YSTEM We conducted a preliminary test for online face recognition Thereby we focussed on the general applicability of the technical methods for a mobile head-mounted active learning environment In this preliminary test test users wore the eyetracker and we recorded two video 223les with eye-tracking data from eight different person\220s faces in the same condition in the same room and with the same lighting conditions similar to the examination room in 223gure 1 The 223rst video is used to extract training face images 5 face images from each person and the second is used for testing We then checked in how far the faces from the test video can be recognised while using our method As a result we achieved 100 precision and 68 recall on average This result indicates that if the training is done in the same condition as the use case this online face recognition method performs well We found out why the recall rate is lower when the patient\220s face is too dark the face classi\223cation cannot be performed successfully However in our examination scenario we can provide for suitable conditions for face recognition good lighting to reveal many individual face textures thus this problem could be solved in a real examination environment 
We recorded two videos for each person 8 persons One video was used for trainning where 5 face imgages were extracted Then we checked how accurately the faces from the other video test video were recognised Both videos were recorded in the same indoor environment The study was conducted in our research lab We used two standard laptop computers ThinkPads X201 to connect to the eye tracker and the HMD to classify the incoming data streams and to synchronise the behaviour with the speech-based dialogue system The multimodal dialogue system except for the multimodal interface runs on a third ThinkPads X201 laptop computer Standard Java network packages take care of the data exchange between the headmounted I/O devices and the dialogue system VII C ONCLUSION We combined multiple on-body input and output devices namely a speech-based dialogue system a head-mounted augmented reality display and a head-mounted eye-tracker and implemented a complete IE scenario in a speci\223c medical application context which shows its potential The choice of the HMD device and the eye-tracker is very important because of the calibration need One has to consider the precision of the mapping of the HMD result to the screen as well as the handling of the eye-tracker gaze position The resulting interaction should however be very natural to the user like looking on thinks and imagining their relevance to the working context Using gaze and speech input has the potential to make daily routine a bit more effective and yield higher performance outcomes on similar knowledge intensive tasks

columns based on probabilities calculated using the leading right singular vectors and then employs a deterministic algorithm to select exactly columns from the columns sampled in the rst stage However the algorithm depends on calculating the leading right singular vectors which is time-consuming for large data sets The hybrid algorithms for CSS can be easily implemented on MapReduce if the randomized selection step is MapReduce-efìcient and the deterministic selection step can be implemented on a single machine This is usually true if the number of columns selected by the randomized step is relatively small In comparison to other CSS methods the algorithm proposed in this paper is designed to be MapReduce-efìcient In the distributed selection step representative columns are selected based on a common representation The common representation proposed in this work is based on random projection This is more efìcient than the work of C ivril and Magdon-Ismail which selects columns based on the leading singular vectors In comparison to other deterministic methods the proposed algorithm is speciìcally designed to be parallelized which makes it applicable to big data matrices whose columns are massively distributed On the other hand the two-step of distributed then centralized selection is similar to that of the hybrid CSS methods The proposed algorithm however employs a deterministic algorithm at the distributed selection phase which is more accurate than the randomized selection employed by hybrid methods in the rst phase VIII E XPERIMENTS Experiments have been conducted on two big data sets to evaluate the efìciency and effectiveness of the proposed distributed CSS algorithm on MapReduce The properties of the data sets are described in Table I The is a subset of the RCV1 data set which has been prepared and used by Chen et al to e v aluate parallel spectral clustering algorithms The data set contains 1 million images that were sampled from the 80 million tiny images data set and con v erted to grayscale Similar to previous work on CSS the different methods are evaluated according to their ability to minimize the reconstruction error of the data matrix based on the subset of selected columns In order to quantify the reconstruction error across different data sets a relative accuracy measure is deìned as Relative Accuracy where is the rankapproximation of the data matrix based on a random subset of columns is the rankapproximation of the data matrix based on the subset of columns and is the best rankapproximation of the data matrix calculated using the Singular Value Decomposition SVD This measure compares different methods relative to the uniform sampling as a baseline with higher values indicating better performance The experiments were conducted on Amazon EC2 2 clusters which consist of 10 instances for the data set and 20 instances for the data set Each instance has a 7.5 GB of memory and a two-cores processor All instances are running Debian 6.0.5 and Hadoop version 1.0.3 The data sets were converted into a binary format in the form of a sequence of pairs Each pair consisted of a column index as the key and a vector of the column entries That is the standard format used in Mahout 3 for storing distributed matrices The distributed CSS method has been compared with different state-of-the-art methods It should be noted that most of these methods were not designed with the goal of applying them to massively-distributed data and hence their implementation on MapReduce is not straightforward However the designed experiments used the best practices for implementing the different steps of these methods on MapReduce to the best of the authors knowledge In speciìc the following distributed CSS algorithms were compared  is uniform sampling of columns without replacement This is usually the worst performing method in terms on approximation error and it will be used as a baseline to evaluate methods across different data sets  and  are different distributed variants of the hybrid CSS algorithm which can be implemented efìciently on MapReduce In the randomized phase the three methods use probabilities calculated based on uniform sampling column norms and the norms of the leading singular vectors rows respectively The number of selected columns in the randomized phase is set to  In the deterministic phase the centralized greedy CSS is employed to select exactly columns from the randomly sampled columns  is an extension of the centralized algorithm for sparse approximation of Singular Value Decomposition SVD The distrib uted CSS algorithm presented in this paper Algorithm 4 is used 2 Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud EC2 http://aws.amazon.com/ec2 3 Mahout is an Apache project for implementing Machine Learning algorithms on Hadoop See http://mahout.apache.org

messages seen for all workers in a superstep \(Figures 10 and 13\. When looking at the messages sent by workers in a superstep for METIS, we see that there are message load imbalances within work ers in a superstep, caused due to concentration of vertices being traversed in that superstep in certain partitions This variability is much more pronounced in CP as compared to WG \(Figures 11 and 14\ E.g. in superstep 9 for CP, twice as many messages \(4M\ are generated by a worker compared to another \(2M\.  For Pregel BSP, the time taken in a superstep is determined by the slowest worker in that superstep. Hence increase d variability in CP causes even çgoodé partitioning strategies to cause an increase in total execution time wh en using the Pregel/BSP model VIII A NALYSIS OF E LASTIC C LOUD S CALING  Cloud environments offer elasticity Ö the ability to scale-out or scale-in VMs on-demand and only pay for what one uses [28   On th e f l i p s i de  on e en ds u p  paying for VMs that are acquired even if they are underutilized. We have already shown the high variation in compute/memory resources used by algorithms like BC and APSP across different supersteps. While our earlier swath initiation heuristics attempt to flatten these out by overlapping swath executions, one can consider leveraging the cloudês elasticity to, instead, scale up and down the concurrent workers \(and graph partitions\ allocated in each superstep The peak and trough nature of resource utilization combined with Pregel/BSPês synchronous barrier between supersteps offers a window for dynamic scaleout and Öin at superstep boundaries. Peak supersteps can greatly benefit from additional workers, while those same workers will contribute to added synchronization overhead for trough supersteps We offer an analysis of the potential benefits of elastic scaling by extrapolating from observed results for running BC on WG and CP graphs, using four and eight workers.  To provide a fair and focused comparison, we turned off swath heuristics in favor of fixed swath sizes and initiation intervals Figure 15 \(Bottom\ plots the speedup of BC running on eight workers when normalized to BC running on four workers, at corresponding supersteps.  The number of workers does not impact the number of supersteps We also plot the number of active vertices \(i.e. vertices still computing for a given swath\these supersteps which is a measure of how much work is required \(Fig 15 \(Top\. We find that we occasionally get superlinear speedup spikes \(i.e. >2x\ that shows a strong correlation with the peaks of active messages, for both WG and CP graphs. At other times, the sp eedup is sublinear or even a speed-down \(i.e. <1\responding to inactive vertices.  The superlinear speedup is attributable to the lower contention and reduced memory pressure for 8 workers when the active vertices peak \(similar to what we observed for the swath initiation heuristics Similarly, the below par speedup during periods of low activity is contributed by the increased overhead of barrier synchronization across 8 workers. Intuitively, by dynamically scaling up the number of workers for supersteps with peaking active vertices and scaling them down otherwise, we can leverage the superlinear speedup and get more value per worker Using a threshold of 50% active vertices as the threshold condition for between 4 and 8 workers in a superstep, we extrapolate the time per superstep and compared this to the fixed 4 and 8 worker runtimes. We also compute the best-case run time using an çoracleé approach to i.e. for each superstep, we pick the minimum of the 4 or 8 workerês time.  Note that these projections do not yet consider the overheads of scaling, but are rather used to estimate the potential upside if we had an ideal or an automated heuristic for scaling. The total time estimates for running BC on WG and CP graphs, normalized to

observed time taken using 4 workers, are plotted in Figures 16\(A\ and 16\(B We see that our dynamic scaling heuristic using the percentage of active vertices achieves nearly the same CP\ or better \(WG\ performance as a fixed 8 worker approach. Clearly there is benefit of using fewer workers for low utilization su persteps to eliminate the barrier synchronization overhead. Also, the dynamic scaling heuristic performs almost as well as the ideal scaling. Finally, when we consider the monetary cost of the proposed approaches, assuming a pro-rata normalized cost per VM-second plotted on the secondary Y axis, we see that dynamic scaling is comparable \(CP\ or cheaper \(WG\ than a 4 worker scenario while offering the performance of an 8 worker deployment IX C ONCLUSION  In conclusion, we introduce optimization and heuristics for controlling memory utilization and show they are critical to performance.  By breaking computation into swaths of vertices and using our sizing heuristics we achieve up to 3.5x speedup over the maximum swath size that does not cause the a failure.  In addition overlapping swath executions can provide a 24% gain with automated heuristics and even greater speedup when a priori knowledge of the network characteristics is applied This evaluation offers help to eScience users to make framework selection and cost-performancescalability trade-offs. Our he uristics are generalizable and can be leveraged by other BSP and distributed graph frameworks, and for graph applications beyond BC. Our work uncovered an unexpected impact of partitioning and it would be worthwhile, in future, to examine the ability to pred ict, given certain graph properties, a suitable partitioning model for Pregel/BSP It may also be useful to perform such evaluations on larger graphs and more numbers of VMs. At the same time, it is also worth considering if non-linear graph algorithms are tractable in pr actice for large graphs in a distributed environment B IBLIOGRAPHY  1  F  L i lj er os C   Ed l i n g L  A m a r a l H  S t an ley   and Y    berg The web of human sexual contacts

All rights reserved  Issues and Observations Initial load of one day of data ~ 7 hours Optimizations  Write data in batches  Use a mutable data structure to create data strings  Deploy a higher performance machine  Use load instead of insert  Use DB2 Range-Partitioned tables  Database tunings Time reduced from 7 hours to approx 30 minutes 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Use a mutable data structure to create data strings  Original application created the SQL statement by appending elements to a Java String  It was taking five hours \(of the seven hours Strings  Instead Java StringBuilder used  Java Strings immutable  Time savings of 71.4 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Deployed on a higher-performance machine  Application ported from IBM Blade Center HS21 \(4GB of RAM and 64-bit dual-core Xeon 5130 processor to Dell M4500 computer \(4GB of RAM and 64-bit of quad-core Intel Core i7 processor  Reduced the time to thirty minutes Bulk loading instead of insert  Application was modified to write CSV files for each table  Entire day worth of data bulk loaded  Reduced the time to fifteen minutes 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Range-Partitioned tables \(RPT  To limit the size of tables, the original code created multiple tables per table type  This puts burden on the application to query multiple tables when a range crosses several tables  With RPT, user is not required to make multiple queries when a range crosses a table boundary  Increased the time to thirty minutes  Additional fifteen minute cost per day of partitioning enabled time savings during queries 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Database tunings  Range periods changed from a week to a month  Automatic table space resizing changed from 32MB to 512KB  Buffer pool size decreased  Decreased the time to twenty minutes Overall, total time savings of 95.2
