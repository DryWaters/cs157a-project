systems that are too complex or too ill-defined to 
apply precise mathematical analysis Thus it is quite logical to consider a fuzzy logic based tracker to process maneuvering targets Since

Although NJPDA does not show any bias simulation results we observe the following Fuzzy logic and rule based systems are a means of dealing with imprecision a method of modeling human behavior and a means of achieving control of industrial systems that cannot be modeled rigorously The principal difference from the conventional techniques is that the fuzzy approach uses qualitative information We have implemented a fuzzy tracker based on the existing ac-P smoothing algorithm and developed a subjective knowledge augmented data association algorithms An intuitive reason why the fuzzy logic provides better performance is the fuzzified decision boundaries resulting in a weighted average of possible decision rules and utilization of information features that cannot be easily quantified or are overlooked in conventional techniques However it should be noted that the fuzzy method requires comprehensive knowledge acquisition to formulate a successful rule base Estimation with Unknown

Clearly the lower the above probability  the so-called p-value  the more statistically significant the rule X  Y since it is less likely that X and Y are inde pendent In our experiments we ensure that all rules have p-values of X or less, where X is a user-specified threshold Local Pruning In addition to the global pruning described above we also prune locally on various subsets of the rules discovered Specifically our tool allows the user to browse 1 rules that demonstrate reuse of a particular library class and 2 rules that are violated in a particular application \(where the tool acts like a \223reuse lint\224 In the former case we consider only the set of rules with that library class in the antecedent or consequent In the latter case we consider only those rules that are violated by at least one class in the application of interest. Either way once we have extracted the subset of rules we follow the same local pruning procedure when presenting the results to the user The motivation for local pruning is the following given the presence of a particular rule, another rule may not be surpris ing to us In that case it is desirable to additionally prune the latter rule to focus the user\222s attention on those rules that are interesting The pruning process that follows builds upon several existing techniques 2 111 Consider rules X  y and rule X\222  y, where X\222 is a sub set of X If we know the confidence c\222 for rule X\222  y then we expect the confidence for rule X  y to also be c\221 since there is no reason to believe  without prior knowl edge of the library and/or applications  that the additional items X-X\222 in the antecedent are likely to increasefdecrease the occurrence of y. Thus we shall consider pruning X  y if its confidence c is not much greater than c\221 More specifically we set an interest threshold 6 and prune any such rule X  y where c%/c\221  6 If it is not pruned we say that X  y is interesting with respect to X\222  y We also perform anotherform of pruning Suppose we have two rules X  y and X 3  where X is an ancestor of itemset X contqning the same number of items \(where 223an cestor\224 means X  X as defined in Section 2 or Q is an ancestor of y or both In such a cye we may keep the more specific rule X  y and prune X 3 6 Generally speaking we would like to show the more specific rule which tends to be more informative However we may also wish to show the more general rule if its confidence is much greater than expected If X  y has confidence c then X  y has expected confidence c since there is no reason to believe without prior knowledge, that y is more/less likely to be in a trans action with X than one with X However as  is an an cestor of y the rule X   clearly has confidence c and possibly much more To get a reasonable estimate for ex pected support we shall assume prior knowledge of the rel ative support of y and  With such knowledge we would expect X  Q to have y  c since of those transactions that support X we would expect supp\(Q y of them to support Q By the first observation X  y has expected confidence-c Given the confidence c for X  y we would expect X   to have y  c as explained above Consequently we prune the rule X  ij if and only if supp~~~~~upp~y~~~c  6 for some interest threshold 6 Finally combining this analysis with our earlier results on smaller antecedents X\222 we shall prune a rule X  ij given confidence c\222 for X\222  y if and only if  6 This follows because the ex pected confidence for X  y is the same as the confidence c\222 for X\222  y Now we are ready to describe the complete pruning proce dure Given a set of rules XI  y1    X  yn we first construct a partial order with a node for each rule The nodes in the partial order are ordered as follows Xi  yi  Xj  yj if and only if 1 the rules are not identical 2 0 E Xi C Xj and 3 X is more specific than or equal to Xj and y is a descendent of or equal to yj Pruning proceeds by considering the nodes of the partial or der in topological sort order That is, an ancestor is always processed before its descendents In this process a rule X  y is not pruned if and only if it is &interesting with respect to all ancestors in the partial order that have survived the pruning process to that point 4 BROWSING REUSE PATTERNS In this section we shall demonstrate how one might browse and learn from generalized association rules by considering code written for the KDE desktop environment. The KDE li braries provide a C application framework for developing GUI applications. In our experiment we have mined reuse patterns for the KDE 1.1.2 core libraries \(which include the Qt toolkit by analyzing 76 real-life applications Specifically, we have used our tool CodeWeb to mine for generalized association rules with confidence of at least 10 and support of at least 15 transactions There were 1365 transactions total so the support requirement as a percentage is about 1.1 The global pruning parameters were set at y  1.25 and X  0.01 The local pruning parameter 6 was set to 1.25 Only rules with one item in the antecedent and one item in the consequent were considered To contrast generalized association rule mining with our ear lier work on standard association rule mining we also in clude the data mining results where inheritance was ignored all together On a Sparc Ultra 1 mining generalized asso ciation rules took about 50 minutes while mining standard E supp~g~~supp~y~~~c E 173 


association rules took 20 minutes The rule statistics are as follows Rules Global Pruning Mined Uninteresting Misleading Insignificant Generalized 5 1308 13299 1904 6681 Standard 21594 996 320 978 Rules Left 34271 19636 Observe that while the number of rules mined by generalized association rules is significantly more than that using stan dard association rules a greater percentage of these rules is eliminated during global pruning Of course the number of rules pruned locally varied depending upon the local context and is not shown here Typically a developer just starting out with a library would identify important library classes and browse their reuse pat terns By 223important\224 we mean those library classes that are reused in many existing applications and are thus likely to be relevant in new applications also For example, a developer using our tool would notice that the KDE classes KApplica tion and QObject are reused in 99 and loo respectively of the 76 applications mined  and are thus essential in any KDE application We consider the reuse patterns for these two classes in what follows KApplication Reuse Patterns Figure 3 shows all reuse patterns predicated on the instanti ation of KApplication in an application class The support ers of a rule are those application classes for which all rule items apply For example, an application class that supports reuse pattern 1 must instantiate KApplication and calls its member function exec We also show the detractors of a rule which are those application classes for which the an tecedent items apply but where the consequent item does not hold For example, an application class that detracts from reuse pattern 1 must instantiate KApplication and not call exec Our tool allows users to browse the source code for both supporters and detractors of reuse patterns these ap plication classes illustrate characteristic and uncharacteristic reuse respectively In Figure 3 we find  among other things  that of those applications classes that instantiate the KApplication class 72.3 call its member function exec 58.5 instantiate KT~pLevelWidget 53.8 call the member function set Mainwidget of the class KApplication and 46.2 call the show member of the class KTopLevelWidget Re call that the symbol 221A\222 indicates that some application class may reuse a strict descendent of KTopLevelWidget rather than the class itself By browsing reuse patterns in combination with library ref erence documentation which is usually available\and appli cation source code a developer can learn to use a library by example in much the same way as studying manually con structed tutorials and/or toy programs both of which may not be available For example, doing this for the rules in Figure 3 reveals that the class KApplication instantiated in the main function of most KDE applications manages the application event queue We also observe that applications inherit from KTo pLevelWidget to define the main widget of the application e.g one that is not contained in any other this widget is then instantiated and a call to setMainWidget0 tells the li brary that whenever the user closes this widget that the appli cation should terminate all together Afterwards the exec member of KApplication is called to enter the main event Finally it turns out that all applications that instantiate KTo pLevelWidget always instantiate a descendent that they de fine Without taking into account the inheritance hierarchy e.g using generalized association rules we would miss reuse patterns involving this class all together QObject Reuse Patterns The class QObject is an ancestor of almost all classes in the KDE libraries According to the reference documentation this class provides facilities for event handling and timing operations Figure 4 shows some of the reuse patterns re ported by our tool for QObject of the 53 rules found for this class 47 involve a 221*\222 symbol in the antecedent and/or consequent It turns out that application classes rarely reuse QObject directly; typically they reuse it indirectly through one of its descendents Although QObject is very funda mental to the KDE libraries only six rules would have been found without taking into account the inheritance hierarchy 5 RELATEDWORK In this paper we have looked for pattems in the way library classes have been reused in practice by existing applications In this section we shall talk about several related techniques Exemplars An exemplar is an executable visual model consisting of one or more instances of at least one concrete class for each ab stract class in a library 6 By browsing these classes as well as their static relationships and dynamic interactions one can get a general understanding of how the framework works in a small example While an exemplar may be helpful it is a pre-selected toy example that may not be representative of 223real-life\224 appli cations Moreover, exemplars place an extra burden on the developers of the software library In contrast our approach allows the user to browse reuse patterns and the correspond ing supporter and detractor classes in real-life applications Moreover, the tool is automated and works on any existing code Reengineering Libraries Recently research has been done on reengineering libraries by analyzing their usage in several existing applications lo This is done by constructing a lattice that provides insights loop 174

into the usage of the class hierarchy in a specific context Such a lattice can be used to reengineer the library class hi erarchy to better reflect standard usage In contrast we are interested in helping novice users learn to use a library to write new applications  not reengineer the library itself This different perspective has led us to 1\initiate a new search direction for mining code for the purposes of illus trating characteristic code reuse 2 use data mining tech niques that scale to a hundred or more applications  not just a few examples for which confidence and support mea sures would not be meaningful 3 look for different kinds of reuse patterns that are more helpful for demonstrating reuse of the library classes and 4 construct a tool whose user in terface is aimed at users of a software library rather than its developers Other Work involving Data Mining Researchers have used data mining and related techniques for a variety of purposes. For example, data mining has been used to discover likely program invariants infer spec ifications in software 3 and decompose a software sys tem into data cohesive subsystems to assist developers with reengineering and maintenance tasks 4 The last of these is the only other work we are aware of that uses association rule mining in the software engineering domain 6 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this paper, we have shown how data mining can be used to discover library reuse patterns in existing applications Specifically we considered the problem of discovering li brary classes and member functions that are typically reused in combination by application classes This paper improves upon our earlier research using \223associ ation rules\224  by taking into account the inheritance hier archy using \223generalized association rules\224 This has turned out to be non-trivial due to the significantly larger number of rules that arise as a result Consequently, pruning is impor tant and we showed several ways in which it can be done By browsing generalized association rules a developer can discover patterns in library usage in a way that takes into ac count inheritance relationships We have illustrated the ap proach using our tool CodeWeb by demonstrating charac teristic ways in which applications reuse classes in the KDE application framework We have observed that some impor tant rules would not have been found without taking into ac count the inheritance hierarchy I One can view our general approach to mining reuse patterns as learning from positive experience That is, library reuse that has worked in practice Presumably, one would se lect 223stable\224 applications to demonstrate reuse patterns in a library However one can also mine negative experi ence That is misunderstandings and problems that came up when reusing components from a software library For future work it would be interesting to determine if one can  mine negative experience in an automated way perhaps by analyzing application CVS logs for reuse patterns that were problematic and later corrected REFERENCES  11 R Agrawal and R Srikant Fast algorithms for mining association rules In Proceedings of the 20th Very Large Data Bases Conference pages 487499,1994 2 M Chen J Han and P S Yu Data mining An overview from a database perspective ZEEE Transac tions on Knowledge and Data Engineering 8\(6 883,1996 3 W W Cohen.

Such a small mod ification to the original HPA algorithm could improve the linearity substantially 4.6 Effect of increasing transaction Figure 13 shows the effect of increasing transac tion database sue as the number of transactions is increased from 256,000 to 2 million transactions We used the data set t15.14 The behavior of the results does not change with increased database size The minimum support value was set to 0.4 The num ber of processors is kept at 16 As shown each of the parallel algorithms attains linearity 5 Summary and related work In this paper we proposed four parallel algorithms for mining association rules A summary of the four database size Sizeup 0 I 0 500 loo0 1500 uxw amount of transaction thousands Figure 13 Sizeup curve algorithms is shown in Table 5 In NPA the candi date itemsets are just copied amongst all the proces sors Each processor works on the entire candidate itemsets NPA requires no data transfer when the supports are counted However in the case where the entire candidate itemsets do not fit within the mem ory of a single processor the candidate itemsets are divided and the supports are counted by scanning the transaction database repeatedly Thus Disk 1/0 cost of NPA is high PDM, proposed in 6 is the same as NPA which copies the candidate itemsets among all the processors Disk 1/0 for PDM should be also high The remaining three algorithms SPA HPA and HPA-ELD partition the candidate itemsets over the memory space of all the processors Because it better exploits the total system's memory, disk 1/0 cost is low SPA arbitrarily partitions the candidate itemsets equally among the processors Since each processor broadcasts its local transaction data to all other pro cessors the communication cost is high HPA and HPA-ELD partition the candidate itemsets using a hash function which eliminates the need for transac tion data broadcasting and can reduce the comparison workload significantly HPA-ELD detects frequently occurring itemsets and handles them separately which can reduce the influence of the workload skew 6 Conclusions Since mining association rules requires several scans of the transaction file its computational requirements are too large for a single processor to have a reasonable response time This motivates our research In this paper we proposed four different parallel algorithms for mining association rules on a shared nothing parallel machine and examined their viabil 29 


Table 5 characteristics of algorithms ity through implementation on a 64 node parallel ma chine the Fujitsu AP1000DDV If a single processor can hold all the candidate item sets parallelization is straightforward It is just suf ficient to partition the transaction over the proces sors and for each processor to process the allocated transaction data in parallel We named this algo rithm NPA However when we try to do large scale data mining against a very large transaction file the candidate itemsets become too large to fit within the main memory of a single processor In addition to the size of a transaction file a small minimum support also increases the size of the candidate itemsets As we decrease the minimum support computation time grows rapidly but in many cases we can discover more interesting association rules SPA HPA and HPA-ELD not only partition the transaction file but partition the candidate itemsets among all the processors We implemented these al gorithms on a shard-nothing parallel machine Per formance evaluations show that the best algorithm HPA-ELD attains good linearity on speedup by fully utilizing all the available memory space which is also effective for skew handling At present we are doing the parallelization of mining generalized association rules described in 9 which includes the taxonomy is-a hierarchy Each item belongs to its own class hierarchy In such mining associations between the higher class and the lower class are also examined Thus the candidate itemset space becomes much larger and its computation time also takes even longer than the naive single level association mining Parallel pro cessing is essential for such heavy mining processing Acknowledgments This research is partially supported as a priority research program by ministry of education We would like to thank the F\221ujitsu Parallel Computing Research Center for allowing us to use their APlOOODDV sys tems References l R.Agrawal T.Imielinski and ASwami 223Min ing Association Rules between Sets of Items in Large Databases\224 In Proc of the 1993 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Manage ment of Data pp207-216 May 1993 2 R.Agrawal and RSrikant 223Fast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules\224 In Proc of the 20th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases pp.487-499 September 1994 3 J.S.Park M.-S.Chen and P.S.Yu 223An Effec tive Hash-Based Algorithm for Mining Associ ation Rules\224 In Proc of the 1995 ACM SIG MOD International Conference on the Manage ment of Data SIGMOD Record Vo1.24 pp.175 186 June 1995 4 H.Mannila H.Toivonen and A.I.Verkamo 223Ef ficient Algorithms for Discovering Association Rules\224 In KDD-94:AAAI Workshop on Knowl edge Discovery in Databases pp.181-192 July 1994 5 A.Savasere, E.Omiecinski and S.Navathe 223An Effective Algorithm for Mining Association Rules in Large Databases\224 In Proc of the 21th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases pp.432-444 September 1995 6 J.S.Park M.-S.Chen and P.S.Yu 223Efficient Parallel Data Mining for Association Rules\224 In Proc of the 4th International Conference on In formation and Knowledge Management pp.31 36 November 1995 7 T.Shintani and M.Kitsuregawa 223Considera tion on Parallelization of Database Mining\224 In Institute of Electronics Information and Com munication Engineering Japan SIG CPS Y95 88 Technical Report Vo1.95 No.47 pp.57-62 December 1995 8 T.Shimizu T.Horie and H.Ishihata 223Perfor mance Evaluation of the APlOOO Effects of message handling broadcast and barrier syn chronization on benchmark performance-\224  In S WO PP 22292 9.2 ARC 95 Information Processing Society of Japan Vo1.92 No.64 1992 9 R.Srikant and R.Agrawal 223Mining Generalized Association Rules\224 In Proc of the 21th Inter national Conference on Very Large Data Bases pp.407-419 September 1995 30
