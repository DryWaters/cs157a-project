Genetic programming GP usual1-v has a wide search space and a highj7exibility So GP may search for global optimum solution. But in general, GP s learning speed is not so fast Apriori Algorithm is one of association rule algorithms It can he applied to 1aTe database But It is dzjicult to define itsparameters without experience We propose a rule generation technique from a database using GP combined with association rule algorithm 
It takes rules generated bv the association rule algorithm as initial individual of Gfl The learning speed of GP is improved by the combined algorithm To verih the eflectiveness of the proposed method, we apply it to the decision tree construction problem from UCI Machine Learning Repository We compare the result of proposed method with prior ones 1 Introduction Various techniques are proposed for the construction 
of the decision tree using classification learning In general the learning speed of a system using a ge netic programming is slow Moreover both prob lem background knowledge and design skill are de manded of the system designer However a learning system which can acquire higherader knowledge by adjusting to the environment can be constructed be cause the structure is treated at the same time On the other hand there is the Apriori algorithm 
as a rule generating techruque from a large database It is one of association rule construction algorithms. The Apriori algorithm uses two values a support value and a confidence value Depending on the setting of each index threshold. the search space can be re duced and the number of association rule candidate can be increased However the experience is needed for setting an effective threshold Each technique has advantages and disadvantages like this 
In this paper we propose the decision tree construction technique ftom database using genetic programming combined with association rule algo rithms By the learning method of the combined rule generation technique it is expected the construction of the system which can search for a flexible decision tree from a large database To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method 0-7803-6400-7/00/$10.00 02000 IEEE I46 we discuss the learning method 
by genetic program ming combined with the association rule construc tion method by the Apriori algorithm and the auto matically defined function technique We apply it to the decision tree construction problem from UCI Ma chine Learning Repository We compare the result of proposed method with prior ones 2 Algorithm of Association Rule Construction In the association rule analysis each case generally targets the transaction form data The transaction form data is item set as a minimum 
unit of the data description CO-occurence pattem among item sets in the case is extracted as an association rule 1 is one of association rule samples The association rule ex presses as co-occurence pattem of the item set in the case data 1 21 B+H R is condtion part of associahon rule I1 is conclusion part of associatlon rule 


Fourth International Conference on knowledge-Based Intelligent Engineering Systems b Allied Technologies 30\222\222 Aug-IY Slept 2000 Brighton,UK 2.1 Apriori Algorithm By the ordinary analysis technique a lot of calcula tion time needs to extract the association rule from a large database The Apriori algorithm can extract the association de from a large database by achieving the high efficiency of the search in realistic time In the Apriori algorithm the candidate of the association rule is evaluated by using two values support value and confidence value, while searching for the associ ation rules The support value of association rule R r~p R is defined as 2 The confidence value of association rule R sup R is defined as 3  R U H means a number of cases containing both R and H items SV means a number of all cases TI R U H means a number of cases contammg both f and U items n n means a number of cases contalnmg B items The Apriori algorithm, for support value and confi dence value is used minimum support value and min imum confidence value as those thresholds If a can didate of association rule cannot fill these minimum values, we assume that its rule expresses low associ ation Then its rule is excluded evaluation to reduce search space consecutively Therefore the Apriori al gorithm can search faster than the other association rule analysis techniques By operating each minimum value the candidate number of association rule can be increased or the range of the search space can be reduced However it is possible that an unexpected rule cannot be ex tracted by reducing the range of the search space Moreover, the load of the expert who analyzes the rule increases when there are a lot of association rule candidates, and it is a possible that it becomes diffi cult to search for a useful rule 3 Genetic Programming Genetic programming GP is a learning method based on the natural theory of evolution, and the flow of the algorithm is similar to genetic algorithm GA The difference between GP and GA is that GP has extended its chromosome to allow structural expres sion using function nodes and terminal nodes F31 In this paper, the tree structure is used to express the de cision tree Therefore we express the decision tree by using each attribute value and the class name as the terminal node and the condition sentence as the function node 3.1 The Algorithm of GP The decision tree construction with GP follows the following procedures 1 2 3 4 3.2 An initial population is generated from a random gammar of the function nodes and the terminal nodes defined for each problem domain The fitness value which relates to the problem solving ability for each individual of the GP population is calculated The next generation is generate\222d by genetic op erations a The individual is copied by fitness value b A new individual is generated by intersec c A new individual is generated by random reproduction tion \(crossover change mu tat ion If the termination condition is met, then the pro cess exits Otherwise the process repeats from the calculation of fitness value in step 2 Automatically Defined1 Function Ordinarily there is no method of adequately con trolling the growth of the tree because GP does not evaluate the size of the tree Therefore dur ing the search process the tree ma.y become overly deep and complex or may settle to a too simple tree There has been research on methods to have the program define functions itself for efficient use One of the approaches is automatic function defini tion or Automatically Defined Function: ADF\and this is achieved by adding the gene expression for the function definition to normal GP l4.1 By implement ing ADF a more compact program can be produced and the number of generation cycles can be reduced More than one ADF can be defined in one individual 141

Next process the conclusion part of the association rule puts on the terminal node of tlus route Finally con cerning the terminal nodes whch are not defmed by the association rule they are assigned the candidates at random ADF-GP Apriori  ADF-GP 5 Apply to Decision Tree Con struction from Database 98.0 92.9 9 2 235 To verify the valihty of the proposed method, we ap plied the method to an evaluation experiment For evaluation data we used house-votes data from UCI Machine Learning Repository 51 By using this eval uation database we compared the results of the pro posed method with prior ones The evaluation data contains 16 attributes and 2 classes The attributes are for example \223handicapped-infants\224 and 223\222water project-cost-sharing 224 etc They are expressed by 3 values And the 2 classes are 223democrat\224 and 223republican 224 50 cases out of the total 435 data of house-votes were used for training data The following GP parameters were used Re fer to table 1  223y 224 223n\224 and 224\222 At first we extracted the association rule from the database by the Apriori algorithm We applied the Table 1 Parameters of GP GP population i 500 Reorduction orobabilitv 1 0.1 Selection method Tournament method Function node IFEQ ADFO ADFl Tenninal node Attribute value of database I I 16 attributes y n  1 dcmocratmublican Number of training data Number of test data IFEQ ifequal to I ADFO ADFl the function detinition gene expanded by ADF y n  yes\(y no others I democrat:3 1 republican 19 I 435 Apriori algorithm to a data set excluding data with the 223?\224 value, because 223?\223 value means 223others\224 In the following experiment we experimented by using minimum support value  30 and minimum cod dence value  90 As a result of the experiment 75 rules were generated Next we constructed the decision tree from the database For decision tree construction we used learning by normal ADF-GP and learning by ADF GP which took the association rule as an initial in vidual In this combined GP 75 rules generated with the association rule were taken into the initial individ ual The result of the transition of each fitness value is shown in figure 1 and the result of best individual is shown in table 2 By using normal ADF-GP inference accuracy did not rise easily However, the proposed method showed fast learning, and achieved high accuracy Compar ing the best indwidual results the proposed method showed better results than normal ADF-GP except for accuracy against the training data See genera tion 100  300 in figure l  Concerning the training data results normal ADF-GP may have shown over fitting But its proof could not be obtained by the result Table 2 Experiment Best Individuals Result by Each Technique 748

US Coast Guard approved personal floatation devices must be supplied and inspected where employees are engaged in work where there is danger of drowning Required employee protection in public work areas to include the following  Warning signs or flags and other traffic control devices  Barricades for additional protection to employees  Barricades around excavated areas  Warning lights at night prominently displayed Lines or equipment which may be sub to backfeed from cogeneration or other sources are to be worked as energized in accordance with the applicable paragraphs of the Rules Comments w APPA submits the following comments regarding this Special Conditions section Recommends that the wording regarding capacitors be modified to include a waiting period for five minutes prior to short circuiting and grounding in accordance with industry standards for discharging of capacitors For series street light circuits, recommends that language be added for bridging to either install a bypass conductor or by placement of grounds so that work occurs between the grounds Recommends modification of the section regarding personal floatation devices to not apply to work sites near fountains decorative ponds swimming pools or other bodies of water on residential and commercial property Definitions x This section of the proposed Rules includes definitions of terms Definitions particularly pertinent to understanding the proposal and which have not previously been included are listed as follows Authorized Employee  an employee to whom the authority and responsibility to perform a specific assignment has been given by the employer who can demonstrate by experience or training the ability to recognize potentially hazardous energy and its potential impact on the work place conditions and who has the knowledge to implement adequate methods and means for the control and isolation of such energy CZearance for Work  Authorization to perform specified work or permission to enter a restricted area Clearance from Hazard  Separation from energized lines or equipment Comments x The following summarizes the changes in some of the definitions which APPA recommends Add to the definition for authorized employee It the authorized employee may be an employee assigned to perform the work or assigned to provide the energy control and isolation function  Recommends that OSHA modify the definition for a line clearance tree trimmer to add the word qualified resulting in the complete designation as a qualified line clearance tree trimmer Recommends that OSHA modify the definition of qualified employee" to remove the word construction from the definition since it is felt that knowledge of construction procedures is beyond the scope of the proposed rule resulting in APPA's new A2-18 I 


wording as follows more knowledgeable in operation and hazards associated with electric power generation transmission and/or distribution equipment Recommends that OSHA add a definition for the word practicable and replace the word feasible with practicable wherever it appears in the proposed regulations and that practicable be further defined as capable of being accomplished by reasonably available and economic means OTHER ISSUES Clothing OSHA requested comments on the advisability of adopting requirements regarding the clothing worn by electric utility industry employees EEI has presented comments which indicates research is underway prior to establishing a standard for clothing to be worn by electric utility employees However EEI's position is that this standard has not developed to the extent that it could be included in the OSHA Rules Both APPA and EEI state that they would support a requirement that employers train employees regarding the proper type of clothing to wear to minimize hazards when working in the vicinity of exposed energized facilities Grandfathering Due to the anticipated cost impact on the utility industry of the proposed Rules requiring that existing installations be brought to the requirements of the proposed Rules both APPA and EEI propose that the final Rules include an omnibus grandfather provision This provision would exempt those selected types of facilities from modification to meet the new rules EEI states that if the grandfathering concept is incorporated that electric utility employees will not be deprived of proper protection They propose that employers be required to provide employees with a level of protection equivalent to that which the standard would require in those instances in which the utility does not choose to modify existing facilities to comply with the final standard Rubber Sleeves OSHA requests comments from the industry on whether it would be advisable to require rubber insulating sleeves when gloves are used on lines or equipment energized at more than a given voltage EEI states its position that utilities should continue to have the option of choosing rubber gloves or gloves and sleeves to protect employees when it is necessary to work closer to energized lines than the distances specified in the clearance tables Preemuting State Laws EEI requests that the final Rules be clear in their preempting state rules applicable to the operation and maintenance work rules for electric power systems. This is especially critical since some states now have existing laws which are more stringent than the proposed OSHA Rules Examples are 1 in California and Pennsylvania where electric utility linemen are prohibited from using rubber gloves to work on lines and equipment energized at more than certain voltages and 2 in California and Connecticut where the live line bare hand method of working on high voltage transmission systems is prohibited One utility Pacific Gas  Electric has obtained a variance from the California OSHA to perform live line bare-hand transmission maintenance work on an experimental basis Coiiflicts Between the Rilles and Part 1926 Subpart V Since many of the work procedures in construction work and operation and maintenance work are similar and difficult to distinguish between EEI requests that the final order be clear in establishing which rule has jurisdiction over such similar work areas A2-19 v 


IMPACTS ON COSTS AND ASSOCIATED BENEFITS In its introduction to the proposed rules OSHA has provided an estimate of the annual cost impact on the electric utility industry for the proposed des of approximately 20.7 million OSHA estimates that compliance with this proposed standard would annually prevent between 24 and 28 fatalities and 2,175 injuries per year The utilities which have responded to this proposed standard through their respective associations have questioned the claims both of the magnitude of the cost involved and the benefit to the industry in preventing fatalities and lost-time injuries Both EEI and APPA feel that the annual cost which OSHA estimates are significantly lower than would be realized in practice Factors which APPA and EEI feel were not properly addressed include the following OSHA has not accurately accounted for cost of potential retroactive impacts including retrofitting and modifying existing installations and equipment OSHA has not consistently implemented performance based provisions in proposed rules  many portions require specific approaches which would require utilities to replace procedures already in place with new procedures Estimates were based on an average size investor-owned utility of 2,800 employees and an average rural cooperative of 56 employees, which are not applicable to many smaller systems such as municipal systems OSHA has not adequately addressed the retraining which would be necessary with modifying long-established industry practices to be in accordance with the OSHA rules EEI claims that OSHA's proposed clearance requirements would not allow the use of established maintenance techniques for maintaining high voltage transmission systems and thus would require new techniques For an example of the cost which is estimated to be experienced as a result of the new Rules one of the EEI member companies has estimated that approximately 20,000 transmission towers would need to be modified to accommodate the required step bolts in the Rules at an estimated cost of 6,200,000 Additionally this same company estimates that the annual cost of retesting live line tools for its estimated 1,000 tools would be 265,000 Additionally, both EEI and APPA question the additional benefits which OSHA claims would result from implementation of the new Rules APPA questions the estimates of preventing an additional 24 to 28 fatalities annually and 2,175 injuries per year in that it fails to account for the fact that the industry has already implemented in large part safety measures which are incorporated in the Rules EEI and APPA also point out that many preventable injuries cannot be eliminated despite work rules enforcement and safety awareness campaigns since many such accidents which result in fatalities are due to employee being trained but not following the employer's training and policies PRESENT STATUS OF RULES According to information received from the OSHA office in February 1993 the final Rules are to be published no later than July 1993 and possibly as soon as March 1993 OSHA closed their receipt of comments in March 1991 and no further changes in the rules are thought possible A2-20 


CONCLUSION The OSHA 1910.269 which proposes to cover electric utility operation and maintenance work rules affects a multitude of working procedures as are summarized in this paper It is not possible at the present time to assess the final structure of the Rules as may be proposed in 1993 or subsequent years Since the comments from the utility associations APPA and EEI were made following the initial release of the proposed OSHA Rules in 1989 a significant amount of time has elapsed where other events have occurred which may affect the form of the final Rules The 1993 NESC went into effect in August 1992 and includes some of the requirements to which the commenters objected For example a significant requirement in the Part 4 of the 1993 NESC requires that rubber gloves be utilized on exposed energized parts of facilities operating at 50 to 300 volts This requirement is in conflict with EEl\222s proposed change to the OSHA Rules which would still allow working such secondary facilities without the use of rubber gloves Electric utilities are advised to review the January 31 1989 proposed operation and maintenance Rules as summarized in this paper and to review their procedures which would be affected by application of the Rules Many of the procedures proposed in the Rules provide valuable guidance in electric utilities\222 operation and maintenance activities Where the cost impact is not significant, it is recommended that utilities consider implementing such procedures in expectation of the Rules being published in the next few months Also it would be appropriate for electric utilities to review the 1993 edition of the NESC since there are portions of the Rules which have resulted in changes in the NESC These changes mainly occur in Part 4 Rules for the Operation of Electric Supply and Communications Lines and Equipment The concerns which the commenters have addressed regarding the cost impact and the resulting benefits experienced as a result of the promulgation of the Rules are real ones and must be addressed in the final Rules As a result this paper cannot present a conclusion regarding the full impact of the Rules The development of such Rules continue to be an ongoing matter and will undoubtedly require later analysis when the final rules are published A2-21
