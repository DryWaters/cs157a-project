In this paper an online sequential extreme learning machine \(OSELM\gorithm adopted as training procedure for wavelet network based on serial-parallel nonlinear autoregressive exogenous \(NARX\ model. The proposed model used as system identification for nonlinear dynamic systems. The main advantage of OSELM over conventional algorithms is the ability of updating network weights sequentially through data sample-by-sample in a single learning step. This attains good performance at extremely fast learning. The initial kernel parameters of WN played a big role to ensure fast and better learning performance. Simulation of the proposed scheme applied to nonlinear dynamic systems validates that WN-OSELM is superior in terms of identification accuracy and fast learning ability compared to NN-OSELM Keywords\227 Neural Network \(NN\, Extreme Learning Machine ELM\, Nonlinear ARX Model, Waveleons, Dilation, Translation  I   I NTRODUCTION  Wavelet network is an ordinary feed-forward neural network with wavelet functions in the hidden layer nodes.

Note that this system has fast dynamic response yet WN was capable to extract plant dynamics  Fig. 2  WN and NN based OS-ELM for Magnetic Levitation system B  Continuous  Stirred Tank Reactor \(CSTR The dynamics of the CSTR system can describe by     where l  t is the fluid level r  t the concentration result at the output 1  t e flow rate of first liquid feed source with concentration C 1 24.9, and 2  t is the flow rate of the second feed with concentrations C 2 0.1. Similarly, the simulation result in Figure 3 displayed that, WN much better than NN where the best fits was 91.66 %, while NN shows 80.13 Note that NN suffers from sharp discontinuity ends, while WN with decompositions properties a superb estimate capability with sharp discontinuities system responses C  Robot Arm The system consists of a single-link robot arm that controls the movement of the arm.

However, the simulation result in Figure 4 shows better best fit and good estimation with 99.66 % for WN and 95.45 for NN. Note that WN still higher  Fig. 3  WN and NN based OS-ELM for CSTR system  Fig. 4  WN and NN based OS-ELM for Robot Arm system For more investigation on stability performance,  the training errors are shown in Figure 5 for the robot arm system; it is obvious that the error decline gradually for the NN with none soothe convergence rippling with each training sample unlike WN, where it was stable all the line  As a result from previous tests, it is obvious that WN can offer excellent approximation ability turn out to be factual even for functions with sharp discontinuities   Fig. 5  The Training errors for Robot Arm system Stage 2 : Network Size The simulations are applied to the three dynamic systems with different numbers of neurons and waveleons in the hidden layers, while the numbers of regressors are fixed in all tests and the trained data are fed sample by sample K 1\. On behalf of that, a comparison illustrated according to training time and normalized mean square error \(NMSE\ and tested with 7, 15 and 25 numbers of hidden nodes. For the first evaluation with 7 hidden nodes, Table1 shows that WN is less NMSE error and more training time than NN for all systems, where WN is taking more time in about 0.1- 0.2 seconds TABLE I  TRAINING TIME AND NORMALIZED MSE FOR 7 HIDDEN NODES OF WN AND NN BASED OS-ELM Magnetic Levitation CSTR Robot Arm NN WN NN WN NN WN Training Time second  0.1248 0.3120 0.3744 0.4368 0.2340 0.4212 NMSE 0.1426 0.0023 0.1528 0.0661 0.0244 0.0018 Sam les Out put s     63 0 NN  500 0.02 Sam 615 620 625 0 02 0 04 0 06     Plant 006\212 500 Plant WN Best Fit NN = 95.47 WN= 99.66 WN  les Outputs       23 1   t   t    2 1 2 1 1 tr tr tl trC tl trC dt trd NN  006\212 006\212 200 800 1200 1800 0.2 Samples NN  NN   200 1000 Samples Outputs       600 1200 Plant Best Fit NN = 80.13 WN= 91.66 0 400 800 1400 1600 1800 2000 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  212\006\212+\006\212 24   2   \\(\(sin10   2 2 T dt tdm tm dt tmd WN  1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 19.5 20 20.5 21 21.5 22 22.5 23 610 635 0 02 400 1600 0.4 0.2 0.4 0.6 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.1 0.12 0.14  Trai ni ng Error  0.04 600 1000 1400 2000 0 p   0 p   0 0   0 0 0   22\                                       \\(.20   21 tlt t dt tld 0 04 1 WN  


The same results obtained in Table2 for 15 hidden nodes where WN shows better accuracy but not much difference than NN. The enhancement in training time of WN is clear where the differences reduced within 0.01- 0.1 seconds, meaning that WN with prior initializing tries to find optimality due to number of waveleons TABLE II  TRAINING TIME AND NORMALIZED MSE FOR 15 HIDDEN NODES OF WN AND NN BASED OS-ELM Magnetic Levitation CSTR Robot Arm NN WN NN WN NN WN Training Time second  0.5148 0.5616 1.1076 0.9516 1.0920 1.0764 NMSE 0.0746 0.0601 0.0825 0.0353 0.0074 0.0069 In Table3 for 25 hidden nodes, WN shows better NMSE in robot arm and CSTR systems with less learning time comparing to NN in all three systems. This means that WN reached almost optimal waveleon numbers with robot arm and CSTR systems. However, NN showed better identification accuracy then WN in magnetic levitation system, and this could be the reason of over fitting tricky of WN with larger number of waveleons than the optimal number TABLE III  TRAINING TIME AND NORMALIZED MSE FOR 25 HIDDEN NODES OF WN AND NN BASED OS-ELM Magnetic Levitation CSTR Robot Arm NN WN NN WN NN WN Training Time second  0.9204 0.5772 1.5288 0.9984 1.5132 1.1700 NMSE 0.0136 0.0601 0.0390 0.0353 0.0106 0.0069 From the above results, it\222s clear that WN is less sensitive to the network size than NN and the reason is a good initialization procedure for wavelet parameters, while the initialization of NN done randomly. Moreover, the wavelets decomposition propriety helped WN to approximate output of the plants precisely giving better identification of the system dynamics On the other hand, the time consuming for training varied with number of hidden nodes, and WN reached optimal performance in best fit and training time with specific number of waveleons no matter what size it is. In another word, WN is able to spend less training time than NN if the number of waveleons is chosen correctly  V  C ONCLUSION  Wavelet Network based on fixed structure serial-parallel NARX model with online sequential extreme learning machine has been applied to nonlinear dynamic systems as system identification scheme. The OSELM algorithm is adopted as training algorithm for wavelet network Simulations have been carried out with proposed model on three nonlinear dynamic systems. The updating weights was done online sequentially, sample-by-sample and, for all the simulated dynamic systems.  The results show fast learning ability with good system identification accuracy for WNOSELM preserving better stability and convergence over NNOSELM in most tests.  The overall results show better acceptable training time, and could be applied in real time applications if real input and output observations are available  However, further investigation is required in order to implement the algorithm experimentally, since selecting the number of hidden nodes \(waveleons\ acts as a big rule in WNOSELM training time, because it may lead to fatal estimations and much more time consuming  R EFERENCES  1  A  S ur e s hba bu an d J  F a r r e l l  W av ele tb ased identification for nonlinearcontrol," IEEE Trans Autom Control, vol. 44, p. 412\2267., 1999 2  S  A  Bil l ing s an d H  L  W e i A  N e w cl as s o f  w a v e l e t ne t w o r ks f o r nonlinear system identi 336 cation," IEEE Trans neural networks, vol. 16 pp. 862-874, 2005 3  A  Rubaa i an d R  K o tar u  O nl ine ide n t i f i c a t i o n a nd co ntr o l o f a D C  motor using learning adaptation of neural networks," IEEE Indusrial Applications, vol. 3, no. 36, pp. 935-942, 2000  P L  G u op i n g K  Vi s a ka n and  B  St eve On li n e id en ti fic a ti on o f  nonlinear systems using Volterra polynomia lbasis function neural networks," Neural Networks , no. 11, p. 1645\2261657, 1998 5  Y  T a n, D  X u an j u L   F e ng and S   Ch u n Y i D y n am ic w a v e le t ne ur al  network for nonlinear dynamic system identification," in International IEEE Conference on Control Applications, Anchorage, AK, 2000 6 G  B  Hu a n g Q  Y Z h u  a n d  C  K  Si e w  Ext re me  le a r n i n g  machine:Theorey and applications," Neurocomput, p. 489\226501 2006 7  G  B H u ang  D  H  W a ng and Y  L a n E x t r e m e le ar ning m a ch ine s  a survey," Int.

  12 panel chair agrees with the approach he or she recommends it for approval to the PSRP. After many tweaks and focused discussion outside of the full PSRP the OPALS CBCS matrix was approved for Phase 2 As Phase 3 approaches, all agreed-to verifications of hazard controls must be performed, documented, and submitted Any deviations from the agreed-to verifications must be documented and approved by members of the PSRP In addition to the Flight Safety Reviews \(FSRs\und Safety Review schedule is also negotiated and a package is submitted.  This process is very similar to the PSRP one, but the scope of the hazards is limited to ground operations at the launch and processing facilities The key to successfully passing the FSRs has been constant early, and open communication with the PSRP. It has allowed for the quick identification of hazards and it has prevented the project from locking itself into designs that either could have adversely impacted safety or could have made compliance significantly more difficult. The PSRP and everyone involved in the safety side of the interface have shown great flexibility in allowing OPALS design freedom to ensure its mission success while enforcing a high standard for the safety of the ISS and those inhabiting it 5  D RIVERS   C ONSTRAINTS  AND R ESULTING I MPLEMENTATION  OPALS is no exception when it comes to facing the typical challenges that most space flight projects have to overcome throughout their lifecycle. Cost and schedule always seem insufficient. The workforce is sometimes stretched thin. All these challenges create constraints, end up driving the decision-making process and inescapably shape the final product. There are, however, many aspects that set OPALS apart from the average space borne instrument, and they too came with their own drivers and constraints Overall, the drivers and constraints can be classified as internal and external, with each category further divided into process- or technically-flavored This section is dedicated to examples, spanning each of those categories, of drivers and constraints that have in one way or another influenced the implementation of the project Internal, Process-Derived Drivers and Constraints The aspects falling under this section refer to those whose common denominator is the internally-mandated JPL process. The most influential and prevailing of these processes are documented in the JPL Design Principles and JPL Flight Project Practices. These documents provide guidelines on everything from cost, schedule reserves and technical margins to the pedigree of the parts and components used by the flight article and the level of documentation required Class D 227The biggest impact on the project, second only to the stringent cost cap, was the decision to implement it as a Class D payload risk classification per NASA NPR 8705.4 This decision was less of a constraint than it was a driver and it ultimately gave the project more flexibility in making decisions. The ramifications of this decision are many including the risk posture of the project in parts selection sparing philosophy, hardware handling requirements qualification program, fault protection, and extent of formal verification of requirements Early on in its lifecycle, the project sought to define the Class D implementation approach within the guidelines set by NASA procedural requirements. Specifically the project was allowed to 200  Build one proto-flight model with limited engineering models \(EMs\he only subsystem to have a full EM is the avionics. Other EMs include the acquisition camera one motor driver, and the in-house developed power board 200  Limit parts sparing to long-lead items only. The project only purchased one spare actuator and a few of the avionics cards. There are no spares for the laser, power board, camera, or any structural components 200  Use COTS hardware wherever possible. This aspect is discussed in further detail in a subsequent section 200  Forgo radiation or parts support. The extensive usage of COTS components implies, to a large extent, the absence of radiation susceptibility data, along with other environmental information. Thus, as early as the Mission Concept Review, the project and its stakeholders have accepted the potential missionending risk of unrecoverable single event upsets 200  Limit hardware and software Quality Assurance prior to system level integration and test. Typically, HQA/SQA involvement begins early in subsystem development well in advance of system I&T 200  Limit flight tech support to final torqueing and high risk procedures. The philosophy here is similar to the HQA/SQA involvement Requirements and V&V\227 Likely the most unglamorous aspect of producing a space-wo rthy payload is developing the set of requirements that govern its function and behavior. While Class-D status does not give the project a pass on developing requirements, it can shape the way the process is conducted and the extent to which requirements are developed For example, higher-class projects typically develop requirements down to level five or six, and bin them in dozens, if not hundreds of sets or modules. By contrast OPALS currently only has 782 requirements spread over 33 modules, with none of them containing more than 105 items. Of the 694 ISS requirements only 376 are applicable to OPALS, accounting for 48% of the total OPALS set Similarly, of the 117 launch vehicle requirements, only 58 are levied on OPALS. This means that the project has only 


  348 project-specific requirements that it in t verify.

  15 manufacturer specification for vibration tolerance.  To deal with this issue, the rigid tray assembly that houses the avionics and fans is mounted on a system of wire-rope isolators designed to dampen random vibrations within the specific frequency spectra produced by the launch vehicle These isolators protect delicate solder joints and other nonrugged components from being torn apart by launch loads Further, in much the same way as the loss of circulation during power outages provides a natural means of insulation against heat loss, the wire rope isolator system\222s poor thermal conductivity also impedes conduction to the outer structure of the sealed container External, Process-Derived Drivers and Constraints While many decisions were internally motivated by the JPL processes and the OPALS paradigm, a significant number also came via the ISS and launch vehicle interfaces, both programmatically and technically As one might anticipate, the ISS interface in particular impacted the OPALS day-to-day operations as well as the design features it implemented. The most clear example of this aspect came via the over 400 requirements imposed by the ISS program on the OPALS payload, followed by the V&V process mandated to demonstrate compliance Requirements 227As one of the first payloads to negotiate both the ISS and Dragon interfaces, OPALS has been routinely involved in technical changes beginning and ending with its interface requirements.  A considerable ongoing effort within OPALS and its partners has been to solidify the understanding of the requirements levied When OPALS began in 2009, the Dragon had neither flown nor been fully designed.  This was best represented in the miniscule 16 provided requirements that were largely placeholders for what would  become the Dragon\222s interface specification.  At that point, expectations were that OPALS would be completed well before its Dragon flight. This schedule disconnect led to a considerable technical disconnect In order to proceed with OPALS development despite the lack of a full set of design requirements assumptions had to be made in three key areas: power, connectivity, and the launch environment.  The first question of power came about for an obvious reason: OPALS has thermally sensitive optics and commercial equipment, and these components need heater power to be kept warm in space.  Without requirements on Dragon power provisions, the project\222s first assumption was that the thermal control hardware designed for the on-orbit ISS environment would also prove valid during a Dragon ascent.  After exhaustive integrated thermal analysis, this assumption, and the resulting engineering implementation, has proven to be valid, and an additional 12 pages of requirements and supporting data now reflect this interface design After requirements were negotiated and an agreement was reached to provide sufficient thermal power during ascent the question remained of how this power would be routed into the OPALS payload.  To direct the efforts towards a solution of connectivity, OPALS turned to the JAXA H-II Transfer Vehicle \(HTV\d Space Shuttle designs that powered FRAM-based payloads similar to OPALS.  These additional carrier requirements allowed several connectivity options and it was thus taken to be a valid assumption that the Dragon team could design around OPALS\222 desired cabling pin assignments.  The OPALS design was thus submitted to SpaceX and, as this was the first request for a specific option, the OPALS connectivity solution has become the primary power distribution option amongst external Dragon cargo requirements The project\222s greatest challenge, however, was the need to design the FS prior to receiving any validated launch  Figure 15: Early design of the sealed container did not optimize component pl acement or airflow  Figure 16: CFD analysis led to a new component layout that allowed for more efficient heat removal 


  16 loading requirements.  To address this, OPALS began with JPL and NASA\222s extensive historical data on expected launch loads, amended with ample margin and overlaid with standard levels on workmanship. The resulting crude spectrum was then supplied to the ISS and SpaceX dynamics teams who over the course of several months helped refine test plans to a conservative but agreeable level, which again proved to be valid \(and indeed conservative\via integrated analysis and testing. At the time of this writing OPALS had successfully completed vibration testing Lastly, the project has dealt with the uncertainty that comes via requirements variability from the ISS interface. Since OPALS began, 37% of the 694 ISS interface requirements have changed. Even though only 376 of them are applicable to OPALS, the project has had to maintain cognizance in this regard over the full set.  Despite the fact that the ISS is an operational facility and many components have been flying in orbit for several years, both OPALS and the ISSP are still learning about the function and performance of these components.  As such, there have been ample updates to the electrical and robotic interface requirement segments These requirement changes are executed methodically in a thoroughly reviewed manner.  After internal ISS coordination, pending requirement updates are quickly disseminated amongst payload developers.  After external review by existing and prospective payloads, signatures are requested and requirements are enacted V&V 227Verification and Validation includes the final work done to certify both that the payload meets the word of the requirements, and that it performs the intended function 55% of OPALS\222 requirements to be verified are provided by its external interfaces, including the ISS and Dragon Though verified along with all other project requirements these interface requirements demand a different balance of focus.  As these requirements are provided by external entities they are managed outside of JPL and subject to external verification.  OPALS, therefore, has no formal validation program for these requirements beyond ongoing interface systems engineering diligence.  While this externalized approach minimizes internal efforts, it simultaneously increases verification  overhead Verification of each external interface requirement falls under the cognizance of an external Discipline Engineer DE\d the OPALS verification program is built around this external approval process, which is diagramed in Figure 17.  These external engineers represent the external hardware expertise necessary to ultimately understand validate and approve all interactions with their hardware.  It is important to note that these engineers support a multitude of projects across geographic boundaries, and their ability to provide dedicated attention to OPALS is attenuated by the breath of the projects they support Internal to OPALS, an abundance of verification data is generated for these DEs in the verification of the 452 external requirements.  The planning, technical coordination, and direction of this work is coordinated between the OPALS External Interface Engineer and the cognizant engineers within OPALS. As data and plans have been generated over years of interaction among these organizations, it is incumbent upon the EIE to ensure internal consistency and remedy problems across evolving interfaces External, Technically-Derived Drivers and Constraints The ISS-imposed requirements provide the specification for the physical interface to the station, and, via the PSRP process, also provide direction on meeting the safety considerations that come with the Class A status of the ISS This section will highlight how technical specifications from the ISS impacted aspects of the OPALS design Mass & Power Budgets 227Most payloads will find the ISS allocation for mass and 28V operational power to be quite generous at 490 lbs. \(excluding the top half of the FRAM\227 the ExPA plate\d 504 watts, respectively. The ISS also provides 750 watts on a 120V operational line and an additional 300 watts of power on a 120V heater line Expected to come in under 400 lbs., OPALS fits well within its mass allocation. In fact, at no point in its development did the OPALS mass margin\227calculated as \(AllocationCBE\llocation\227fall below 15%, and since CDR it has been hovering around 30%. The 28V ops power margin has been even more generous, hovering at or above 60% for much of the projects lifecycle, while the 120V ops and 120V heater lines have seen equally generous margins of over 60% and 70 %, respectively In space, mass and power are drivers more often than not For OPALS the opposite has been the case, to the point where the excess allocations has been used to solve problems in other areas. One such example has been the  Figure 17:  The OPALS ISS requirement verification process is built around th e ISS approval process

  19 turn lead to a design that required forced convective cooling and vibration dampening, both uncommon for modern-day space payloads. Furthermore, it allowed the project flexibility in tailoring its verification and validation program for non-ISS requirements to save cost and schedule The focus of space-borne instruments is usually on the flight articles, which in the case of OPALS is the FRAM-based payload to be externally installed on the ISS. However most, if not all, projects must also develop a ground infrastructure to support the operations of the flight asset For OPALS, despite being more akin to an instrument than a spacecraft, that was certainly the case as significant development was required for both the optical ground station to enable the transmissi on of a beacon and receipt of the optical downlink for the former, and for the MOS to support commanding and telemetry The use of the OCTL facility in California greatly reduced the amount of development required to receive and process the optical downlink, and to transmit the beacon needed by the FS to locate the ground station. The development was thus restricted to the optics needed to condition the light beam for processing by the hardware receiver and the software decoder The design of the MOS was, by and large, dictated by the interface to the ISS\222s expansive payloads operations infrastructure located at Ma rshall Space Flight Center Because the interface was already mature and well understood, the project\222s efforts were primarily focused on ensuring compatibility rather than developing its own capability. The savings afforded by leveraging the existence of the already operating infrastructure cannot be understated A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  The authors express their gratitude to the entire OPALS team for their dedication and hard work, and to the mentors that have guided the team on a path to success.
