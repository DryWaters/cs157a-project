Prof. in Dept. of I.T in Vel Tech Dr. RR & Dr. SR Technical University,  INDIA saranenadu@yahoo.co.in Rama Sree .R.J Professor & Head in the Department of Computer Science, Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh, INDIA rjramasree@yahoo.com Abstract  In the recent research area, the association rule mining is one of the popular technique in the domain of data mining. The association rule mining is first implemented in dyeing unit in my previous research papers. But already this association rule mining technique is used in the area of finance healthcare, automobile and sales and distribution, etc.  In this article, the dyeing process, generate the simple process model for the dyeing unit.  The simplified process model is not in the form of diagram, instead rules.  These rules are developing using association rule mining algorithms.  The process mining algorithms, Heuristic Miner \(HM\ve Workflow Schema \(DWS\re used to generate the association rule mining rules.  Hence, the proposed LinkRuleMiner \(LRM\association rule mining algorithm is implemented in the dyeing unit using HM or DWS algorithm.  The dyeing process is dynamic and unstructured in nature.  The dyeing process is recorded and stored in the form of event logs.  These event logs are converted in to the log file.  These log files are given as input to the LRM algorithm.  The LRM algorithm produces the simple association rules.  These rules can be easily understood by the dyeing expert called dyer to process the colouring process of the dyeing unit These generated association rules can also be grouped for the same or different shades using the clustering approach Therefore, this article simplify the dyeing process using LRM algorithm to give better knowledge to the dyer and to reduce the dyeing processing problems of the dyeing unit KeyWords- association rules; Lin kRuleMiner; dyer; event logs colouring; shade I I NTRODUCTION The association rules were found to be a promising technique to obtain information about any process underlying an event log or to make implicit knowledge to explicit  The  existing association rule mining algorithms, apriori, FpGrowth and Hmine are compared with the proposed LRM algorithm The LRM algorithm is used in the domain of dyeing unit first time by me in my previous research papers.  This paper mainly contributes to propose a new association rule mining algorithm called LRM. To implement this newly proposed association rule mining algorithm \(LRM\he Weka \(Waikato Environment for Knowledge\ tool has used. The Weka is a comprehensive suite of Java class libraries, that implement many state of the art machine learning and data mining algorithms. Weka is freely available on the World Wide Web and accompanies, a new text on data mini whi c h  documents and fully explains all the algorithms it contains Applications written, using the Weka class libraries, can be run on any computer with a Web browsing capability t h i s  allows users to apply machine learning techniques to their own data, regardless of computer platform. Tools are provided for pre processing data, feeding it into a variety of learning schemes, and analyzing the resulting classifiers and their performance An im por t a nt r eso urce for na viga ti n g  through Weka is its online documentation, which is automatically generated from the source. The primary learning methods in Weka are “classifiers”, and they induce a rule set or decision tree, that models the data. Weka also includes algorithms for learning association rules and clustering data  m pl em enta ti on s have a unif orm c o mm and li ne  interface. A common evaluation module measures, the relative performance of several learning algorithms over a given data set Tools for pre processing the data, or “filters,” are another important resource. Like the learning schemes, filters have a standardized command line interface, with a set of common command line options. The Weka software is written entirely in Java, to facilitate the availability of data mining tools regardless of computer platfor   The  sys tem  is in s u m  a suite of Java packages, each documented to provide developers, with state of the art facilities The dyeing process is the process of colouring the cotton yarn from white to colour.  The dyeing process has various treatments. Hence, it is dynamic in nature, due to shade accuracy and variation of colour mix powder quality. The association rule mining algorithm LRM has deployed in the Weka tool and tested with event logs of the dyeing process with 1008 records.  Later the same LRM algorithm was tested with 12294 records and with 264 different event logs of Jayabala dyeing unit This LRM algorithm mainly reduces the low frequent events.  Many events have frequency of one, whereas, the highest frequency of an activity in the log is in 1000s. It was seen that, the LRM algorithm easily captures high frequent behaviour, whereas, the low frequent behaviour remains dependent on the support threshold values. The LRM however, cannot distinguish noise with the low frequent behaviour. The presence of highly low frequent behaviour represents, flexibility and lack of standardization, in the Jayabala dyeing unit or it may represent rare and specialized dyeing process, cases pertaining to a unique type of shades The low frequent behaviour, in any dyeing log adds up to the heterogeneity of the data, as it represents more flexibility 


 9781467306713/11/$26 00©2011IEEE  266 IEEEICoAC2011   uniqueness and less structure. It is also a kind of behavioural pattern, that exists in the log and often goes unnoticed and undiscovered.  However, whether some behaviour is low frequent or high frequent, if there would be a mechanism to group shades with similar profile, it would present an opportunity to obtain homogeneity in the heterogeneous and unstructured dyeing processes. For this purpose, the LRM provides the functionality of clustering.  Hence, this paper focuses on to develop a mechanism to use Association Rules for clustering different shade \(or complications, treatments etc.\into one homogeneous group II A NEW A SSOCIATION RULE MINING ALGORITHM LRM The LinkRuleMiner algorithm can be divided in two phases, building data structures that involved two times scanning of data set and mining the data structures built in memory. The pseudocode of this algorithm is given in the figure 1. In this pseudocode, the frequent items are built using the data structure list Fig. 1 Pseudocode of the LinkRuleMiner algorithm The first phase of this algorithm must do the following steps, to compute the header node, queues and link to all queues, they are A. Building the data structures To implement the LinkRuleMiner for the dyeing process, it is first need to build the data structures for the dyeing processes event logs using LinkRuleMiner association rule mining algorithm. For this follow the given step below  Scan the data set once, for all transactions and items to find all frequent items and store it in an array of Hheader alphabetically by item  Scan the data set once more, to project all transactions into fitems and store it in arrays of H-struct. In this stage, the initial H-header and H-struct links are built The initial link structures in LinkRuleMiner are built completely, for all queues, not only for items in the first position. The rest of mining is then performed on these data structures B. Mining the data structures The data mining process in LinkRuleMiner algorithm must be done in reversed alphabetical order of frequent items as stated in H-header.  First, this algorithm will mine all patterns containing first item without second item, third item etc. then all patterns containing second item without first item third item, etc. and so on. Finding all patterns containing first item without second item, third item, etc. found them just as stated in H-header, i.e. it has two patterns.  Repeat this process recursively until there is no more level of queue can be built and then return to the previous H-header and continue to mine the next queue for all queues III P ROCESS M ODEL GENERATION USING LRM AND C LUSTERING APPROACH In most simple terms, clustering can be understood as making clusters of similar things. It is the process of organizing objects into groups whose members are similar in some way [8 A c l u s t e r i s th ere f o re a col lec t i o n of ob j ect s   which are “similar” between them and are “dissimilar” to the objects, belonging to other clusters. In the process of clustering, the aim is to find homogeneous chunks in data Clustering is a key area in data mining and knowledge discovery, which are activities oriented towards finding nontrivial or hidden patterns in data collected in databases  onl y, t h e a p pli c ations of cl us t e ring inc lude s  finding common surfing patterns in the set of web users partitioning different documents based on their content finding protein sequences in a database, finding groups of customers with similar purchase patte the s e  applications aim at finding homogeneous members in a database, and these groups can be further used as a target for understanding behaviour of elements like customers in a supermarket, relationship between documents, protein sequences etc, so that insights can be gained into the patterns that exist in a pool of data Clustering process instances, in an event log also aim at finding homogeneity in the log [1  In d y e i n g do ma i n   processes are dynamic; less structured and involve various disciplines. Every shade represents unique case in terms of complications, body type, responses to treatment procedures etc. In this situation, it becomes difficult to find a group of shades that are similar in one way or another. Clustering, in the context of LRM refers to finding homogeneous groups of process instances, \(shades\ which are similar in some way The LRM provides two choices for clustering: homogeneous group of process instances or cases can be found that satisfy certain association rule, and secondly, homogeneous group of process instances or cases can be found, on the basis of a particular frequent pattern in the log \(itemset\ustering in the LRM is in the form of partitioning, where the entire event log is partitioned in two clusters: one which satisfies a 


 9781467306713/11/$26 00©2011IEEE  267 IEEEICoAC2011   particular association rule or frequent itemset and the other which does not satisfy that it The next section illustrates that, how the newly proposed association rule mining algorithm, ‘LinkRuleMiner’ can be used to derive treatments of homogeneous shades, from a Jayabala dyeing unit’s dyeing process log, using clustering approach IV I MPLEMENTATION OF P ROCESS MODEL USING LRM AND C LUSTERING APPROACH To implement the association rule mining algorithm LRM with clustering approach, a ‘hundred shades’ treatment process of Jayabala dyeing unit’s dyeing process has been taken.  This dyeing process has a dynamic nature of event logs, which contains the nature of dynamic treatments with 10,200 Audit Trail Entries \(ATEs\records. Hence, the following steps can explain, the simple process generation for hundred shades’ dyeing process using LRM and clustering concept A. Generation of Association rules from LRM and Clustering approach using HM and DWS algorithm  To generate the association rule for the dyeing process by LRM algorithm and clustering approach using HM and DWS algorithm are discussed in this section.  The similar treatments of dyeing process, for the same type of shades using association rules, also explained with an example. For this illustration in the Jayabala dyeing unit’s hundred shades dyeing process log is used. It consists of 600 PIs \(Process Instances\62 different ATEs and 10,200 total numbers of ATEs. Each PI refers to a shade and the complication path followed by the treatments. The LRM applied with default parameter values generates, 10 association rules Besides this, the cluster derived from the Disjunctive Workflow Schema \(DWS\ess mining algorithm is used as input to association mining algorithms, to obtain frequent item sets. In figure 2, it is shown that the cluster R0 is selected. When this cluster is given as an input to the LRM algorithm using Weka tool, it results in a simpler process model, than the process model obtained from the complete log. This represents the usefulness of the clustering functionality. It helps in obtaining simpler \(as compared to the spaghetti-models\models, which provide better insights into the underlying process The output of the DWS process mining algorithm has, the cluster R0, as shown in the figure 2 and it is used as input to HM process mining algorithm and it produces a simple process model, when compare to the whole log of the dyeing process, as shown in the figure 3. At the same time, the process mining algorithm HM does not have any discriminant rule and it is depicted in figure 3. These process models developed for the Jayabala dyeing unit’s dyeing processes whole log and cluster R0 \(i.e. derived from DWS algorithm shown in figure 3 and 4 respectively. Hence, it is concluded that, the process model for cluster R0 is simpler than, the process model for the Jayabala dyeing whole log Though the problems like dangling activities and missing connections exist in these, process models may be eliminated by varying the parameter settings of the HM algorithm, so as to generate only, the detailed behaviour and leave the low frequent one. This process model gives us information about the control flow of the shades, frequent items from the treatment PH_Res_abnorm that eventually also suffer from the treatments Pre_Treat_Absent and C_Iden_same-1st-two-yrs  The association rule mining algorithm LRM is used to derive a simple process model for any type of log. Hence, the Jayabala dyeing unit’s dyeing process, derived process model as shown in figure 3, which has whole log of the dyeing process, used as an input to develop association rule mining process model, using LRM association rule mining algorithm The output of this algorithm is shown in figure 5. The output of the cluster log as shown in figure 4, is also converted into association rule mining process model and it is shown in figure 6. Hence the respective association rule mining Associator models are shown in the figure 5 and 6 respectively, for the Jayabala dyeing whole log association rules and cluster R0 association rules Fig. 2 DWS Algorithm Cluster R0 Fig. 3 Process Models for the whole log using HM process mining algorithm

LRM algorithm and Clustering approach with low frequent behaviour In the previous discussion has the low frequency behavior In this section the high frequent behaviour was identified for Jayabala dyeing unit’s dyeing process to conduct clustering for the same log.  But to cluster the low frequent behavior, this LRM can act as a richer algorithm than the existing apriori FpGrowth and HMine algorithms.  Hence, this experiment will represent this issue.  The hundred shades dyeing process log is used for this illustration. After applying the LRM algorithm on hundred shades of dyeing process, the resultant associator process model generate 8 rules.  Observing these 8 rules, the Temp_medium, i.e. medium temperature of the shade, treatment is captured as shown in the figure 7. The rule 5 has the Temp_medium association property, which is used to identify the need of temperature, with medium in condition This treatment, affect the PH result with abnormal in condition 


 9781467306713/11/$26 00©2011IEEE  269 IEEEICoAC2011   with 0.91 confidences. So from this information, the dyer can control the temperature to produce the best PH result, with normal in condition. Hence, this low frequent behavior occurs only when the input parameter is set with the lower bound of the support to 0.5 instead of 0.1 as kept in the illustration 1 Therefore, the low frequent behavior can be generated for any cluster of dyeing process log, easily using LRM algorithm with various parameter settings V C ONCLUSION This article discussed that, how clustering can be achieved using the LRM algorithm. Two experiments were used for this illustration. They showed that how clustering can be performed on the basis of association rules and frequent itemsets respectively. The first illustration show that the obtained clusters can be used for further mining and the mined process models can be simple and easy to understand. Clusters can also represent frequent patterns existing in the log when the support count of items is chosen as the basis of clustering The second experiment was conducted using the same log from dyeing process log of Jayabala dyeing, with lower bound minimum support 0.5. This illustration identifies the low frequent behavior and cluster the dataset to discover the low frequent pattern Clustering, can therefore, be utilized to obtain specific process models or to generate simpler models, as opposed to the spaghetti-like models. Further, the clustering functionality in LRM could also be enhanced, to obtain a hierarchy of logs based on the association rules. The cluster from an association rule can be further mined with the LRM again, and one of the generated rules can be used for further clustering. Repeating this sequence of generating association rules and clustering can give the user a tree of logs satisfying different variants of the same association rule \(that is initially used for clustering The leaf nodes then would be the logs representing the most basic associations \(may be in form of a rule: a=>b, instead of a=>b, c R EFERENCES   D a vid C h e ung Vinc e n t T   Ad a W  Fu a nd Y ongji a n F v  E f f ic i e nt  Mining of Association Rules in Distributed Databases”, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering ,Vol 8 , No 6, Dec 1996   Wit t e n I H  a nd Fra nk E   D a t a  M i ning: P r a c tica l Mac hine  Lea rning Tools and Techniques with Java Implementations”, Morgan Kaufmann San Francisco, 1999   G r a i g Silve rst e in  S e rg e y  B r in a nd Ra j e e v M ontwa ni, “B ey ond M a rke t Baskets: Generalizing Association Rules to Dependence Rules”, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, Vol. 2, No. 1, Jan 1998, Kluwer Academic Publishers   Ge di mi n a s Ado ma vi c iu a nd Ale x a nd e r  Tuz hilin E xpe rt drive n validation of Rule-Baed Models in Personalization” Data Mining and Knowledge - Discovery Vol 5, No 1 / 2 Kluwer Academic Publishers April 2001   H u a n L i u  F a r h a d H ussa i n  C h e w  L i m Ta n a nd Ma nora nja n Da sh  Discretization: An Enabling Technique", Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery”, vol. 6 No. 4, Kluwer Academic Publishers, October 2002   Jia w e i H a n  L a ks V S  La ksh m a n a n a n d  R a ym ond T.N G   C onstra intBased  Multidimensional Data Mining”, IEEE Computer, August 1999   K e Wa ng  S o on Hoc k W i l liam T a y   a nd B i ng L i u Inte re stingne ssBased Interval Merger for Numeric Association Rules”, Fourth International Conference on Knowledge Discovery& Data Mining, New York,USA 1998    K r z y s z t o f J C i os, Pe d r ye z a nd R o m a n W   S u r n i a rski  D a t a  M i ning Methods for Knowledge Discovery“, Kluwer Academic Publishers 1998 Second Printing 2000   M i ng-Sy a n  c h e n Jia we i H a n  a nd Phil ip S  Yu  D ata  M i ning: A n  Overview From a Database Perspective”, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering Vol. 8, No. 6, Dec. 1996   Ra k e sh A  grawa l  P a r al l e l M i ni ng o f As soc i a tions R u l e    I E EE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering ,Vol 8 , No 6, Dec 1996   Ra makrishna n Srika nt  a nd R a k e s h A.

the largest Qi. This sub-matrix is composed of the corresponding rows with the 1 on the columns of Qi Then, continuing division from remaining sub-matrix Similarly, in the left sub-matrix, all Qi is calculated according to the largest Qi, until all the rows and columns are covered 1420 3 If there exists across the rows on a division, the columns of these rows with 1 form a new sub-matrix If there is more than the largest Qi, the Qi selected is one of Qi from top to bottom. The method is selecting the rows that at least one of their columns includes ones in the row of the largest Qi When divided into sub-matrixes, it is important that the union set of rows and columns in all sub-matrixes shall include rows and columns in the original matrix Note: the itemset of sub-matrixes after intersection operation must be empty. Otherwise, the intersection of the rows is divided into a new sub-matrix The following is an example of division of matrix. The initial matrix is as shown in table 2. Three sub-matrixes after the division are as shown in table 3, 4 and 5. Table 5 is the new sub-matrix composed by the intersection of the rows TABLE II.

        Step 6: Using elimination method in step 3 to the submatrixes and Qi queue  by decreasing order until no new sub-matrix can be divided out Step 7: Selecting the combination of rows in the submatrixes According to the minimum support threshold and rows and columns selected in advance in step 3, the number of row which Qi is more than minimum support threshold will be selected out. Selected rows will be combined. The number of possible combinations is r nC : n is the number of rows selected; r is the minimum support threshold Because there are rows or columns selected in advance in step 3, it is necessary to take into account this factor There are four cases discussed The case 1: there is no selected rows and columns in advance Because no selected rows and columns in advance, this case can be dealt with according to normal conditions The case 2: there is rows selected in advance Because there are the rows selected in advance, the number of rows to be selected can be reduced. The number of possible combinations is r t n tC  t is the number of rows selected in advance. In this way, computation can be reduced to improve the algorithm efficiency The case 3: there is columns selected in advance Because there are the columns selected in advance these columns become the part of the maximal frequent itemset. These columns do not change the method. In the 


end, these columns are only added to maximal frequent itemset selected The case 4: there are selected rows and columns in advance The case 4 is the combination of the case 2 and the case 3 According to the case 2, we can use the way to reduce the number of rows. By the case 3, we can use the way to add the columns selected in advance to the maximal frequent itemset, together with the composition of maximal frequent itemset Step 8: Searching for maximal frequent itemset. In accordance with the selected combination of rows, all of one-itemset supports Pi are computed out. The maximal frequent itemset is composed of itemset which the oneitemset supports Pi equals to minimum support threshold The number of the items in the itemset is the maximal frequent itemset length I4 I5 I6 1 1 1 3 1 1  2 1 1 2 2 2 I3 I6 1  1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 1421 4 B.an example To explain the use of the above algorithm, the following will illustrate an example Transaction database D is as shown in table 6.

Here are items for the I4 column and transaction for T800 row to be eliminated. The I4 column is eliminated by the first condition. The T800 row is eliminated by the forth condition.
