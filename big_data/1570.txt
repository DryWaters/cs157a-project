Cumulative distribution of all particles and cracked particles in aluminum 7075 It is that distribution of cracked particles\227initial cracks that will give rise to the distribution of the initial cracks \(EPS that will be responsible for te rminating structural fatigue life. How can the EPS be determined? Given that there will be a large number of areas \(i.e., rivet holes\gh stress, it seems that the answer can be found by considering extreme value analysis, as was described in where t h e distribution of cracks that are responsible for fatigue initiation was computed from the distribution of defects as follows  1 D n Fn D eF 
212\212  11 Where F D n is the cumulative distribution of the size of the largest cracked particle in the high stress area F D  is the cumulative distribution of the si zes of microcracks \(cracked particles\hat give rise to fatigue cracks, and n is the number of such microcracks If crack coalescence needs to be considered, then the distribution of initial microcracks has be to computed based on the probability of microcrack coalescence and then used to determine the distribution of initial fatigue cracks We conclude by emphasizing th at as complicated as this approach may seem, it is certa inly a worthwhile endeavor since resolving the issue of the appropriate EPS distribution and obtaining a more accurate description of its tail behavior will result in considerable improvement of the accuracy of PoF predictions and will enable a successful application of prognosis to airframe structures V  C ONCLUSIONS  225  The PoF of an aircraft structure is significantly affected by the EPS distribution parameters because to a large extent the PoF is controlled by the tail of the EPS distribution. If the EPS 
 


  8 distribution parameters are estimated from fractography of about 200 specimens, the errors in determining the parent EPS distribution parameters particularly its standard deviation\, lead to a significant uncertainty in predicting its allowable life \(defined as flight time to reach PoF = 10 2267  Understanding the behavior of the EPS distribution tail is therefore necessary to accurately estimate PoF 225  While a criterion that the probability of a growing crack not exceeding a certain specified value \(i.e P\(a > 0.75 mm 0.001\d be used as a measure for tracking aircraft fatigue damage, it is also affected by the EPS distribution parameters and is therefore not immune from low prediction accuracy. The additional draw back of this criterion is that, by itself, it does not allow aircraft allowable flight hours to be determined 225  Using fatigue-damage sensors leads to increased accuracy of PoF predictions The more accurate the sensors are \(i.e., the smaller the cracks that can be reliably detected\ore accurately PoF is estimated. For the data cons idered in our analysis the effect of sensor accuracy on PoF is particularly significant when the crack detection threshold is below 3 mm 225  Combining metallographic examination data with analytical tools could impr ove estimates of the EPS distribution and be used to determine which distribution type is appropriate for describing the EPS. While this approach requires considerable advances in analytical tools and computing resources, if successful, it will lead to significant improvement in the accuracy of the PoF predictions ACKNOWLEDGEMENT  We gratefully acknowledge the support of the DARPA Defense Science Office REFERENCES    Y.

The fact that the genotypes have been generated by recombination makes it very hard to close the set of bases by intersection. As mentioned before, haplotype inference studies usually select data from blocks where recombination probability is almost 0, so the instances in our experiments with recombination level 4, 16 and 40 are not even realistic but were tested because they are a kind of standard in the literature The results of the non-uniform instances are shown in table IV. Non-uniform instances are a little harder than uniform instances. Taking into consideration the number haplotypes generated by each preprocessing method we can see that the difference gets bigger as the problem size grows being zero or almost 0 for the smallest instances. It is also worth noticing that the time spent by the tabu search when data is preprocessed with the set-based preprocessing is lower than that of the RTIP preprocessing for 78 of the 90 instances The hapmap instances are considered hard; the execution 


information of all of them is shown in table V. The number of sites of the hapmap instances is denoted by the last two characters of the name of the instance and the number of genotypes varies between 5 and 68. Only one of the 24 instances is aborted because it exceeds the given time limit Experiments show that is the same instance that SHIP and RPoly abort. Although the execution time is not reduced for every instance, the total time for the 21 solved instances with RTIP-based preprocessing is 558 seconds and the total preprocessing time using set-based procedure \(note that 23 or 24 instances are solved reducing the search space, the time needed for the tabu search is reduced for all except three instances \(note that this process is non-deterministic Our proposed preprocessing method makes a difference between aborting an instance and computing it in a  TABLE V HAPMAP INSTANCES RTIP based preprocessing Set based preprocessing haplotypes # haploty pes  haplo types Prepr.

For small instances RTIP-based method is usually quicker and the number of haplotypes generated is almost the same as the number of haplotypes generated by the RTIP-based procedure. This is a deterministic process so execution times are quite similar Although the tabu search process was firstly implemented to test the preprocessing procedures it has proved to be an effective algorithm for the HIPP problem. The refinement process in the intensification phase is probably the strongest procedure in the tabu search; this is the procedure that, in most cases, returns the optimal solution Table V shows the result of the total number of instances solved by our algorithm another five solvers, which can be found in the reference section. Our algorithm, which was implemented in Java, was tested with a time limit of 10,000 seconds on a MacBook 2.1 with an Intel Core 2 Duo processor up to 2.16GHz and 3GB RAM, although, JVM  s maximum heap size \(on Mac OS X five solvers were tested by Lin  e and Marques-Silva  [10 with a time limit of 10,000 seconds, using a 1.9GHz Athlon XP. However, using different machines to test the solver does not mean that the number of solved instances can be increased, since, when solved, the executions of our algorithm never took longer than 4 minutes  VI. CONCLUSIONS We have presented a new preprocessing algorithm for the HIPP problem coupled with a tabu search. This new preprocessing is based on manipulating subsets of haplotypes instead of haplotype units. The experimental results show that in the hardest instances this new preprocessing step can dramatically decrease the time spent by the whole algorithm \(preprocessing + tabu search fact is due to the reduction in the search space provoked by the new preprocessing. On the other hand, the new preprocessing does not work properly in instances with recombination. However, we can think about the two proposed preprocessing algorithm as complementary procedures, because the weaknesses of the set-based procedure \(recombination and small instances solved by the RTIP-based procedure As mentioned before, our aim was to develop a new preprocessing method to deal with large problem instances but, since the implemented tabu search has proved to be an effective algorithm, new functionalities should be developed  VII.

South Korean versus American market  In terms of the effect of WOM, we find no discernable difference in the motion picture markets of South Korea and the United States. Volume of WOM is positively correlated to the following week?s revenue in both markets, and valence of WOM is not significant The effect of critical reviews, however, did not concur While the literature on the American market data reports that positive critical reviews are positively related to box office revenue[21, 34], the results on the Korean market was different. There could be several reasons for this. First, South Korea and the United States have different sources for critical reviews, and the sources may have different impacts on moviegoers Second, the characteristics of critics might be different i.e., Korean critics may prefer movies that are considered less commercial or artistic than American critics  5. Conclusion  WOM and critical reviews both are important attributes that influence box office revenue in the motion picture industry. In this study, six hypotheses related to this issue were set up and tested. Data was collected on the motion picture industry of South Korea by using several websites that provide content and statistical data about movies. Finally, data on 118 movies was collected and the movies were categorized into two groups based on the distributors of the movies If the distributor of a movie was one of the major distributors in South Korea, that movie was categorized into mainstream movies, and if not then the movie was categorized into non-mainstream movies. As expected mainstream movies had much higher box office revenue and volume of WOM than non-mainstream Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews 


movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews however, there was no big difference between mainstream and non-mainstream movies. WOM and critical reviews were usually positive H1 and H2 tested the relationship between WOM and weekly box office revenue, and the results supported the hypotheses. The volume of WOM was positively related to weekly box office revenue, while the valence of WOM had no significant effect. H3 H4a, and H4b tested the impact of critical reviews, and the results also supported the hypotheses except H4b The volume and valence of critical reviews had no consistent significances to weekly box office revenue H3 H4b. Table 7 showed that the number of critical reviews was statistically significant to aggregate box office revenue \(H4a for the attitude of critical reviews \(H4b the result more detail, an additional test was performed using only those factors related to critical reviews as independent variables. The result of the additional test supported H4, but the signs were reversed, i.e. positive critical reviews had minus signs, and negative critical reviews had plus signs. This reversed signs imply that the preference of critical reviewers is very similar to that of normal moviegoers. H5s and H6s tested the different effects of WOM and critical reviews on mainstream and non-mainstream movies. The result failed to determine that WOM give different impact on mainstream and non-mainstream movies, so H5a and H5b were rejected. H6, however, was supported, i.e the effects of critical reviews were different for mainstream and non-mainstream movies. There were no significant relationships between critical reviews and aggregate box office revenue in mainstream movies. For non-mainstream movies, however, the volume of critical reviews and the percentage of negative critical reviews were significant. Nonmainstream movies have fewer sources from which consumers can get information, and this might explain the results The above findings lead to several managerial implications. First, producers and distributors of movies could forecast weekly box office revenue by looking at previous weeks? volume of WOM. It does not matter what attitude people have when they spread WOM, the important factor is its volume. Therefore producers and distributors need to develop an appropriate strategy to manage WOM for their movies For example, the terms related to WOM marketing such as buzz and viral marketing are easily found Second, for the distributors who usually distribute less commercial and more artistic movies, and consequently have a smaller market compared to the major distributors, critical reviews can impact their movies box office revenues in a significant way. There are usually fewer sources for information for nonmainstream movies than mainstream movies, and so small efforts could leverage the outcomes. Finally, for those who are dealing with mainstream movies, the finding that the valence of WOM and critical reviews do not have significant relationship with box office revenue can have certain implications. Particularly, the attitude of critical reviews showed reversed effects Therefore, they may need to concentrate on other features rather than attitude of moviegoers or critical reviews, such as encouraging moviegoers to spread WOM This study contributes to the understanding of the motion picture industry, especially the relationship between box office revenue and WOM including critical reviews. There are existing studies that already 


critical reviews. There are existing studies that already dealt with similar issues, but this study has some differentiated features compare to prior studies. First the data used in this study was collected from South Korea, while most of the relevant studies usually focus on the North American market. This helps to provide the opportunity to understand the international market especially the Asian market, even though South Korea is a small part of it in terms of the motion picture industry. Second, movies were categorized to two groups, i.e. mainstream and non-mainstream and this study attempted to determine how WOM impacts these categories differently by testing several hypotheses In this study, there are also several limitations that could be dealt with in future research. First, using box office revenue as a dependent variable is more meaningful for distributers rather than producers. Due to there is close correlation between box office revenue and number of screens, one of producers? main concerns is how many screens their movies can be played on. Moreover, DVD sales are also important measurement for success of movies these days, and so it also could be a dependent variable. Therefore, it could be possible to give more fruitful managerial implications to various players in the motion picture industry by taking some other dependent variables Second, in this study, movies were categorized simply as mainstream and non-mainstream movies, but there could be further studies with diverse techniques of movie categorizations. For example, it would be possible to study the varying influence of WOM or critical reviews on different genres or movie budgets Third, an interesting finding of this study is that positive critical reviews could have negative relationship with box office revenue while negative critical reviews could have positive relationship. This study tried to provide a reasonable discussion on the issue, but more studies could be elaborate on it  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 References  1] Dellarocas, C., The Digitization of Word of Mouth Promise and Challenges of Online Feedback Mechanisms Management Science, 2003. 49\(10 2] Bone, P.F., Word-of-mouth effects on short-term and long-term product judgments.
