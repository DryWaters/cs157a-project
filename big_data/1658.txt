To maximize the bene?t of this feedback, companies want\nto know how different consumer-segments they are interested in,\nsuch as parents, frequent travelers, and comic book fans react\nto their products and campaigns. In this paper, we describe how\nconstructing consumer pro?les is valuable to obtain such insights.\nWe present the challenges in analyzing noisy social media data\nand the techniques we employ for building the pro?les. We also\npresent detailed experimental results from the analysis of over\nseven billion messages to construct pro?les of over 100 million\nconsumers. We demonstrate how consumer pro?les can help\nin understanding consumer feedback by different key segments\nusing a TV show analysis scenario.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nAs more and more people participate in social media\nconversations, they are making known various attributes about\nthemselves such as their demographics, interests, occupa-\ntions, parental status, life-events, and sentiment about various\nproducts and services. Increasingly companies are relying on\nsocial media to get consumer insights such as brand-related\nfeedback and purchase intentions. Capturing various attributes\nof consumers to build comprehensive consumer pro?les is\nextremely valuable to understand such insights and trends, or\nto perform a multifaceted analysis of consumer opinion across\nvarious micro-segments. For example, a bank may want to\nknow the buzz among college students about its products, or\na car-maker may want to know what science-?ction fans think\nof its advertisement featuring a famous actor.\nIn this paper, we describe how consumer pro?les are\nconstructed from social media data, speci?cally from Twitter 1.\nSocial media content has been mined in the past to identify\nbuzz around speci?c events such as in [1], [2], [3], [4]. Unlike\nthese prior works, our goal is to get a holisitic view of the\nunderlying consumer by building and maintaining their social\npro?les over time, along with a rich set of attributes. These\npro?les can then be applied to use cases such as brand-\nmanagement and digital marketing effectiveness.\nIn Section II we describe how pro?les are constructed from\na randomly sampled Twitter feed. To evaluate feasibility of\nsuch an approach, we analyze how the number of pro?les\ngrows over time when using such feeds, and also study the\neffects of sampling messages versus sampling users.\n1www.twitter.com\nIn Section III we present the advanced text analysis and\nentity integration techniques used to process the large volume\nof noisy social media data. We describe how IBM BigInsights\nplatform 2 and its text analytics and entity integration capabil-\nities are used to perform complex analysis over huge volumes\nof data.\nIn Section IV, we present experimental results from the\nanalysis of over 7 Billion Twitter messages over a 5-month\ntime period \(> 16TB of raw data million\nconsumer pro?les. We analyze various aspects of the pro?les\nsuch as attribute completeness and quality, and demonstrate\nthe value of analyzing message content to populate attributes.\nWe also describe techniques to leverage constrained keyword-\nquery-based APIs to access Twitter data for further enriching\npro?les. We use a TV show analysis scenario to demonstrate\nthe value of consumer pro?les in understanding feedback by\ndifferent consumer segments.\nSection V discusses the related work and Section VI\nconcludes the paper.\nII. USING SAMPLES TO BUILD PROFILES\nTwitter data is available through a variety of feeds ranging\nfrom random sampling of messages \(Gardenhose is a 1%\nsample, while Decahose is a 10% sample query-based\n?ltering of the entire twitter dataset. Since the messages are\nsampled uniformly at random for Gardenhose and Decahose, a\nnatural question that arises is “How does the number of users\nobserved vary over time” for these feeds? A related question\nis “How do the users observed in these feeds compare with\nthe average twitter user, in terms of social activity”?\nPro?le Growth: First, we empirically measure the number\nof pro?les found over time for Gardenhose and Decahose.\nFigure 1 shows the pro?le growth over the months September,\nOctober, and November 2012, using Decahose data and a\nsimulated Gardenhose \(simulated by sampling one-tenth of the\nmessages in Decahose many messages, and then\nsettles into a steady rate; it does not level off even after three\nmonths indicating that new pro?les would continue to be found\nover time.\nTwitter recently reported that they have 200 million active\n2http://www.ibm.com/software/data/infosphere/biginsights/\n2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data\n978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 710\nFig. 1. Cumulative number of user pro?les\nusers3. Using Decahose, we are able to detect nearly half of\nthose users \(100 million data.\nGardenhose detects half as many pro?les \(50 millions average twitter user: To understand\nthe characteristics of the average twitter user, we collected\nthe information from 1000 twitter users from twitter.com. To\nselect this sample, we generated a random list of 


twitter user\nids and selected a random 1000 valid users. We then compared\nthe properties of these users with the pro?les generated using\nDecahose and Gardenhose. Table I summarizes the result of\nthis comparison. Some noticeable results are:\n• 43% of the users in the random sample have never posted a\nsingle twitter message and 85% have not posted a message\nin the last month. These users are effectively invisible to a\nmonth’s worth of Decahose or Gardenhose sampling.\n• 92% of the users in the random sample post 10 or fewer\nmessages per month Decahose and Gardenhose users with\n10 or fewer messages are 38% and 22%, respectively.\n• The median number of connections \(the sum of followers\nand following 443 in Gardenhose. This indicates\nthat the Decahose and Gardenhose users are writing for a\nlarger audience Interestingly, the difference in the means\nis not as large since in all sets, there are a few users who\npost a huge number of messages, driving up the mean.\nThese differences indicate that we are seeing a qualitatively\ndifferent user in the three samples. Passive users who do not\npost messages are not observed in Decahose and Gardenhose;\nsince they do not post messages, companies will not be\nobserving any product-related feedback or social signals from\nthis population. On the other hand, individuals who post\ninfrequently are more likely to be found in the decahose feed\nthan the Gardenhose feed, as indicated by the doubling of the\nnumber of pro?les in Decahose observed in Figure 1. As we\nwill see in Section III-B, multiple textual signals contribute to\npopulating pro?le attributes. Consequently, Decahose \(which\nhas 10 times the volume of Gardenhose sample Decahose Gardenhose\nNo messages 43 0 0\nNo message in last month 85 17 12\n? 10 messages/month 92 38 22\nLifetime messages per month \(mean median of connections 272 443 994\nMedian number of connections 10 331 464\nTABLE I.

FIELDS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO POPULATING VARIOUS\nPROFILE ATTRIBUTES.\nIII. POPULATING PROFILE ATTRIBUTES\nThe next challenge is to extract attributes from the semi-\nstructured data that is available from the social media sources.\nOn Twitter, in addition to the 140-character long text messages,\nusers can also populate several self-description ?elds such\nas name, gender and location. We will refer to these as the\nuser metadata. The metadata changes infrequently enough that\nwe can consider it the same for all messages from the same\nuser. Our analysis leverages both the message posts and the\nfollowing metadata ?elds to compute pro?le attributes:\n• Name: Many twitter users put something that looks like a\nreal name.\n• Location: Many users put in a well-formed location, but it\nis sometimes blank or unintelligible. Even the well-formed\nlocations are ambiguous; multiple cities have the same\nname, and some abbreviations have different meanings \(eg,\n“PR” can be Puerto Rico or Paran, Brazil text.\nTable II lists some of the attributes we compute along\nwith their source data \(Message is the actual twitter message true, and “unknown” otherwise.\nTo compute an individual attribute we ?rst extract informa-\ntion from relevant elds. We then apply a resolution process\nthat combines the possibly con?icting information into a nal\nanswer. Figure 2 depicts this process. Since spam/advertising\nmessages adversely affect the quality of the resulting value,\nwe use extractors that detect spam messages. We then ?lter\nany message marked as spam and remove users who produce\nmany of spam messages. A more detailed description of our\nspam ?ltering mechanism is outside the scope of this paper.\nA. Extraction: One document at a time\nFor text extraction, we leverage the IBM BigInsights Text\nAnalytics capability, based on SystemT [5]. SystemT is a rule-\nbased information extraction framework developed at IBM\nResearch and is built around AQL, a declarative-rule based lan-\nguage with a familiar SQL-like syntax. Rule-developers focus\n711\nFig. 2. Computing Pro?les Flow\ncreate view Description_with_role D as\nextract dictionary ’parental_role_clue’ as phrase\nfrom Description D;\ncreate view parent_from_description as\nselect D.phrase as phrase\nfrom Description_with_role D\nwhere Not\(ContainsDict\(’exclusionprefix’,\nLeftContextTok\(D.phrase,5 pattern\n<I.Iword> ’have’ <N.number> <Token>{0,4} <C.child> as phrase\nfrom childClue C, numberWord N firstPersonPronoun I;\nFig. 3. Sample AQL rules for identifying Parental Status\non what to extract, with the underlying cost-based optimizer\ndetermining the most ef?cient execution plan for the rules. We\nnext describe the extractor development methodology using an\nexample.\nExample: ?nding clues for the isParent attribute The\ndescription ?eld is a good source of personal information\nsuch as interests, occupation and parental 


status. For instance,\nTwitter users describe themselves with phrases like Engineer\nand mom of three and Husband, father, blogger. The ?rst\ntwo AQL rules in Figure 3 identify parental status from such\nphrases. The rst AQL statement uses parental role clues such\nas ”mom” and ”father” to identify candidate matches and\ncreate the Description with role view. The second statement\nthen eliminates erroneous matches such as Teen Mom and my\nmother using contextual predicates using a ?ltering predicate\nin the where clause.\nAnother source of parental clues is the content of tweets\nthemselves. Note that the method we outlined above for\ndescription does not work on message text–the results are\nalmost all false from messages like Mom left me money for\npizza Extractors must be carefuly targeted to the input text.\nIn the message text, we ?nd both well-formed sentences such\nas I have 2 beautiful children and partial references to children\nsuch as “my kids”, “our son”, “my daughter”, etc. Furthermore,\ncertain contextual clues could be ambiguous, e.g., phrases\nlike “my baby” and “my girl” can refer to children or to a\ngirlfriend. The last AQL rule in Figure 3 presents an example\nrule that looks for a ?rst person pronoun followed by the word\n“have” followed by a number \(either expressed as digits or as\na word in the example above,\n“beautiful child \(“children”,\n“son”, “daughter”, “kids”, etc messages\nAfter processing the data with our extractors, we have\nannotations on the metadata ?elds and annotations over many\ntwitter messages. We then combine these \(possibly con?icting value for each attribute. For this “entity\nFig. 4. Inferring location attribute by combining clues from messages and\nmetadata\nintegration” step of our ?ow, we use HIL [6], a high-level\nrule language for expressing the core logic of complex data\nprocessing ?ows.\nFor certain attributes, such as isParent, the contextual clues\ncome from a small number of source attributes, have a boolean\nvalue, and are of similar con?dence levels; therefore, a simple\nthresholding scheme suf?ces to combine the different clues.\nFor other attributes such as gender and location, a more com-\nplicated fusion algorithm is needed due to semantic differences\nin the types of contextual clues used. We next explain how\nlocation attribute is populated in the social consumer pro?les.\nLocation Analysis: Location is one of the key demographic\nattributes to be inferred from social media data. We associate\ntwo types of locations with each social media pro?le, Per-\nmanent Location and Current Location. The former identi?es\nwhere the individual lives and is usually unique or changes\nless frequently over time, while the latter identi?es where\nan individual is at different points in time, and has possibly\nhundreds or thousands of observation points for an individual.\nFigure 4 describes how location clues are present both\nin metadata and messages. These clues contribute to both\nPermanent and Current location identi?cation with varying\ncon?dence levels:\n• high con?dence \(permanent location user\nmetadata, user’s geo-coordinates, and the description ?eld\nin user metadata.\n• medium con?dence \(current location www.foursquare.com from which tweet was posted.\n• low con?dence \(current location the user was close to the mentioned\nlocation.\n• con?rmation of \(permanent location user\nmetadata and mentions of regional events \(eg, hurricane\nSandy, Thanksgiving location combines these clues\nwith different con?dence levels as outlined below. First, the\nhigh con?dence clues are used to determine the permanent\nlocation of an individual. Here, ambiguous references such\nas “PR are resolved by utilizing additional clues such as\ntimezones and current location clues to distinguish between\nPuerto Rico and Paran, Brazil. If the high con?dence clues do\nnot suf?ce to identify the permanent location, then the current\nlocation history is populated using the medium con?dence\n712\nAttribute pro?le population rate male female 0.042\nisBusinessOwner 1.1\n4sqUser 1.14\nhasGeoLocation 1.5\nisTraveler \(desc text 1.5\npromotions 0.005\njob loss or gain 0.1\nbirthday 0.86\nTABLE III.

This information is then used in conjunction\nwith the low con?dence clues to determine a Permanent\nLocation or identify candidate partial locations.\nIV. RESULTS\nIn this section, we analyze different aspects of the social\npro?les built over ?ve months of decahose data.\nCompleteness of pro?le attributes: Table III shows the\npercentage of pro?les that contain a value for the different\nattributes. Notice that the primary personal attributes name,\nlocation and gender attributes such as\nisParent are populated for 3.8% of the pro?les. Geo-location\nsignals such as 4sqUser are populated for about 1% of the\npro?les. Life events such as birthday and isTraveler are popu-\nlated for 0.86 


and 1.5% of the pro?les. In general, attributes\npopulated from text are affected by the 10% sampling in the\ndecahose feed; their completeness will increase as more data is\ncollected over time, and with access to the entire ?rehose or to\nkeyword-based APIs focused on retrieving messages relevant\nto that particular attribute.\nMeasuring precision Table IV shows the precision for a\nfew example attributes. The precision was estimated by hand-\nlabeling a random sample of 100 relevant documents for each\nextraction task. Notice how the precision for all the extractors\nis above 80%, with many of them above 90% precision.\nEstimating Recall Measuring the recall of extractors is hard\nsince we are looking for hundreds or thousands of messages\nper concept among > 40M tweets per day in the decahose feed.\nDeveloping techniques for estimating recall for such needle-\nin-a-haystack problems” is an open research area.\nIn some cases, we can estimate ground truth counts from\nexternal statistics. For example, based on Bureau of Trans-\nportation Statistics4, we estimate each US Adult to make\n4http://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/data and statistics\nFig. 5. Comparing the effect of description and text to populate the isParent\nand isTraveler attribute.\nabout one personal ?ight trip per year. The Pew Report on\nTwitter [7] estimates that 15% of online adults use Twitter,\nand that 80% of US adults are online. If all the twitter active\nadults tweeted once about their trip, we would expect 28.8\nmillion travel-related tweets annually and, consequently, 2.88\nmillion in Decahose.Currently we observe 573K travel-related\nmessages from US pro?les in 5 months of Decahose, which\ntranslates to an annualized number of 1.38M; consequently,\nthe recall of our analysis is estimated to be 48%.\nHow does message analysis augment pro?le attribute pop-\nulation? Next we examine whether analyzing text message\ncontent to populate pro?le attributes adds value. Figure 5\ncompares the usefulness of the twitter message vs. twitter\ndescription data for two attributes: isParent and isTraveler. The\nhorizontal lines show the percent of pro?les populated from\ndescription, and the lines with markers show the cumulative\nnumber of pro?les populated from text.\nText-based population is as effective as description-based\npopulation after only a few months. The crossover point is 45\ndays for isParent and three months for isTravelers. For both\nattributes, the number of new pro?les populated using text\nbased analysis continues steadily even after the ?fth month.\nText based analysis has the added advantage that it often\ncaptures events and actions, as opposed to self-professed inter-\nests. For instance, textual signals for travel often indicate actual\ntravel activity \(e.g., checkin at airport or remote restaurant Twitter metadata captures what the user thinks\nabout their frequency of travel.\nEnhancing attribute population with queries\nIdeally running all the extractors over all Twitter messages\nwould provide us with the richest set of pro?les. However,\naccessing the entire Twitter ?rehose is either prohibitively\nexpensive or impossible Twitter feeds are instead available for\npurchase in two forms – i all messages matching a speci?ed set of keywords,\ncharged by the number of messages returned. Thus far we\ndescribed pro?le construction based on the sampled feed,\nwhich is very cost effective given the ?at fee for a very large\n713\nvolume of data \(> 40 million messages per day in the 10%\nsample how to leverage the latter\nkeyword-based feed to effectively cover relevant messages that\nmight be lost in the sampling process, thereby enriching the\npro?les further. Note that the keywords-based queries are too\nsimple to replace extractor rules. They can, however, provide\na useful pre-?lter to get a pool of twitter messages that are\nlikely to contain relevant patterns for the extractor.\nSince keyword-based query interfaces charge by the num-\nber of messages returned, a limited message budget has to\nbe managed optimally across a set of keywords covering all\nextractors.\nIn some cases, even some reasonable query terms can\nbecome too expensive Consider the travel extractor, which\nwill ?re on a twitter message such as I’m leaving for a trip to\nKalamazoo!. The words “leaving” and “trip” are very common\nand so using them as keywords results in a large number of\ntwitter messages, most of which are not travel-related. The\nword “Kalamazoo” may also get mostly non-travel references.\nThe term “my ?ight” ?nds a much higher percentage of travel\nreferences.\nThus, we need to carefully select the queries to use. This\nis an instance of the set cover problem. The elements are the\nmessages we want covered by some query, and the sets are the\nset of messages covered by a particular query. This problem\nis NP-hard and no constant approximation exists. The simple\ngreedy heuristic \(described below This is what is done by Li et\nal [8], but they do not describe it as a set cover problem and\nthey use a different stopping condition of extractor messages to cover with\nqueries. Initialize Q to be the manually generated set of queries\nthat cover all the extractor messages. For each query i, let ci be\nthe cost of the query–the total number of messages the query\nreturns over a ?xed time period.\nThen, while M = ?:\n• Let vi be the number of messages in M that match query\ni for i in Q.\n• Find q = arg maxi vi/ci, and output query q as the best\nquery given all the previous choices.\n• Remove from M all messages m that match query q and\nremove q from Q.\nWe show the result of these calculations for the travel\nextractor in Figure 6. The nth point plots the total messages\nagainst the 


number of extractor messages using the ?rst n\nkeyword queries found as described above. \(Finding the actual\nn best keyword queries is NP-hard queries;\nusing a plot like this, the administrator can determine when the\nreturns are too small to spend more of the budget.\nIf the twitter messages can be assigned dollar value to the\nbusiness, the algorithm should continue as long as the cost\nper good message is greater than the value. If there is a ?xed\nbudget, the process can continue until that budget is reached.\nIn a realistic scenario, there may be many such extractors\ncompeting for the same budget. For example, there might\nFig. 6. Budget used as a function of number of extractor messages returned.\nFig. 7. Feedback to TV shows by Consumer Segments\nbe a travel extractor, an intent-to-purchase extractor, and a\ncompany feedback extractor, each with its own query terms\nand trade-off curves. Given the trade-off curves as in Figure 6\nand the relative value of the extractors, this is a standard\nresource allocation problem. The simple greedy scheme works\nto optimize the dollar value, but there are also more advanced\nschemes that take fewer steps.\nAnalyzing Feedback by Key Consumer Segments\nWe use a TV show analysis scenario to illustrate how social\nconsumer pro?les can be used to understand the feedback pro-\nvided by various consumer segments, and to identify consumer\nsegments of interest. We chose ?ve popular TV shows that\naired in the Fall 2012 season: Glee, a musical comedy-drama\nset in a high school; Big Bang Theory, a show about geeky\nresearchers that makes frequent mentions of comic books\nand science ?ction, Doctor Who, a UK-based science ?ction\nshow, How I Met Your Mother, a sitcom set in Manhattan;\nand Modern Family, a comedy series. We also populated\nfour consumer segments identi?ed from social media that we\nthought may be of interest in this context; two segments based\non consumer interests \(comic-book fans, science ?ction fans based on brand \(Disney fans isParent September and October of\n2012 to identify mentions to these TV shows from all con-\nsumers. In order to identify whether consumers in a segment\n714\nare more likely to talk about a particular TV show compared\nto the rest of the Twitter population, we computed the Odds\nRatio for each \(segment s, TV show t segment s consumers who talk about show t\nFraction of non-segment s consumers who talk about show t\nFigure 7 shows the results of this computation for all\nthe segment and show pairs. For instance, the leftmost bar\nindicates that a parent is seven times more likely to talk about\nGlee compared to a non-parent. Some interesting observations\nfrom these results are:\n• A comic book \(or Sci 23 resp likely to talk about Doctor Who.\n• A Disney fan \(or comic book fan Modern Family.\n• A Sci? fan is 10 times more likely to talk about Glee;\nthe other segments have ratios > 5 for the same show.\nNote that the ratios for all segments are signi?cantly larger\nthan one since the segment identi?cation is restricted to the\nEnglish-speaking Twitter population, while we are comparing\nindividual segments with the worldwide Twitter population.\nThe ratios will reduce if we restrict the analysis to a speci?c\ngeography such as the US.\nV. RELATED WORK\nSocial media has been a popular topic of recent research.\nWe mention some of the most relevant work here. Becker\net al [9] proposed techniques for learning similarity metrics\nfor social media documents in a systematic manner. Using\nthis they address the challenge of how to identify events\nand documents contributed by users on Flickr and Last.fm\nrelated to those events. This work differs from our work as\nthe main focus is on clustering of events which are captured\nby media such as geo-political events. Further, the techniques\nused rely heavily on using Single-pass incremental clustering\nin comparison to our NLP based techniques.\nBecker et al [3] again focuses on identifying content from\nsocial media platforms for planned events. The objective is to\nextract event features, which are noisy or missing The work\nwhich is closest to our approach has been presented in Ritter et\nal[2]. The authors have presented a tagger based approach for\nrecognizing events using tweets annotated with event phrases.\nBesides the difference in the underlying technique there are\nnotable difference between our work and theirs. Firstly, their\nwork is focused towards identifying events which are of\ngeneral interest. Thus, for death, it identi?es demise of notable\ncelebrities. Secondly, their work tries to identify association of\nnotable events with dates to populate a calendar. In contrast,\nthe focus of our work is on events within a user’s context.\nSakaki et al[10 the authors have presented an approach for\nidentifying tweets related to earthquakes in Japan. The authors\ndemonstrate their system can identify nearly all earthquakes\nreported by the Japan Meteorological Agency. Popescu et\nal[11] the focus is on identi?cation of major geo-political\nevents and actors using NLP based techniques.\nAnother closely related ?eld of work is template-based or\npattern-based extraction of documents. Syntactic patterns such\nas Hearst patterns [12] have been used in the past for the\npurpose of relationship identi?cation [13].\nLi et al[14] use a maximum likelihood estimation tech-\nniques to determine locations of users with unknown locations\nbased on connections to other users \(some of whom do have\nlocations 


CONCLUSION\nIncreasingly, social media sites are serving as a rich source\nof information for customer feedback about products and\nservices. Companies are tapping into this feedback to obtain a\ndetailed understanding from consumer micro-segments based\non attributes such as demographics, hobbies and interests. The\nvolume of such data is huge and the analysis required is\ncomplex, necessitating Big Data platforms and analytics. We\ndescribe the challenges in analyzing noisy social media data\nand techniques we use to construct social media pro?les We\nalso present results from the analysis of ?ve months of a 10%\nrandom sample of Twitter data. As future work, we intend\nto track evolving consumer feedback by performing temporal\nanalysis of pro?les within various micro-segments.\nREFERENCES\n[1] T. Rattenbury, N. Good, and M.

One of the reasons we have found\nis typhoon arrived in Tokyo area at night on September 21.\nFigure 13 shows the track of the typhoon provided by JMA3.\nThus, many people may have not showed up the campus.\nAnother reason is that the following day \(September 23 holiday.\nBesides, the outliers are also detected on August 27 and\nSeptember 2.

For E1, we have not\nfaced with such situations or registered events during this six-\nmonths observation period. For E2, we can detect this type of\nevents by looking at the power consumption of each power\ntype in individual rooms.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nThis paper has studied an event recognition in a building\nbased on the patterns of power consumption by lighting,\nventilation, electronic equipment, etc. We have learn when and\nhow the events happened from the historical record of power\nconsumption and applied the lesson into the design of an event\nrecognition system ERS remote and parallel executions of the work?ows,\nwhose tasks/jobs are ef?ciently scheduled and processed in\npublic/private clouds to meet work?ow execution requirements\n\(e.g., deadlines with the corre-\nsponding parallel tasks \(e.g., written in MapReduce-equivalent\nprogramming not restricted to speci?c softwares whose size is approx-\nimately 20GB or more Engineering, Tokyo University\nin 2011. The ERS have detected several outliers on power\nconsumption dataset caused by some events. The ?ndings of\nthe power consumption patterns at the detected events can be\nused for the optimal power control when the same events are\nlikely to occur in the future.\nWith the cloud resource scaling feature, our framework\nschedules and executes multiple work?ows/tasks in a parallel\nprocessing manner and it is immune to the size of data\nanalytics \(e.g., the size of users, work?ows, tasks and data University of Tokyo for providing the\npower consumption data.

another 1.5 million proficient data managers. \nForbes said, “Big Data will soon become the norm and no \none tags a name on what is the norm [38]”. Morgan Stanley’s \nreport insists that “Big Data is soon to become Any Data [39]”. \nIn order to win the future, the rational choice is that “giving \ncustomers the technologies they need to store and analyze ‘any’ \ndata set – any type of data, any size of data, for any type of user, \nand in any timeframe.”\nVI. CONCLUSION\nThe development of big data extends the scope of human \nactivities. It demands proper attention from academia, industry \nand government. The world has been cooperating and \nintegrating on a global scale. Human is enforced to change \nmode from the local to the global in their everyday life and \nwork It redefines the relationship among individuals, \nbusinesses, organizations, governments, and societies through \nnetworked thinking and further to improve the human living \nenvironment, to enhance the quality of public services, to \nimprove performance, efficiency and productivity through the \nintelligentized interactive operating. The technological \nprogress and industrial upgrading of big data will create new \nmarkets, new business models and new industry rules, and \nmore importantly it demonstrates the collective will of a ncountry that looking for strategic advantage. Although there is \nstill a large gap to gain data intelligence like human wisdom \nbig data is a promising topic and it certainly helps us to \nunderstand the world from an entirely new aspect. \nREFERENCES\n[1] United Nations Global Pulse, 2012, Big Data for Development: \nChallenges Opportunities [R], May 2012 \n[2] Office of Science and Technology Policy | Executive Office of the nPresident, 2012, Fact Sheet: Big Data across the Federal Government \n[R], March 29?2012?www.WhiteHouse.gov/OSTP \n[3] Office of Science and Technology Policy | Executive Office of the nPresident, 2012, Obama Administration Unveils ?Big Data?

The derived state-machines are used\nto trace the data-flow and control-flow executions. SALSA\ncomputes the histograms of the durations of each state and uses\nthese histograms to estimate the Probability Density Functions\n\(PDFs between the PDFs across machines to detect\nanomalies. Tan et al. also compare the duration of a state\nin a particular node with its past PDF to determine if the\nduration exceeds a determined threshold and can be flagged\nas an anomaly.\nAnother related work to this paper is the approach of Xu\net al. in [26], which uses the source code to understand the\nstructure of the logs. They create features based on the constant\nand variable parts of the log messages and apply the Principal\nComponent Analysis \(PCA behaviour.\nAll the above approaches are all designed for system\nadministrators in managing their large clusters. Our approach,\non the other hand, aims to assist developers in comparing the\ndeployed system on such large clusters against the develop-\nment cloud.\nX. CONCLUSION\nDevelopers of BDA Apps typically first develop their appli-\ncation with a small sample of data in a pseudo cloud, then\ndeploy the application in a large scale cloud environment.\nHowever, the larger data and more complex environments\nlead to unexpected executions of the underlying platform.\nSuch unexpected executions and their context cannot be easily\nuncovered by traditional approaches.\nIn this paper, we propose an approach to uncover the\ndifferent behaviour of the underlying platforms for BDA Apps\nbetween runs with small testing data and large real-life data\nin a cloud environment. To evaluate our approach, we perform\na case study on Hadoop, a widely used platform, with three\nBDA Apps. The case study results show the strength of our\napproach in two aspects:\n1 drastically reduces the verification effort\nby 86-97% when verifying the deployment of BDA\nApps in the cloud.\n2 the prob-\nlematic logs reported by our approach are much fewer\nthan using keyword search, which makes it possible to\nmanually explore the problematic logs.\nIn addition, our approach provides additional context informa-\ntion \(execution sequences sequences of the logs to\nrapidly understand the cause of problematic log lines.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
