INTRODUCTION \nWith the advent of the Internet, the generation of data \nfrom networked sources has grown exponentially over the \npast 20 years. There is a huge interest in the analysis and \nmining of these big data in order to effectively exploit the \ninformation to improve efficiency and quality of service \nfor consumers and producers alike However, the \ncomputing capabilities of current multi-core \nmicroprocessors are unable to meet the data mining nrequirements to effectively mine the data on time, thus \nneeding parallel acceleration hardware such as GPUs 1] \nto accelerate the data mining. Even though High \nPerformance Computing solutions are available today for nthe above processing usage, the cost is still relatively high \nfor general deployment and usage.  \nGPUs are massively parallel multi-threaded multicore \nprocessors that allow large amounts of data to be \nprocessed in parallel to speed up computation time. The \nSingle Instruction Multiple Threads \(SIMT Nvidia GPU places it between the Single \nInstruction Multiple Data \(SIMD and the Simultaneous Multithreading \(SMT and efficiency. Current benchmarking shows \nthat GPUs can execute up to a few orders of magnitude \nfaster than CPUs for certain types of algorithms [2], and a \nlarge set of work has been done in order to leverage on \nthe GPU computing capabilities [3, 4]. \nSince GPUs are treated as a coprocessor with its own \narchitecture applications must be designed to reflect the \ntwo-processor nature of the system. As such, data needs \nto be transferred from host \(PC device gains by using GPUs, functional specific \nalgorithms and application specific algorithms exploiting \nGPU architecture need to be designed for optimum data \nprocessing. Thus, we have designed a set of library suites nnamed as “MIMOS Accelerator Libraries” \(MiAccLib nalgorithms are categorized in to different groups namely, \n‘Common MiAccLib’, ‘Finance MiAccLib Text/String \nMiAccLib’, ‘DB MiAccLib’ etc. These libraries are \ndesigned and developed using MiAccLib framework such \nthat the code can run seamlessly on different processors \n\(GPU and multicore for now architecture exploiting \nunderlying parallelization capabilities.  \nIn order to exploit current GPU computing capabilities \nfor MiAccLib, we have to take into consideration the \ncharacteristics of the GPU and how it can cooperate with \nthe CPU. One such consideration is the disparity of the \ncomputation capabilities between versions of the Nvidia \nGPU cards. As such, a chunking and load-balancing \nmechanism that splits and distributes data to different \nGPU cards in the system based on their computing \ncapability has to be developed. Secondly, the I/O delays \ndue to moving data to and from the hard disk, RAM, and \nGPU cards need to be considered when designing the \nframework in order to ensure that the overall system \n2013 27th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops\n978-0-7695-4952-1/13 26.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/WAINA.2013.238\n1411\nperformance \(multi-core CPU and GPU at least an order of magnitude compared to a multi-\ncore CPU  alone. Otherwise, there is no justification for nmulti-architecture development. \nTo meet these requirements, we designed the \nMiAccLib framework for multiple GPU support along \nwith CPU synchronization. Our initial goal was to exploit \nGPUs for text based processing and analytics work. In \norder to evaluate our framework, we implemented one \nsearch and one sort algorithm for text processing on our \nframework, and demonstrate how we can utilize these \nalgorithms for data cleansing. We then evaluate these \nalgorithms against multicore GPU versions.  \n \nSection II describes related works, while Section III \ndetails our framework and system architecture for \nMiAccLib. We outline our implementation in Section IV, \nand show the results of our algorithms on various \ndifferent GPU cards in Section V. Finally, we 


conclude in \nSection VI. \nII. RELATED WORKS \nThe MapReduce[5] framework for distributed \ncomputing has been reproduced on the GPU as mars[4]. \nHowever, mars only works by distributing the data set \nover streaming processors on a single GPU card. The \nMiAccLib framework has a more macro-level data \ndistribution orientation that works by chunking data into \nmultiple GPU cards. \nGPUMiner [1] is a parallel data mining framework for nusing GPUs for data mining work. It is composed of three \nparts – a storage and buffer management module, a nvisualization module, and a mining module. GPUMiner \nutilizes DirectX for visualization and CUDA for the data nmining module. While the focus of GPUMiner is on data \nmining, MiAccLib is a framework to utilize the GPU for a \nwide range of string processing functions including, but \nnot limited to, data mining, analytics, and in-memory \ndatabase like operations. \nPGI Accelerator [6] is a directive based high-level \nprogramming model that can parallelize loops in C code \nfor GPU programming. This model of parallelization \nsimplifies the task of the programmer in converting loops \nto a GPU specific language, but it is complementary to \nMiAccLib rather than a competitor since it works on a \ndifferent level of parallelization. \nOpenCL [7] is a platform independent standard for \nprogramming heterogeneous systems. OpenCL programs \nare compiled just in time for execution, and can be used \ntogether with MiAccLib or other run-time libraries. \nHowever, we have disabled OpenCL support as it is not \noptimized for GPUs at the moment, and real-gains on \nGPUs can only be seen through optimized code as there \nare additional overheads from data movement. \nCUDA [8] or Compute Unified Device Architecture is \nNvidia’s parallel computing architecture for their GPU \ncards. CUDA is an extension of C along with a set of \nlibraries that are mostly for non-graphics related \nprocessing. The code for MiAccLib is built on CUDA for \nthe GPU computation parts. \n \nIII. FRAMEWORK ARCHITECTURE DESIGN \nWe designed the MiAccLib framework to be modular \nin order for it to be extensible. MiAccLib is divided into 3 \nlayers – a wrapper layer, an application specific layer, and \na functional algorithm layer as shown in Fig. 1. The nMiAccLib framework is built to run on top of different \nprocessor architectures. One of the challenges of such a \nsystem is the need to support libraries written on different \nlanguages for different architectures However, we focus \non our work with GPU in this paper. \nThe library interface wrapper layer provides a \ncommon interface for users to utilize functions that have \nbeen implemented for various hardware processors and nco-processors. For example, a search function can be used \non either a GPU card or a multi-core CPU card or on both \nas the user requires. The functions exposed to the users at \nthis layer share a common format as shown in Fig. 2. \nThe function takes in a variable number of parameters \nand ends with parameters that takes in type \nmiacclibComputePlatform platform to determine \nthe specific computing architecture that it will be nexecuted on, int device bitmap to set the device on \nwhich it will execute on, migpuaccMode_m gpumode to \n \n nFigure 1.     MiAccLib framework architecture \ndiagram. \nString Finance Database Scientific\nData cleansing Data mining In-memory DB\nApplication Specific Libraries\nFunctional Algorithm Libraries\nHardware processors\nLibrary Interface Wrapper\n1412\ndetermine the whether the GPU execution is to be done on \na single device or multiple devices, and int core and \nmicpuaccMode_m cpumode to determine the number of \nCPU cores to execute on. All these parameters provide \nusers with a fine grained level of control when executing \ntasks However, they can also leave the parameters to the \ndefault value for the framework to determine the best nparameters for performance based on the available \nresources, function profiling, and data size. \nThe application specific libraries are a set of basic \nfunctions that have been linked together to perform a ncertain task. An example of such a task is a financial \ncalculation of value-at-risk \(VAR  napplication specific library \(finance MiAccLib sorting using \na preprocessing kernel \(eg. changing floating point \nnumbers to unsigned integers pre-processed \ndata using a sorting kernel, sends the sorted data to a \npercentile kernel to obtain the result, and converts the \nfinal result back into a floating point value. \nThe functional algorithm libraries are a collection of \nkernels that perform tasks in similar areas, and are the \nbasic building blocks for the library framework. For \nexample, the string processing library contains a set of \ndifferent search algorithms that are exposed through the \nlibrary wrapper interface. Each search algorithm gives a \ndifferent set of performance that users can try to use for \ndifferent application purposes. Sets of kernels from \ndifferent functional algorithm libraries can also be \nintegrated to perform a larger task by the application \nspecific libraries.  \nIn order to achieve an overall improvement of the \nwhole system rather than emphasizing just faster \nexecution of parts of the workflow, a holistic view needs \nto be taken during system architecture design. This is \nespecially true when considering latency for I/O and load \nbalancing for data distribution to GPUs of varying \ncapabilities. \nThe first step is to decide which parts of the workflow \nare more suitable to be executed on the CPU or GPU. \nTypically, functions that require a lot of calculations that \ncan be parallelized or have a lot of uncorrelated data to be \nprocessed are suitable for execution on the GPU. For 


nexample, matching data from columns of two different \ntables is very suitable for GPU processing as each entry of \na column can be compared independently from any other \nentry. This allows the system to leverage on the parallel \nnature of the GPUs. \nThe second step is to determine how to order the data \ntransfer and processing so that latency can be hidden. \nMiAccLib provides methods to split data into chunks that \nare readily transferrable to multiple GPU cards based on \ntheir available memory and computing power profiles nThis ensures the data is distributed and processed \noptimally so that delays are kept to a minimum. Data nchunking also needs to be done in a manner that allows \nthe data structure to be preserved so that each chunk can \nbe processed individually. The data in the chunks will \nnormally need to be converted into a structure of arrays \nfor faster processing. This is antithetical to the normal \ncolumn format in databases, so data will need to be \ntransposed when copied to the GPU. \n \nIV. IMPLEMENTATION \nWe have currently implemented a few different functional \nalgorithm libraries into our framework. We will discuss \nsome of the implementation details and challenges in this \nsection. \nOne of the biggest limitations to using GPU cards for \ntext processing is the large amounts of data that must be \nmoved through the PCI-e bus to and from the GPU, and nalso the reading and writing of data from the hard disk, \nwhich is five times or more slower than the PCI-e bus. \nStreaming is the method commonly used to hide or \nminimize the data transfer latency, where data is sent and \nreceived in small chunks using direct memory access \n\(DMA processing \nis performed on the chunks already received by the GPU. \nTo enhance the parallel processing of data and \nmemory transfer, profiling of kernels need to be \nperformed beforehand to determine the duration of the \nkernel execution time. Based on the kernel execution time, \nthe size of the data chunks used can be determined using \nthe PCI-e data transfer speed as well as the kernel \nexecution time. On initial observation it may seem that \nchunking data to the minimum size chunk would seem \nlike the logical choice to minimize overall delay as that \nwill give the most overlap between data transfer and data \nprocessing. However, the transfers of many small chunks \ngive rise to additional overhead time between data \ntransfers. For example the transfer of a single chunk size \nof 64MB gives the highest data transfer throughput, but \nmultiple transfers of 64MB chunks incur a 33% overhead \non that of a single chunk transfer. \nGetting outputs from kernel execution on the GPU is \nanother trade-off issue that has to be considered during \nimplementation. For example, an algorithm returning \nmultiple search results in an array needs to ensure that the \nglobal variable that serves as the index of the array is not \naccessed simultaneously by multiple threads. Since there \nis no concept of critical sections in CUDA, a mutex must \nbe implemented using the “atomicCAS” instruction to nFigure 2.     Format of function \nmiacclibError_m \nMiAccLib::FunctionName\(param_type1 \nparam1, param_type2 param2, … \nmiacclibComputePlatform_m platform, \nint device, migpuaccMode_m gpumode, \nint core, micpuaccMode_m cpumode other cores.  \nWhile this works well if there are only a few results to \nbe returned, searches with many results will cause many \nthreads to be executed serially for this section. Besides \nthis, atomic instructions in CUDA are slower than other \ninstructions since they need to access global memory \neverytime a read and write is performed, and a timeout \nmay occur if too many threads in the same warp try to \nlock the same global variable.  \nA trade-off using additional memory can be done by \nallocating an array of bytes or bits equivalent to the size \nof search data. Each thread can mark the equivalent byte \nor bit in the result array without the need for a mutex. \nHowever, this requires a much larger memory allocation \nfor the output, and a larger delay when moving the results \nback to the CPU. \n \nV. RESULTS \nTwo of the most important features for text processing is \nsorting and matching. In this section, we discuss the \nresults from our implementations of the radix sort and \nstring matching in our MiAccLib framework. \nWe implemented the radix sort algorithm into the \nMiAccLib framework and tested it with text and \nnumerical data sorting. The radix sort algorithm is nsuitable to be implemented in the GPU because it is a \nnon-comparative sorting algorithm that sorts by ndistributing the data into different buckets based on the \nvalues in the specific digit positions. With simple \npreprocessing of the data, floating point data can also be \nsorted using radix sort. The radix sort has a complexity of \nO\(k n has. \nThe radix sort algorithm for text data types \(Fig. 3 number of \nCUDA cores, and can sort millions of numbers within \nmilliseconds. In comparison, an Intel® Xeon Quad Core \nE5620 sorting the 10M text data takes about 7s when \nrunning on all 4 cores. \nWe also implemented a string matching algorithm, \nwhich matches all the characters in a keyword to a string \nfrom a large text file This search is O\(n we copy chunks of the text into the \nshared memory of the GPU, which is much faster than \naccessing global memory. Then, each thread in a warp \nsearches for the keyword at different points of the text. \nThe same 


search is repeated for other chunks of memory \nat other streaming multiprocessors throughout the GPU. \nThe results of the search are returned either in arrays the \nsize of the search text or in arrays of integers pointing to \nthe positions of the characters in the search text, as \ndetailed in the previous section. \nFrom our results in Fig. 4, we can see that the \nalgorithm scales well according to the number of CUDA \ncores and shading processor speeds of the GPUs. For \nexample, the Tesla C2075 GPU is three times as fast as \nthe Quadro 2000 due to having almost three times as \nmany CUDA cores as well as having a much higher \nmemory bandwidth between the global memory and the \nshared memory. This allows it to complete memory \nintensive jobs, such as matching and sorting, much faster \nthan the Quadro 2000. \nWhen we distribute the matching load between 2 cards, \nthe throughput for the searches is slightly lower than the \nsum of the throughput of each card individually. The \n \nFigure 3      MiAccLib framework architecture diagram. \n1414\nreason for this is mainly due to the overhead of \ndistributing data to two separate cards on the same PCI-e \nbus. For example performing a search for a 4-byte \nkeyword from 2 million characters takes an average of \n275.85ms on a C2075 and 545.84ms on a Quadro 4000, \nbut distributed matching on a Quadro 4000 and C2075 \ntakes only 198.80ms. This gives us a throughput of \n7.25MB/s and 3.66MB/s for the C2075 and Quadro 4000, \nrespectively, and a combined throughput of 10.91MB/s. \nHowever, the distributed matching on both cards gives a \nthroughput of 10.06MB/s nAn application that we put together using sort and \nsearch was a data cleansing application project. In this nproject, we compared the national registration \nidentification \(NRIC records, which we call database A, against a clean \nset with 13 million records, which we call database B nOnce the number matches, the kernel compares the names \nassociated with the identification numbers at each table to \nconfirm the match. \nFor this application, we first extracted the data from \nthe two databases. Then we developed a kernel that first \nperforms a sort on database B using the identification \nnumbers as keywords The identification numbers vary in \nlength based on whether they are old, new, or army \nidentification numbers. Then, for each record in database \nA, we search through database B for a match. We use a \nbinary search algorithm to perform the search, and the \nbrute force algorithm to perform the match. The binary nsearch algorithm takes an average of O\(logN - 1 database A \nhave been iterated through, we use the results to perform \na brute force name matching from database A to database \nB results. The total time taken using the GPU kernel for \nsorting and matching alone is below 15s compared to the \ntime of over 12 hours on an Intel® Xeon® Quad Core \nE5620 running MySQL. The total time including data \nextraction from the databases and preprocessing was \nbelow 5 minutes for the GPU processing. \n \nVI. CONCLUSION \nWe have presented a framework for text processing and \nanalytics for GPUs called MiAccLib that allows users to \nexploit the powers of the GPU by providing the ability for \nefficient work distribution across multiple GPUs with \nregards to I/O access and load-balancing. Using the \nMiAccLib framework, we implemented and tested radix \nsort and string matching algorithms on single and multiple \nGPU cards. Our results show a significant improvement \nby using two GPU cards over single GPU cards, and \nsingle GPU cards over multi-core CPUs for text data \nsorting and matching. \nWe then used the functions from MiAccLib to \nperform a simple data cleansing operation on the GPU \nthat utilizes the sorting and matching algorithm in nMiAccLib. The performance of the GPU implementation \nshows a speed up of over two orders of magnitude over nthe same operation done in MySQL on a multi-core \nmachine.  \n \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThe work done in this paper was sponsored by MOSTI, \nMalaysia. \n \nREFERENCES \n[1] W.

ConMR addresses the need to define \nmultiple independent MR sub-jobs to provide a solution to a \ncomplex problem. Besides this, ConMR reduces the amount \nof work by taking into account data sharing at the job  and \nfunction levels. To summarizes the main contributions.  \n\(1 We propose a concurrent MR framework ConMR \nwith multiple heterogeneous map and Reduce Functions. \nThe shared data of different map and Reduce Functions are \ndefined by programmers to guarantee the data sharing is nimplemented in an efficient manner. \n\(2 levels. For job-level data sharing, the \nframework manages the data by replicating data to ensure \ndata locality. For function-level data sharing, it provides \noptimization by supplying the shared data to multiple Map \nTasks from different Map Functions. It also merges the \noutput of the same Map Functions on the shared data. \n\(3 nMatching. Results have demonstrated up to 4X performance \nspeedup compared to traditional non-concurrent MR n \n \n678\n  \nFuture work will focus on the following three directions. \n\(1 Handler to process \ndifferent Map Functions, we can optimize it further by \nmerging the outputs of the intermediate key-value pairs. For \nexample, we can merge the outputs of MF11 and MF13 in \nFig. 2\(a intermediate key-value pairs can be like \n<EI00, PS, 12000, 96> et al.  \n\(2 method using a large \ncluster size on both a public cloud and a private cloud. \nCurrently we are using up to eight instances on Amazon \nEC2. The advantage of the programming model will be \nfurther amplified given a larger cluster size. \n\(3 programming model \nwith built-in support for job- and function-level optimization. \nAcknowledgments: This publication was made possible by \nNPRP grant # 09-1116-1-172 from the Qatar National \nResearch Fund \(a member of Qatar Foundation acknowledge Amazon for providing \nresearch grant for using Amazon web services. \nVII.

The derived state-machines are used\nto trace the data-flow and control-flow executions. SALSA\ncomputes the histograms of the durations of each state and uses\nthese histograms to estimate the Probability Density Functions\n\(PDFs between the PDFs across machines to detect\nanomalies. Tan et al. also compare the duration of a state\nin a particular node with its past PDF to determine if the\nduration exceeds a determined threshold and can be flagged\nas an anomaly.\nAnother related work to this paper is the approach of Xu\net al. in [26], which uses the source code to understand the\nstructure of the logs. They create features based on the constant\nand variable parts of the log messages and apply the Principal\nComponent Analysis \(PCA behaviour.\nAll the above approaches are all designed for system\nadministrators in managing their large clusters. Our approach,\non the other hand, aims to assist developers in comparing the\ndeployed system on such large clusters against the develop-\nment cloud.\nX. CONCLUSION\nDevelopers of BDA Apps typically first develop their appli-\ncation with a small sample of data in a pseudo cloud, then\ndeploy the application in a large scale cloud environment.\nHowever, the larger data and more complex environments\nlead to unexpected executions of the underlying platform.\nSuch unexpected executions and their context cannot be easily\nuncovered by traditional approaches.\nIn this paper, we propose an approach to uncover the\ndifferent behaviour of the underlying platforms for BDA Apps\nbetween runs with small testing data and large real-life data\nin a cloud environment. To evaluate our approach, we perform\na case study on Hadoop, a widely used platform, with three\nBDA Apps. The case study results show the strength of our\napproach in two aspects:\n1 drastically reduces the verification effort\nby 86-97% when verifying the deployment of BDA\nApps in the cloud.\n2 the prob-\nlematic logs reported by our approach are much fewer\nthan using keyword search, which makes it possible to\nmanually explore the problematic logs.\nIn addition, our approach provides additional context informa-\ntion \(execution sequences sequences of the logs to\nrapidly understand the cause of problematic log lines.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
