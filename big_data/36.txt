EASYMINER DATA MINING IN MEDICAL DATABASES Mohammad Saraee George Koundourakis Babis Theodoulidis 1 Introduction Medical databases have accumulated large quantities of information about patients and their medical conditions. While technological advancements in the form of computer-based patient record software and personal computer hardware are making the collection of and access to health care data more manageable, few tools exist to evaluate and analyse this clinical data after it has been captured 
and stored Evaluation of stored clinical data may lead to the discovery of trends and patterns hidden within the data that could significantly enhance our understanding of disease progression and management Techniques are needed to search large quantities of climcal data for these patterns and relationships In this study the techniques of data mining were used to search for relationships in large clinical databases Data mining also referred to 
as Knowledge Discovery in Databases is the nontrivial extraction of implicit, previously unknown and potentially useful information from data l In other words, it is the search for relationships and global patterns that exist in large databases, but are 223hidden\224 among the vast amount of data such as a relationship between patient data and medical hagnosis These relationships represent valuable knowledge about 
the database and objects in it and if the database is a faithful mirror of the real world registered by the database Data mining techniques have rarely been applied to medical domain GTE Laboratories built a large data mining system that evaluated health-care utilisation to identify intervention strategies that were likely to cut costs This system, however is focused on cost analysis and not on identifying new associations or relationships within 
clinical data[2 Data mining techniques are also used for improving birth outcomes[3 and automated detection of hereditary Syndromes[4 We are currently in the process of experimenting a data mining project at UMIST using an extensive clinical database of stroke patients fiom East Lancashire[S 6 to identify factors that contribute to this disease EasyMiner is our data mining system designed and 
developed in Timelab research laboratory at UMIST for interactive mining of interesting patterns in time-oriented medical databases This system implements a wide spectrum of data mining functions including generalisation relevance analysis, classification and discovery of association rules The eventual goal of this data mining effort is to identify factors that will improve the quality and cost effectiveness of patients care In the following sections we describe briefly the EasyMiner 
data mining approaches 2 Generalisation EasyMiner uses generalisation rules as they are defined in 7 By using these rules, values of the attributes are generalised at multiple concept levels As a result of this process, a set of attributes is generated for every generalised attribute of the original data set The generated attributes are instances of the same attribute but in different concept levels In order 
to determine which of these attributes \(concept levels is most appropriate to the required data-mining task relevance analysis is applied on them and only the one that is most relevant to the specific data-mining task is kept In EasyMiner there are several procedures for the automatic generation of generalisation rules for numeric attributes 71 1 


3 Relevance Analysis We perform relevance analysis as defined by Kemper et  Examples of obvious relevancies amongst database attributes is 221Age\222 to 221Date of birth\222 and 221Title\222 to 221Sex\222 and 221Marital Status\222. This kind of knowledge is qualitative and it is quite usehl to mine from large databases that hold information about many objects fields For example a bank could look in its data and identify the factors that it should consider in order to give a credit limit to a customer. Applying Easy Miner to our credit history database revealed that Credit Limit is relevant to Account Status Monthly Expenses, Marital Status Monthly Income and Gender 4 Classification Classification is an important area of research in data mining Classification partitions massive quantities of data into sets of common characteristics and properties[9 In classification a set of records, acting as training set is analysed in order to produce a model of the given data. Each record is assumed to belong to a predefined class as determined by one of the attributes, called cZasszfiiing attribute Table 1 shows a part from a sample training set of the medical database where each record represents a patient and Lived is the classzfiing attribute of the training set Once derived the classification model can be used to categorise future data samples as well as providing a better understanding of the database contents. Classification is particularly useful when a database contains examples that can be used as the basis for future decision making e.g for assessing credit risks, for medical diagnosis or for scientific data analysis I ___ I Male 1 9/21/1924 I 9/23/94 I Died I  I Table 1 Sample Training Set The classification technique that we have developed in Easy Miner is based on the decision tree structure By using a decision tree untagged data sample can be classified by testing the attribute values of the sample data against the decision tree A path is produced fiom the root to a leaf node which has the class identification of the sample 5 Association Rules Agrawal describes discovery of association rules in large databases in lo The initial motivation for association rules was to aid in the analysis of large transaction databases, such as those collected by supermarkets. The discovery of associations between various line items can potentially aid decision making within organisations Using the formalism provided by Agrawal association rules can be defined as follows Let I={il i2,..,im} be a set of items Let DB be a database of transactions where each transaction T consists of a set of items such that T c I Given an itemset X E I a transaction T contains X only and only if X E T  An association rule is an implication of the form X 3 Y where X E I Y c I and X n Y  0 The association rule X Y holds in DB with confidence c if the probability 7/2 


of a transaction in DB which contains X also contains Y is c The association rule X a Y has support s in DB if the probability of a transaction in DB contains both X and Y is s The task of mining association rules is to find all the association rules whose support is larger than a minimum support threshold 6,\222 and whose confidence is larger than a minimum confidence threshold o 222  We use the semantic characteristic of decision trees to develop a method for finding association rules from a database. The rules that our method discovers have the form X s Y  where X is a set of conditions upon the values of several attributes and Y a specific value of one attribute or a combination of several attributes\222 values This attribute or combination of attributes Y is called target attribute The method for mining association rules consist of 3 simple steps including Data Preparation, Generation of rules and Selection of strong rules References 1 Fayyad U Piatetsky-Shapiro, Smyth Uthurusamy R Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining AAAVMI?\222 Press, 1995 2 Hedberg The Data Gold Rush, Byte October 1995 pp 83-88 3 Goodwin L Prather J Schlitz K Iannacchione My Hammond W Grzymala J, DataMining Issues for Impproved Birth Outcomes Biomed Science Instrum 34, 1997, pp 291-296 4 Evans S Lemon S Deters C Fusaro R and Lynch H Automated Detection of hereditary Syndromes Using Data Mining, Computers and Biomedical Research 30 1997 pp. 337-348 5 Du x Cruickshank JK McNamee R Saraee M Sourbutts J, Summers A, Roberts N Walton E Holmes S Case-control study of stroke and the quality of hypertension control in north west England The British Medical Journal \(BMJ 1997; 3 14:239-3 14, January 1997 6 Du x Cruickshank JK Sourbutts J Summers A Roberts N Walton E Holmes S Saraee M Theodoulidis B Prevalence Treatment, Control and Awareness of High Blood Pressure among First-Ever Stroke Patient,s in Northwest England 16th Scientific Meeting of the Intemational Society of Hypertension\224 23-27 June 1996, Glasgow UK Also in Journal of Hypertension vol 14,1996 supp 1 pp s224 7 D W Cheung Ada W Fu J Han Knowledge Discovery in Databases A Rule-Based Attribute Oriented Approach In F\222roc of 1994 Int Symp On methodologies for intelligent systems Charlotte, N.C Oct 1994 8 Kamber My Winstone L Gong W Cheng S Han J Generalisation and Decision Tree Induction Efficient Classification 111 Data Mining In Proceedings of 1997 Intemational Workshop on Research Issues on Data Engineering RTDE\22297 Birmingham England April 1997 pp 11 1-120 9 Mehta M Agrawal R and Rissanen J SLIQ A Fast Scalable Classifier for Data Mining In Proc of the Fifth Int\222l Conference on Extending Database Technology EDBT Avignon France, March 1996 10.

3.3 Data Analysis Module  Once historical data are accumulated we can post queries. Some example queries include 001\002 Which keywords were demanded the most in the last two months 001\002 Who have used the following keywords the most in the last two months 001\002 Which web sites were visited the most in the last three months In general a data warehouse should be separated from the operational database. However, in this project we have used the same database for both purposes. We can easily separate these two when the size of the database increases Four dimensions of facts are of interest: users \(IP addresses\, keywords, URLs, and time. The measures are also user, keywords and URLs  3.3.1 Multidimensional Data Model  Considering the schema shown in Figure 5 we can create three types of 3-dimensional cubes. Note that the time-dimension is implied and it is not explicitly shown in Figure 5. Figure 6 shows the user interface for the data analysis module and its output. We can post three types of queries based on three dimensions  Q1 Which URLs were visited the most \(given a keyword\ in the last two months \(by a user A1 A list of URLs  Q2 Which keywords were demanded the most \(given a URL\ from January 2001 to May 2002 \(by a user A2 A list of keywords Q3 Who was the most frequent visitor, given a keyword, on a URL in the last three months A3 A list of users   Using the multidimensional data structure we can offer a \223recommendation\224 function and a \223similar keyword\224 function. The recommendation function is similar to the global URL hot list in that given a set of keywords, ISA recommends a list of URLs based on the number of visits It also provides a list of similar keywords for a set of keywords given. For example if a user searches for \223java design\224, ISA would provide the keywords related to the URLs corresponding to \223java design\224  3.4 Data Mining  Once ISA is operational the database size will keep increasing. It is likely that we can discover some interesting rules or correlations hidden in the large data set from the ISA database. In the ISA environment there are two kinds of knowledge to be mined: association rules and sequential patterns  3.4.1 Mining Association Rules from ISA Database  Using the association rule algorithm we can derive rules like: \223Which URLs are likely to be visited for a specific keyword?\224 and \223Which keywords are likely to be used on a specific URL?\224 The association rule approach can find some correlations from a large data set [3   Basically there are two steps involved to derive an association rule from a data set: \(1\ find frequent items and \(2\e the association rules from the frequent items We have employed the DHP \(Direct Hashing and Pruning\ algorithm [13 in the Data M i ner  T h is algo r ithm  utilizes hash techniques to accelerate the generation of frequent item sets We have also made some modifications on the original DHP algorithm to make it more efficient. The original DHP algorithm makes several scans on the transactional data. During each scan, new frequent item sets are discovered and some items in the transactional data are pruned if they will not be in any frequent item sets during the next scan. The original DHP algorithm counts the number of occurrences of an item set twice, one to count if that item set is frequent or not, and one to check whether any item in the transactional data can be deleted However, we propose that one count is eno ugh. In fact during the first count, we will already find out the items that will not appear in frequent item sets in future scans Before the starting of the k-th scan of the algorithm, we have already generated k-1 item sets. During the k-th scan we generate the candidate frequent k item sets by selectively combining two frequent k-1 item sets into one k item set using the a priori rules. Here we also employ a hash technique to discover quickly whether all the k-1 item subsets of a candidate k item set are frequent. If not we can delete this candidate k item set since it cannot be a frequent set. After then the remaining candidate k item sets will be inserted into a hash table, where they are counted to satisfy the minimum support. As shown in Figure 7, assuming a database size of 10,000 transactions the time consumed by the improved DHP algorithm decreases rapidly as we increase the minimum supporting percentage  3.4.2 Mining Sequential Patterns from the ISA Database  Whenever a client uses ISA the transaction time is recorded into the database. Using the database we can obtain some knowledge about how and when different web sites were visited. In other words, we can extract some sequential patterns based on the access information Proceedings of the IEEE Fourth International Symposium on Multimedia Software Engineering \(MSE\22202 2002114351/02 $17.00 \251 2002 IEEE

For example assuming the data in Table 1 and the minimum support s is 2, we can extract the sequential pattern 23->38->49, i.e. users often tend to visit 23, then 38, followed by 49  t  User ID URL 1 5 23 49 1 <5 38 1 5 45 49 2 <23 2 <19 38 2 23 47 49   Extracting sequential patterns typically needs much more computational power than finding association rules The sequential discovery techniques we use involve 4 phases 001\002 Phase 1 finds the frequent item sets from the data sequences. This is almost identical to finding association rules. However, each item set is only counted once for every user. Therefore, although item 5 appears 3 times for user 1, it is only counted as appearing once 001\002 Phase 2 enumerates all the frequent items sets 1: <23 2: <38 3: <49 4: <23 49 001\002 Phase 3 transforms the original data sequences by replacing the items with the enumerated item sets  Table 2.  Transformed data  User ID URL 1 1 3 4 1 2 1 3 2 1 2 2 2 1 3 4  001\002 Phase 4 finds the frequent patterns in the transformed data by the counting algorithm similar to DHP. We can obtain the frequent sequential patterns that satisfy the minimum support. In this case, the sequences <1 2> <1 3> <2 3> <1 2 3> appear twice so they are all frequent sequences  We can employ a lexical tree to count the frequent sequential patterns efficiently during phase 4. Figure 8 shows the paths of the lexical tree. Figure 9 shows the quential pattern search algorithm along with the support percentage and the execution ansaction database  4. Conclusions  We have introduced the Internet Search Advisor ISA\, a personalized, knowledge-driven search system that helps the user to find web information based on individual preferences. To our knowledge, no existing search engines provide such personalized search results We have also implemented a data miner to extract association rules and sequential patterns based on an improved DHP algorithm that reduces the cost of the trim process. Finally we have introduced a data structure, called lexical tree, to find sequential patterns efficiently In the future, we need to develop an efficient sequential pattern data-mining algorithm that avoids generating all the candidate sets. We also need an efficient similarity-matching algorithm to find the similar URLs related to a specific keyword  References  1  R  A g arw a l   C  A g arw a l an d V  P r asad  A T r ee P r o j ect i o n  Algorithm for Generation of Frequent Item Sets Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing pp. 350-371, 2001  2 S  Ag a r wa l  R  Ag r a wa l   P  M   D e s h p a n d e   A Gu p t a   J  F   Naughton, R.Ramakrishnan, and S.

Such a small mod ification to the original HPA algorithm could improve the linearity substantially 4.6 Effect of increasing transaction Figure 13 shows the effect of increasing transac tion database sue as the number of transactions is increased from 256,000 to 2 million transactions We used the data set t15.14 The behavior of the results does not change with increased database size The minimum support value was set to 0.4 The num ber of processors is kept at 16 As shown each of the parallel algorithms attains linearity 5 Summary and related work In this paper we proposed four parallel algorithms for mining association rules A summary of the four database size Sizeup 0 I 0 500 loo0 1500 uxw amount of transaction thousands Figure 13 Sizeup curve algorithms is shown in Table 5 In NPA the candi date itemsets are just copied amongst all the proces sors Each processor works on the entire candidate itemsets NPA requires no data transfer when the supports are counted However in the case where the entire candidate itemsets do not fit within the mem ory of a single processor the candidate itemsets are divided and the supports are counted by scanning the transaction database repeatedly Thus Disk 1/0 cost of NPA is high PDM, proposed in 6 is the same as NPA which copies the candidate itemsets among all the processors Disk 1/0 for PDM should be also high The remaining three algorithms SPA HPA and HPA-ELD partition the candidate itemsets over the memory space of all the processors Because it better exploits the total system's memory, disk 1/0 cost is low SPA arbitrarily partitions the candidate itemsets equally among the processors Since each processor broadcasts its local transaction data to all other pro cessors the communication cost is high HPA and HPA-ELD partition the candidate itemsets using a hash function which eliminates the need for transac tion data broadcasting and can reduce the comparison workload significantly HPA-ELD detects frequently occurring itemsets and handles them separately which can reduce the influence of the workload skew 6 Conclusions Since mining association rules requires several scans of the transaction file its computational requirements are too large for a single processor to have a reasonable response time This motivates our research In this paper we proposed four different parallel algorithms for mining association rules on a shared nothing parallel machine and examined their viabil 29 


Table 5 characteristics of algorithms ity through implementation on a 64 node parallel ma chine the Fujitsu AP1000DDV If a single processor can hold all the candidate item sets parallelization is straightforward It is just suf ficient to partition the transaction over the proces sors and for each processor to process the allocated transaction data in parallel We named this algo rithm NPA However when we try to do large scale data mining against a very large transaction file the candidate itemsets become too large to fit within the main memory of a single processor In addition to the size of a transaction file a small minimum support also increases the size of the candidate itemsets As we decrease the minimum support computation time grows rapidly but in many cases we can discover more interesting association rules SPA HPA and HPA-ELD not only partition the transaction file but partition the candidate itemsets among all the processors We implemented these al gorithms on a shard-nothing parallel machine Per formance evaluations show that the best algorithm HPA-ELD attains good linearity on speedup by fully utilizing all the available memory space which is also effective for skew handling At present we are doing the parallelization of mining generalized association rules described in 9 which includes the taxonomy is-a hierarchy Each item belongs to its own class hierarchy In such mining associations between the higher class and the lower class are also examined Thus the candidate itemset space becomes much larger and its computation time also takes even longer than the naive single level association mining Parallel pro cessing is essential for such heavy mining processing Acknowledgments This research is partially supported as a priority research program by ministry of education We would like to thank the F\221ujitsu Parallel Computing Research Center for allowing us to use their APlOOODDV sys tems References l R.Agrawal T.Imielinski and ASwami 223Min ing Association Rules between Sets of Items in Large Databases\224 In Proc of the 1993 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Manage ment of Data pp207-216 May 1993 2 R.Agrawal and RSrikant 223Fast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules\224 In Proc of the 20th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases pp.487-499 September 1994 3 J.S.Park M.-S.Chen and P.S.Yu 223An Effec tive Hash-Based Algorithm for Mining Associ ation Rules\224 In Proc of the 1995 ACM SIG MOD International Conference on the Manage ment of Data SIGMOD Record Vo1.24 pp.175 186 June 1995 4 H.Mannila H.Toivonen and A.I.Verkamo 223Ef ficient Algorithms for Discovering Association Rules\224 In KDD-94:AAAI Workshop on Knowl edge Discovery in Databases pp.181-192 July 1994 5 A.Savasere, E.Omiecinski and S.Navathe 223An Effective Algorithm for Mining Association Rules in Large Databases\224 In Proc of the 21th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases pp.432-444 September 1995 6 J.S.Park M.-S.Chen and P.S.Yu 223Efficient Parallel Data Mining for Association Rules\224 In Proc of the 4th International Conference on In formation and Knowledge Management pp.31 36 November 1995 7 T.Shintani and M.Kitsuregawa 223Considera tion on Parallelization of Database Mining\224 In Institute of Electronics Information and Com munication Engineering Japan SIG CPS Y95 88 Technical Report Vo1.95 No.47 pp.57-62 December 1995 8 T.Shimizu T.Horie and H.Ishihata 223Perfor mance Evaluation of the APlOOO Effects of message handling broadcast and barrier syn chronization on benchmark performance-\224  In S WO PP 22292 9.2 ARC 95 Information Processing Society of Japan Vo1.92 No.64 1992 9 R.Srikant and R.Agrawal 223Mining Generalized Association Rules\224 In Proc of the 21th Inter national Conference on Very Large Data Bases pp.407-419 September 1995 30
