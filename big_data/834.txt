Figure 1 Data Warehouse Architecture Data is extracted from various internal and external data sources and integrated historically in the DWH serving as a basis for analytic applications As the various data sources have heterogeneous data models and structures that differ from the DWH data model it is necessary to perform certain transformations on the extracted data in order to eliminate structural or semantic differences The ETL process represented by the layer between the source systems and the data management layer in 002gure 1 covers the necessary steps of extracting cleansing transforming and loading the data into the DWH The analysis layer which provides various analytical applications such as OLAP and data mining is placed on top of the data management layer All layers of the DWH system are connected to a metadata repository in which the metadata of every component is stored Metadata provides information that supports operating maintaining developing and administrating a DWH system Integrated and properly managed metadata improves the extraction of information and reduces the efforts for administration and development 6 Metadata comprises logical and physical data models of the individual components together with their relationships and transformation mapping The Common Warehouse Metamodel CWM de\002nded by the Object Management Group OMG provides a standardised model to capture such metadata By means of this information two of the main tasks of metadata management so-called data lineage queries and impact analyses can be accomplished Data lineage queries are used to trace back the origin of certain data elements regarding their route through the different DWH components e.g a user querying a certain metric on a report wants to know from which source system attribute\(s the metric originates Impact analyses reveal possible consequences of planned modi\002cations of data elements prior to their realisation by showing which other data elements would be impacted by the change 3 Commercial Tools and Related Work There are a number of commercial metadata management tools available on the market On the one hand most ETL software products e.g Informatica PowerCenter 1  IBM DataStage 2  Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services 3  include a metadata repository storing the metadata created and managed by the tool Nowadays most of those vendors also provide interfaces to import metadata from other tools database and OLAP/reporting systems in particular A prominent example in this area is the IBM Metadata Workbench 4  part of the Information Server product family which allows lineage and impact analyses for the transformations implemented within the IBM DataStage tool The metadata model used for maintaining the transformations within Microsoft SQL Server Data Transformation Services the predecessor of Integration Services has been described in The approach w as based on the Open Information Model OIM using Microsoft Repository for storing and maintaining the metadata Although the OIM has been abandoned after the Metadata Coalition was integrated into the CWM working group at OMG SQL Server still uses a similar approach to store the transformation metadata It can be accessed via an object-oriented API however lineage and impact analyses are hard to implement as graph analysis methods are not provided out-of-the-box The second group of commercial metadata management tools are specialised products which are not related to a particular ETL tool and thus need to import the metadata using standard CWM or specialised tool-speci\002c interfaces They are of course less tightly integrated and may therefore have limitations in the metadata they can import from a particular tool On the other hand they are usually more 003exible in specifying a customised metadata model tailored to the speci\002c requirements of a company Prominent examples in this group of tools are ASG Rochade 5 and Adaptive Metadata Manager 6  All these commercial tools meanwhile provide sophisticated mechanisms for data lineage and impact analyses However as already mentioned in the introduction the approaches used for storage and querying is proprietary or based on relational SQL databases For example ASG Rochade uses a proprietary 002le-based storage which is queried internally using the Rochade Procedural Language RPL Adaptive utilises an Oracle database which is queried using SQL The actual logic for analysing the transformation graphs are proprietary in both cases Queries across repositories from different vendors are not conceivable 1 http://www.informatica.com/products services/powercenter 2 http://www.ibm.com/software/data/integration/datastage 3 http://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver 4 http://www.ibm.com/software/data/infosphere/metadata-workbench 5 http://www.asg.com/products/product details.asp?code=ROC 6 http://www.adaptive.com/products/mm.html

The foundation for lineage tracing was layed by Cui and Widom who studied the tracing of D WH data to their source in order to support a drill-thru mechanism In contrary to our approach they do not consider nested transformations but rather focus on analysing relational views in order to identify the source tuple of a certain DWH tuple They introduce auxiliary views for this purpose which can be materialised to optimise performance We do not consider the tuple 050i.e instance\051 level and do not analyse the transformations themselves but expect an ETL tool to provide the transformation mappings in form of metadata More similar to our approach is the work by Fan and Poulovassilis who also perform a lineage analysis on data model level Similar to our approach they consider ER and relational models While we base our modelling on OWL and RDF standards they base their work on their own Hypergraph Based Data Model 050HDM\051 and the Simple Intermediate Query Language 050SIQL\051 developed in the AutoMed project 7  Hence optimisation by means of inference rules and reasoning cannot be applied easily A 002rst approach of utilising Semantic Web technologies for metadata management in data warehouse environments is presented by Jossen and Dittrich The y also represent source and target data models as well as the transformations in RDF The focus of their work is however on metadata modelling and model management The use of inference mechanisms for optimising data lineage and impact analyses is not considered Finally Kamal et al present a mixed approach of storing regular DWH metadata in a relational repository 050so-called core tables\051 coupled with an ontology-based knowledge base As the actual data models and transformations are captured in a classic way inference mechanisms cannot be applied However coupling regular DWH metadata with a domain ontology is quite interesting The trend within metadata management in data warehousing is clearly to move towards business metadata used by business users e.g coupling data models with business terms in a business glossary Such a glossary can be represented perfectly in OWL We will consider this as future work 4 Proposed Approach As data elements of the individual layers are connected via transformations these interconnections can be described as graphs As already mentioned in the introduction a major challenge of metadata management systems is to ef\002ciently analyse these graphs when performing data lineage queries or impact analyses The basic idea of the approach proposed in this paper is to apply Semantic Web technologies like RDF OWL and reasoning mechanisms to improve the ef\002ciency of such queries over regular techniques used by existing systems 050based on relational databases and SQL\051 7 http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/automed Figure 2 Metadata Model The 002rst step to realise a metadata repository based on Semantic Web technologies is to develop an appropriate metadata model and represent it as an OWL ontology Within this ontology DWH metadata is then captured as individuals With the help of transitive OWL properties and custom SWRL inference rules a reasoner can deduce an inferred ontology which can then be ef\002ciently queried using SPARQL 4.1 Metadata Model Figure 2 shows the metadata model used in the exemplary prototype described in section 5 For the reason of clarity we concentrate on logical data models using an ER approach and relational physical data stores 050with their transformations\051 Hence our model contains logical physical and transformation elements which are marked by corresponding pre\002xes A full featured metadata model 050e.g based on CWM\051 would also include OLAP and reporting elements a business glossary and others The logical model elements are entities together with their attributes and relationships  representing the ER modelling approach 050similar to the Object Model CWM submodel\051 The physical model elements represent the relational data model 050similar to the Relational CWM submodel\051 and comprises tables which have columns  Furthermore a transformation transforms a number of source columns into a number of target columns 050a similar approach is used in the Transformation CWM submodel\051 The realisation of logical elements by physical elements is expressed by the relationship realises

As mentioned above this metadata model is implemented in OWL In order to simplify the SPARQL queries used for data lineage and impact analyses and improve query performance two additional derived properties are added First there is a property isTransformedInto between one or more columns  representing the fact that data from a certain set of columns is moved into another set of columns via a transformation Moreover a relationship impacts can be found between columns and columns  columns and transformations  entities and tables and attributes and columns  It re\003ects the fact that the modi\002cation of a certain element may have an impact on the other element The relationships isTransformedInto and impacts are deduced by a reasoner They are de\002ned as transitive which again simpli\002es data lineage and impact analysis queries 4.2 Inference Rules The relationships isTransformedInto and impacts require cutomised inference rules to be applied These rules are presented below 050a\051 hasSource\050?t a\051  hasTarget\050?t b\051  isTransformedInto\050?a b\051 050b\051 realises\050?a b\051  impacts\050?a b\051 050c\051 realises\050?b a\051  impacts\050?a b\051 050d\051 hasSource\050?t a\051  impacts\050?a t\051 050e\051 hasTarget\050?t b\051  impacts\050?t b\051 The transitive property isTransformedInto states that one or more source columns are transformed into one or more target columns if they are involved in the same transformation This situation is expressed by rule 050a\051 Rule 050b\051 and 050c\051 create the impacts relationship between table and entity or column and attribute based on the fact that a logical entity or attribute is realised by a physical table or column and vice versa The assumption is that if the logical data model is modi\002ed the corresponding physical implementation also has to be modi\002ed and vice versa Rule 050d\051 states that an impacts relationship needs to be created between a source column of a certain transformation and the transformation itself 050i.e if the column is modi\002ed the transformation also needs to be modi\002ed\051 the impacts relationship between a transformation and its target is realised by rule 050e\051 Due to the fact that all impacts and isTransformedInto relationships are de\002ned as transitive all connections across the logical and physical data models as well as transformations can be deduced by an appropriate reasoner As a result all information 050i.e all RDF triples\051 needed for impact analyses or data lineage queries is available in an inferred ontology Figure 3 Sample Query 4.3 Sample Queries We use SPARQL to present two sample queries on the inferred ontology one for data lineage and one for impact analysis Figure 3 shows the chosen data elements for these examples The pre\002xes dwhp and dwhl mark the physical and the logical data elements of the target DWH system whereas the pre\002xes srcp and srcl identify the physical respectively logical data elements of the source system We choose this simple setting of one source and one target for the sake of clarity of the presentation Of course the approach 050using inferred information to traverse transitive properties in the graph\051 will show its strength even better in more complex environments with nested transformations 050i.e when also considering data marts and reporting systems\051 Note that connections deduced by transitive properties are not shown in 002gure 3 The 002rst sample query aims at 002nding out where the physical column of the target DWH system dwhp.Employee.Name originates This data lineage analysis can be achieved with the following single SPARQL query asking for all individuals that represent the subject x in a triple 050 x isTransformedInto dwhp.Employee.Name 051 SELECT x WHERE f x isTransformedInto dwhp.Employee.Name g The result set in our example obviously shows that dwhp.Employee.Name originates from the source columns srcp.Employee.First  Name and srcp.Employee.Last  Name  The second example query performs an impact analysis aiming at revealing which impact a change of the logical source attribute srcl.Employee.First  Name would have In this case the following SPARQL query which asks for all individuals that represent the object y in the triple 050 srcp.Employee.First  Name impacts y 051 can be performed SELECT y WHERE f srcl.Employee.First_Name impacts y g

  6 aircraft\222s search light.  The basic tracking system consisted of a tracking head, a tripod, two control units, and the interconnecting cables.  It was also instrumented with a video camera, a high-speed dig ital imager, a clock, an eye safe laser ranger, and a GPS antenna.  When fitted with the laser ranger, the tracking system provided azimuth elevation, and range information from a single tracking station.  The MiniLIR system provided elevation and azimuth angular data, laser ranging data, time, IR level information, and video to a rack mounted computer control system for video monitoring, data recording and archiving and data transfer to portable media for data reduction or distribution.  The MiniLIR was located on the flight deck at the bow of the ship just starboard of the safe parking line and its corresponding workstation on the ship was located in a workspace at the front of the ship below the flight deck The MiniLIR was connected to the RTPS station within the island via fiber optic cables.  The MiniLIR system is pictured in Figure 11  Electro-Optical Tracking System \(EOTS The Electro-Optical Tracking System was used to obtain Time Space Position Information \(TSPI documentary imaging data  of th ese test events.  The core of optical tracking was imaging and was used to determine more accurate aircraft liftoff and touchdown points for STO and MROL tests.  The data were used in conjunction with MiniLIR data post-event to determine STO and MROL ground roll distances.  Fixed, surveyed camera arrays provided TSPI data of a particular target and multi-camera video systems provided documentation of a test event Three forward cameras were mounted to the island of the ship above the flight deck, which covered spot 5 to the bow of the ship.  Three aft cameras were mounted to the island of the ship above the flight deck, which covered landings from spot 7 to the aft end of th e ship.  All cameras were run at 100 frames per second.  High-speed, high-resolution digital imaging systems pr ovided time-tagged high-framerate imagery of test events for engineering analysis and reporting.  Video systems provided video routing, display control, distribution, recording, and editing of live and recorded video sources Ship Motion Package \(SMP The SMP was used to record ship motion and wind condition data during rotary wing ship suitability tests.  The SMP consisted of a laptop computer with a GPS antenna for time synchronization and was connected to the ship\222s computer network.  The laptop computer was placed in a workspace within the island and displayed time histories of Wind Over Deck \(WOD\rection.  In addition a push button switch was provided to display a 30 second average of WOD speed and direction when it was depressed.  Recorded parameters consisted of GPS time ship course and speed, relative WOD azimuth and speed ship pitch and roll angles, ship pitch, roll, and yaw rates and ship surge, sway, and h eave accelerations.  The SMP is pictured in Figure 12  Dynamic Interface Audiovisual Instrumentation System DAVIS DAVIS was used to document shipboard flight test evolutions.  The system included four deck or superstructure mounted closed circuit television cameras, of which two were ship\222s cameras.  The camera signals were fed into a quad-splitter, which provided a video output of a selectable single camera or all four cameras simultaneously A portable scanner unit acquired radio transmissions from both engineers\222 hand-held radios and aircraft radios.  The audio and quad-splitter video outputs were recorded and displayed by an 8-mm video cassette recorder.

  7 SHIPBOARD METHOD OF TESTS  General Personnel involved in these shipboard tests included ship suitability engineers, Boeing aerodynamics and flying qualities engineers, aircraft maintainers, aircrew, and instrumentation and telemetry engineers which was approximately 70 people.  During underway shipboard testing, the shipboard test coordinator was located in Primary Flight Control within the island of the ship to coordinate test progression with the Air Boss, and communicated with the bridge engineer located on the bridge of the ship to coordinate WOD conditions.  During each flight test sequence, the bridge engineer determined the required ship\222s course and speed for generating target WOD conditions, and requested the commanding officer or the officer of the deck to ma neuver the ship accordingly After the desired WOD was attained, the test aircraft conducted one or more test evol utions as required.  During all V-22 shipboard flight test operations, the test coordinator and TM lead engineer were in direct radio communication with the aircraft.  Test team personnel monitored each test sequence and recorded results For each flight test event while on deck and following the launch\he pilots transmitted comments by radio which were recorded by test personnel.  Each STO and MROL was evaluated using a qualitative assessment called the Deck Interface Pilot Effort Scale \(DIPES\n Figure 14, and could have been further quantified with the Cooper-Harper Handling Qualities Rating \(HQR Shipboard flight test communications with the test aircraft were coordinated with the Air Boss or his designated representative.  Shipboard communication procedures were briefed before every flight Pre-test Simulation Pre-test piloted simulation was conducted to familiarize the test team with test conduct, to develop test predictions, to refine maneuver procedures, and to practice emergency procedures.  Test team fa miliarization i nvolved conducting test events to get members acquainted with test flow communication protocol, and knock-it-off criteria and timing.  Test predictions were used to determine expected trends and to compare to STOLCOMP.  The predictions also aided in determining whether test build-up was sufficient to ensure safe in crements in GW and WOD Although roll on landings had been conducted routinely landbased, the MROL maneuver aboard ship was new and simulation was used to refine this technique.  The test team learned that a steeper glides lope was required to ensure more accurate and predictable touchdowns.  Also, the pilots developed altitude and Distance Measuring Equipment DME\nts that aided in maintaining proper glideslope.  Through reviewing the test matrix in the simulator, it was apparent that on short final for approach airspeeds less than 30 kt, speed stability was a concern   Pilots deemed maintaining airspeed to be too difficult and resulted in limiting approach airspeeds to no less than 30 kt Emergency procedures were practiced to familiarize the team in handling an emergency appropriately.  In addition single engine failures were inve stigated to ensure sufficient wave-off capabilities.  A minimum altitude of 200 feet above ground level \(AGL hosen to invoke the engine failure.  Engine failures at lower altitudes were not investigated due to the close proximity of the flight deck and inability to avoid collision with the ship.  At maximum test GW, successful recoveries with a single engine failure were dependent upon water ballast dump Maneuver Procedures All STOs began with the airc raft positioned on spot 4, and the aircraft rolling along the longitudinal \223crow\222s foot\224 lineup line, which provided approximately 208 feet of deck run.  An illustration of the deck layout during a STO is provided in Figure 15  Figure 14 Deck Interface Pilot Effort Scale \(DIPES 


  8  As mentioned previously, the shipboard STO procedures differed from landbased STO pro cedures.  The nacelle angle for shipboard STO was 71 deg and the TCL ramp time was 4 inches in 2-3 seconds vice the landbased ramp time of 6 seconds.  STO procedures are described as follows 200  Commence STO on or abeam spot 4 200  Nose wheel power steering \227 OFF 200  Nacelles \227 71 \260 200  Interim power ON and 104% Nr 200  Set initial longitudinal stick 200  Brakes \227 Release 200  TCL \227 Smoothly apply maximum power \(target full application in 2 to 3 seconds 200  At liftoff: capture attitude \227 3 to 5 deg nose up The MROL technique involved the aircraft performing a stern approach to the ship targeting  touchdown on spot 9 rolling along the longitudinal \223crow\222s foot\224 lineup lines and fully stopping just prior to the aft end of the island.  The touchdown and braking zone is shown in Figure 16.  Prior to sea trials, stopping distances were predicted for 15 to 20 kt ground speeds based on STOLCOMP which was validated by landbased test data.  Based on these predictions, there was sufficien t deck space available to stop the aircraft from a 20 kt Touchdown Speed Relative to the Ship \(TSRTS aircraft ground speed and ship ground speed The MROL procedures develop as follows 200  Turn base at 2 nautical miles and 800 feet and begin to slow to 60 nacelle/120 kt indicated airspeed 200  Landing checks complete 200  Turn final and slow to 50-60 kt indicated air speed at 83-85 deg nacelle 200  Intercept glideslope at 1.1 nautical miles 200  Maintain a 7 deg glideslope and establish recommended airspeed 200  Confirm WOD and Ship\222s speed over ground to determine landing touchdown speed 200  At 0.2 nautical miles rotate nacelles aft 2-3 deg use longitudinal stick as required to capture touchdown speed 200  Prior to crossing the deck edge, transition from indicated airspeed to groundspeed.  Target aircraft ground speed was ship\222s ground speed plus TSRTS as determined from touchdown predictability tests 200  Target spot 9 mainmount markings for touchdown 200  Maintain 0-5 deg nose up until MLG touchdown 200  Reduce TCL to aft stop at touchdown 200  Smoothly lower nose wheel to ground 200  Apply hard braking 200  Adjust nacelle angle to full aft at maximum rate 200  Select nose wheel steering wh en the gear is firmly on the ground if desired 200  Terminate maneuver by adjusting nacelles forward to prevent aircraft from rolling aft  STO Envelope Expansion Tests The planned shipboard STO test points included day GW headwind, and crosswind expa nsion, and night envelope expansion.  Only day GW e xpansion tests were conducted and will be the only method of test discussed below  Th e first STO test p oint began within the limits of the previous STO envelope which granted operations up to 50,000 lb GW.  Subsequent test points expanded in GW/WOD azimuth/WOD speed relative to either the existing STO envelope or to previously tested conditions The build-up sequence for STO GW expansion involved increasing GW in 3,000 lb increments, starting at lighter GWs and building down in winds due to increased power required with wind speed reduction.  STO GW expansion tests encompassed four GW bands:  48,000 \261 1,000 lb 51,000 \261 1,000 lb, 54,000 \261 1,000 lb, and 57000 \261 1,000 lb The build-up method involved conducting a test point at a wind condition at a lower GW before conducting the same wind speed condition at the next higher GW band.

  9 were not greater than 3,000 lb from previously tested conditions.  Each test point was repeated once before proceeding to the next test poi nt to gain confidence that results were repeatable for STOLCOMP validation  During testing, telemetry engineers were on board the ship monitoring takeoff distance and rate of climb \(ROC\hat if trending suggested excessively long deck runs or shallow climbout for the targeted heavier GWs, testing could have been moved aft to spot 5; however, trending showed that all STOs were safe to begin at spot 4 MROL Envelope Development Tests The planned shipboard MROL test points included day touchdown predictability; day GW, headwind, and crosswind expansion; and night envelope expansion.  Only day touchdown predictability a nd GW expansion tests were conducted and will be the only method of test discussed below  MROL testing began with t ouchdown predictability at a GW band of 48,000 \261 1,000 lb with WOD within the initial envelope and was repeated as required for pilot and test team comfort. The build-up method for MROL touchdown predictability was increasing speeds relative to the ship in 5 kt increments, starting with a target of a 5 kt TSRTS up to the maximum target TSRTS of 20 kt.  Results from this test including touchdown predictab ility and braking distance were used to determine a TSRTS that was used for the remaining tests  Once touchdown predictability tests were completed MROL GW expansion test points were conducted at the same GW bands as STO tests which were 48,000 \261 1,000 lb, 51,000 \261 1,000 lb, 54,000 \261 1,000 lb, and 57000 \261 1,000 lb.  For each GW band, buildup method included decreasing landing airspeed in 5 kt increments from 10 kt to 0 kt above the all engines operating flyaway airspeed.   The all engines operating flyaway airspeed was chosen so that a 400 feet per minute \(fpm\ ROC at 85 deg nacelle was achievable The landing airspeed was limited to no less than 30 kt based on simulation results.  The diffe rence in aircraft and ship ground speed was mathematically equivalent to the difference in aircraft and ship wind speed.  Thus, ship WOD was determined by subtracting the TSRTS from the aircraft landing airspeed.  As an exam ple, if the aircraft landing airspeed was 35 kt and the TSRTS was 15 kt, the WOD would be 20 kt.  Each test point was repeated once before proceeding to the next test poi nt to gain confidence that results were repeatable  All engines operating wave-o ffs were conducted for each test day prior to the first MROL and any time a heavier GW band was tested to ensure a 400 fpm ROC could be achieved at 85 deg nacelle.  A ll engines operating wave-offs were conducted to provide know ledge of and trending for altitude loss and torque required on trim descent.  It also provided pilot proficiency in conducting all engines operating wave-offs.  The wa ve-off was conducted above 500 feet AGL and at an airspeed that was 5 kt greater than the lowest landing airspeed to be tested which ensured the wave-off could be achieved successfully.  An altitude to conduct the wave-off of 500 feet AGL was chosen to ensure a safe recovery RESULTS  STO Envelope Expansion A total of 11 STOs were conducted, completing 3 of the 43 planned STO test points including required repeats.  Due to limited test time at sea, only STO GW expansion tests were conducted.  Table 1 provide s a summary of conditions under which tests were completed Table 1.

  10 power was first applied to the point where all wheels of the aircraft were off the deck.  All ground roll distances were less than 30 feet and ranged from 6.6 feet at WOD conditions of 359 deg at 22 kt to 28.9 feet at WOD conditions of 356 deg at 3 kt.  A plot of ground roll distances versus referred GW \(GW  condition can be found in Figure 18.  The largest ground roll of 28.9 feet accounted for less than 14% of the total available STO ground roll distance.  Note that the shortest ground roll distances were WOD speeds of 20 kt at the heaviest GWs.  Liftoff speed relative to the ship as a function of referred GW is shown in Figure 19 below Liftoff speeds relative to the ship varied from 6 to 13 kt Ship headwind conditions did not seem to affect the liftoff speed relative to the ship whic h indicates that ship airwake effects are minimal.  Similar to ground roll distance data there was no noticeable trend between liftoff speed and GW WOD.  It is believed that pilot technique had a significant effect on the repeatability of liftoff data.  The largest contributors to variability could have been TCL ramp time and aircraft pitch attitude on lif toff as these inputs could not be precisely controlled.  Due to the small amount of data gathered, trends can not be realized until further testing can be accomplished     Ground roll distances increased with increasing liftoff ground speed and this trend can be seen in Figure 20 Again, it was difficult to determine the effects that ship WOD had on aircraft acceler ation based on the limited amount of data gathered to date  ROC was monitored throughout the course of the STO but the ROC at the deck edge was of particular interest.  As shown in Figure 21 below, all test points with referred GWs between 47,000 and 49,000 lb, regardless of WOD speeds had a ROC near or greater than 1,000 fpm at the deck edge Note that a linear trend exis ted between ROC at deck edge and referred GW for each WOD speed.  ROC decreased with increasing GW.  The data showed a much steeper drop off in ROC at deck edge for the less than 5 kt WOD speed For WOD speeds of less than 5 kt the data indicated that a ROC of greater than 100 fpm at deck edge may not be achievable for referred GWs greater than 52,000 lb Aircraft pitch angles at the deck edge ranged from -0.4 deg to 3.4 deg, with an aver age pitch angle closer to approximately one deg.  If the pilots were to capture pitch angles closer to 5 deg at deck edge, the ROC would substantially increase and the potential would exist to expand the envelope to referred GWs greater than 52,000 lb  0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 220 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Liftoff Speed relative to the Ship \(kt WOD Speed < 5 kt WOD Speed = 20 kt Groundroll Distance \(ft Figure 20 Liftoff Speed Relative to Ship 71 deg Nacelle, Fwd CG 0 10 20 30 40 50 46000 48000 50000 52000 54000 56000 58000 Referred Gross Weight \(lb WOD Speed < 5 kt WOD Speed = 20 kt Liftoff Speed relative to the Ship \(kt  Figure 19 STO Liftoff Speed relative to the Ship 71 deg Nacelle, Fwd CG 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 220 46000 48000 50000 52000 54000 56000 58000 Referred Gross Weight \(lb WOD Speed < 5 kt WOD Speed = 20 kt End of Deck \(208 ft Groundroll Distance  ft   Figure 18 V-22 STO Deck Groundroll Distance 71 deg Nacelle, Fwd CG 


  11   Due to the limited amount of test data collected, generating an envelope based on what was tested would have limited STO operations to 4 deg C with less than 3 kt of headwind and 27 deg C with 22 to 25 kt of headwind with a linear variation of temperature with headwind between 3 and 22 kt, as seen in Figure 22.  ST OLCOMP was therefore used to predict results beyond the ambien t conditions tested in order to provide an expanded GW STO envelope.  There were certain limitations of STOLCOMP including:  no presence of a ship airwake model, a two-dimensional flight path, and the inability to model inde pendent longitudinal rotor controls  which reduced confidence in predictions and played a role in how much of an expanded envelope could be recommended.  In an effort to provide an interim capability for fleet training a nd preparation for shipboard deployment, flight test data were reevaluated to determine if expansion was possible for 10 to 30 kt of headwind up to 30 deg C up to a GW of 52,000 lb.  These headwind and temperature limits were chosen based on the amount of landbased data present, as shown in Figure 22   Shipboard test data were not gathered at 52,000 lb for headwinds below 20 kt up to 30 deg C.  Landbased data were gathered beyond GW of 54,700 lb at low headwinds which is equivalent to a GW of 52,000 lb at sea level and 30 deg C.  In addition to headwind and outside air temperature OAT\raints in making a recommended envelope ground roll distance data were also considered.  Ground roll distance as a function of referred GW at different headwind ranges for shipboard and land-based test data are plotted in Figure 23.  Notice that ground roll distances were less than 45 feet for GW up to 55,200 lb.  Even though land-based STO data did not account for the partial ground effect in the shipboard environment, the expanded STO envelope that was granted to the fleet was limited to no lower than 10 kt headwind at GWs greater than 50,000 lb and up to 52,000 lb.  In addition, data showed that ground roll margins of over 300% on LHD class ships existed.  Based on these analyses, sufficient deck run was available to conduct V-22 STO operations aboard LHD 1 class ships with headwinds 10-30 kt for GWs up to 52,000 lb and 30 deg C.  The recommended envelope is shown in Figure 24.

  12   Handling Qualities\227 Day STO handling qualities were also evaluated to grant a day/night vision goggle WOD envelope for the expanded GW envelope Shipboard STO data were analyzed mainly to ensure ad equate control margins, but also to examine for presence of any oscillatory behavior All STOs were rated as DIPES 1 as shown in Figure 17 indicating minimum effort was required to conduct the maneuver.  There was no adverse oscillatory behavior observed during the course of STO testing.  The largest handling qualities impact accord ing to the pilots was a slight directional workload on lift-off.  Pilots also noted minimal deck rolls and good climb performance and commented, that overall, it was a benign maneuver.  Several STOs encountered slight wheelbarrowing effects during the ground roll and nose tucking immediately after lift-off Wheelbarrowing is characterized by mainmounts lifting off prior to nosewheel lift-off during the ground roll and nose tucking is characterized by th e aircraft pitching down just after lift-off.  Two of these ST Os were further analyzed for potentially exceeding the aft l ongitudinal control margin criteria to counter the nose tuck on lift-off; however, it was found later that this large longitudinal input was transient in nature, did not actually exceed the criteria, and was not a concern.  There were found to be no flying quality limitations to the STO conditions flown during this test period  Although night vision goggle STOs were not conducted during this shipboard test, giving a night vision goggle capability was desired.  Thus, previous STO test results for both day/night vision goggle were reviewed to validate the recommended night vision goggle STO envelope which was the same as the recommended day STO envelope, as shown in Figure 24.  Night vision goggle STOs were conducted up to 47,816 lb GW aboard USS WASP in November 2004 and all were rated as DIPES 1, except one which was rated  W OD condi t i ons for t h e DIPES 2 ni ght  vision goggle STO were 345 deg at 28 kt \(7 kt crosswind and pilots commented th at there was noticeable lateral/directional compensation required.  The crosswind present in this DIPES 2 night vision goggle STO may have contributed to the additional lateral/directional compensation and increased workload required by the pilots. Another STO was conduc ted at WOD conditions of 349 deg at 29 kt \(5 kt crosswind\t was rated as a DIPES 1, but pilots also commented on some lateral compensation that was required.  The recommended expanded envelope only granted up to +/- 5 kt crosswind thus the night vision goggle STO envelope which has the same limits as the recommended day STO envelope was granted to the fleet  Additionally, the effects of GW on the handling qualities were analyzed.  Three STOs, which were all at headwinds of 20 kt, were evaluated to determine the effects of increased GW on aircraft handling qualities.  The GWs of the three STOs were 47,224 lb, 51,043 lb, and 54,982 lb The WOD direction for each STO was 355 deg, 002 deg and 351 deg, respectively.  All three STOs showed low amplitude inputs in the lateral and directional axes.  Control inputs in the longitudinal axis were of moderate amplitude It appeared that there was an initial input aft to counter the wheelbarrowing tendency and then approximately a 2.5 to 3 inches forward stick input to keep the pitch attitude less than 5 deg noseup.  For the two lighter GW STOs, pilots commented on a small wheelbarrow tendency and minor control inputs.  For the STO at a GW of 54,982 lb, pilots commented that there was no wheelbarrowing and it was low workload.  All three STOs were rated as a DIPES 1 Therefore, GW was determined to have a negligible effect on STO handling qualities and it was deemed safe to grant an envelope of +/- 10 deg of the bow out to 30 kt WOD for GWs up to 52,000 lb  Ship Motion\227 Since the most ship pitch/roll experienced during the day STO testing was 0.3 deg and 1 deg respectively, additional analysis was conducted to be able to grant the previous STO ship motion limits of +/- 2 deg pitch and +/- 3 deg roll for the recommended GW envelope  A performance analysis was conducted to determine additional ground roll distance required during a STO which occurred at the maximum ship pitch limit of 2 deg Analysis of land-based STOLCOMP takeoff and static  Figure 24 V-22 STO Envelope aboard LHD Class Ships 


  13 surface pitch calculations showed that at 52,000 lb, 35 deg C day, headwind of 25 kt, takeoff distance increased by approximately 0.5 feet/deg of surface pitch.  At these conditions, takeoff distances were approximately 30 feet Thus, assuming the 2 deg ship pitch limit, the ground roll distance would increase by approximately 3 STOLCOMP analysis showed that for 55,000 lb at 35 deg C and a headwind of 25 kt, takeoff distance increased by approximately 4 feet/deg of surface pitch.  At these conditions, takeoff distances were approximately 50 feet Thus, assuming the 2 deg ship pitch limit, the ground roll distance would increase by approximately 16%.  The increase in ground roll due to ship pitch was calculated using the slope correction formula from a test pilot school flight test manual for land-based takeoff performance with the assumption that a 2 deg slope remained constant throughout the STO ground roll  Land-based fl i ght  t e st  data were evaluated to determine the effect of ship pitch on ground roll.  A land-based STO was conducted at a GW of 52,725 lb with a pressure altitude of 23 feet and OAT of 23.9 deg C and resulted in a ground roll of 36 feet and takeoff velocity of 14 kt.  The ground roll distance increase due to a 2 deg slope was approximately 6.3 feet, which accounted for a 17.5% increase in ground roll  From a handling qualities perspective, the proposed ship motion limits were the same as what was recommended from previous tests conducted at lighter GWs.  Previous tests conducted aboard USS SAIPAN \(LHA 2\ted in recommendations for ship motion limits of pitch +/- 1 deg and roll +/- 3 deg.  Tests conducted aboard USS WASP LHD 1\ resulted in recommendations that increased ship pitch motion limits to +/- 2 deg.  For tests conducted aboard USS SAIPAN \(LHA 2\, pilot ratings showed that little effort was required.  STO te sts aboard USS WASP \(LHD 1 were considered benign.  Due to the small ship motion limits being proposed and the benign handling qualities encountered at light GWs, it was not expected that unacceptable handling qualities w ould be encountered at GWs up to 52,000 lb  Based on the previous test data and analysis provided, safe STO operations could be accomp lished aboard LHD 1 class ships with ship pitch limits of   +/- 2 deg and ship roll limits of +/- 3 deg.  The recommended STO envelopes aboard LHD 1 class ships restricted ship pitch limits to +/- 2 deg and ship roll limits to +/- 3 deg, as shown in Figure 24 MROL Envelope Expansion A total of 11 MROLs were conducted completing 6 of the 52 planned MROL test points with required repeats.  Due to limited test time at sea, only MROL touchdown predictability and GW expans ion tests were conducted Table 2 provides a summary of conditions under which tests were completed Table 2.

Figure 26 presents stopping distance as a function of TSRTS for both touchdown predictability tests as well as GW expansion Note that touchdown predicta bility test points for TSRTS from 12 to 15 kt resulted in stopping distances from 89 to 121 feet.  Although there is so me variability in the stopping distance based on TSRTS, it was determined that 15 kt was appropriate TSRTS to allow a safe stopping distance and provide some margin of safe ty for variability in touchdown speed.  Test results demonstrated that MROL ground roll distances with TSRTS up to 22 kt could be achieved with the flight deck space availa ble aft of the island                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                20 075 272 060 272 045 272 030 272 015 272 345 272 000 272 330 272 285 272 300 272 315\272 30 25 10 5 35 kts 15 DIPES 1 DIPES 2 DIPES 3 DIPES 4 DIPES 5 DATA KEY Black Line:  Initial Test Envelope Gross Weight Color Key 48 klb Blue 51 klb Green 54 klb Orange                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                20 075 272 060 272 045 272 030 272 015 272 345 272 000 272 330 272 285 272 300 272 315\272 30 25 10 5 35 kts 15 DIPES 1 DIPES 2 DIPES 3 DIPES 4 DIPES 5 DATA KEY Black Line:  Initial Test Envelope Gross Weight Color Key 48 klb Blue 51 klb Green 54 klb Orange  Figure 25 MROL Data Fairing 


  14  The touchdown positions relativ e to the target touchdown point are presented in Figure 27.  Aside from the one outlier, pilots were able to accu rately land the aircraft within the touchdown zone.  The av erage touchdown position was approximately 9.3 feet beyond and 0.3 to the left of the target touchdown point Based on this data, the probability of landing longitudinally within +/-25 feet of the spot 9 mainmount markings was greater than 99 %. The probability of landing laterally within +/-3 feet of the spot 9 mainmount markings was greater than 99 %.  From this data, there was high confidence that pilots would be able to accurately place the aircraft within the touchdown zone  GW expansion tests continued using the TSRTS of 15 kt Note on Figure 26 that the increased GW did not change the stopping distance required for a given TSRTS.  As stated in the method of test, the torque on approach was monitored to ensure sufficient excess power wa s available to arrest rate of descent and waveoff on the approach.  The peak torque required on approach was plotted against referred GW as shown in Figure 28.  Even at the highest GW tested, a 33 torque margin was maintained throughout the approach Based on the GWs tested, the minimum WOD speed of 20 kt allowed MROL with sufficient power margin Handling Qualities\227 Throughout the touchdown predictability and GW expansion tests, pilots evaluated the handling qualities of the aircraft using DIPES.  Pilots noted the largest workload was in the lateral axis, getting lined up with the ship on short final.  The general pilot sentiment was that MROLs were a benign maneuver for the GWs tested.  In addition, the pilots commented that maintaining ground speed relative to the ship during a MROL actually created an easier approach than attempting to decelerate to a hover, reducing lateral workload as the aircraft crossed the deck edge.  The MROL technique was validated in the shipboard environment    CONCLUDING REMARKS  This paper has provided an overview of the test methodology used in order to conduct V-22 sea trials in support of increased shipboard STO capabilities for the fleet 3 Th e o b j ectiv es o f th is test were p artially m et.

  15 possibility of granting an envelope to the fleet exists  Further testing has been recommended to continue expansion of the day/night vision goggle STO envelope aboard LHD 1 class ship up to a GW of 58,000 lb for headwinds 0-45 kt and crosswinds of up to +/- 10 kt.  It has also been recommended to conduct further testing to gather required data to validate the STOLCOMP model in order to extrapolate beyond tested am bient conditions.  Future testing will also involve inve stigating the MROL technique for GWs up to 58,000 lb along with similar headwind and crosswind limitations  STO and MROL GW and wind envelopes are currently still under development for LHD 1 class ships but have made significant progress in terms of providing additional capabilities to the fleet.  Alt hough future testing has been recommended and is desired, the limited number of amphibious assault class ships and numerous operational commitments poses a challenge to completing these types of shipboard tests.  Until more accurate modeling and simulation tools become available to support shipboard envelope development, full scale sea trials, although costly and time intensive, will continue to be the way forward in granting increased shipboard capabilities to the fleet ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  The support from the crew of the USS IWO JIMA is greatly appreciated and acknowledged.  The efforts of the V-22 test team, along with Boeing Flying Qualities and Aerodynamics personnel, were invaluable in accomplishing this testing REFERENCES  1  Geyer, W., \223V-22 Ship Suitability Tests Aboard USS BATAAN and USS WASP\224, NAVAIR Report of Test Results, 27 September 2006 2  USNTPS-FTM-NO. 108, Fixed Wing Performance Chapter 9 Takeoff and Landing Performance, 30 September 1992 3  Geyer, W., Mitchell, V., Weinstein, D. \223V-22 Shipboard Short Takeoff \(STO\ Minimum Run-on Landing \(MROL\Report of Test Results, 14 October 2008  BIOGRAPHY  Jennie Mitchell is a 2006 graduate from Georgia Tech with a bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering.
