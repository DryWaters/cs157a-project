INTRODUCTION \nThe resolution of scientific instruments has grown \nexponentially, and the latest generation of atmospheric \nsatellites exhibit data volumes in the realm of tens of Terabytes \nto low Petabytes over years to decades of measurement.  \nClimatologists need to summarize entire instrument volumes \nby combining appropriate physics with statistical aggregation \noperators to compute global "climate trends These \ncalculations must be performed carefully and a processing \nworkflow is necessary to account for physical artifacts such as \norbital striping, spatial noise, and drifts in calibration.  \nFurthermore, the scientific community is pushing for the \nprovenance and reproducibility of experiments requiring \nadequate visualization and documentation of inputs for \npublication [1].  \nThe most popular statistical analysis tools in the \ngeosciences include MATLAB, ENVI/IDL, NCAR Graphics, \nGRADS, R, Fortran, Excel and others.  These tools provide a \nwide array of statistical functions, and many provide extensive \nvisualization and Earth-plotting packages.  However, they all \nrequire that the problem size must fit within RAM.  Moreover, \nas instrument resolution improves, Big Data Analytics tools are \nbecoming necessary in order to continue this analysis into the \nfuture.  For example, in order to calculate decadal trends in the \nOutgoing Longwave Spectrum \(OLS AIRS compressed nfrom AIRS has provided us insight to many of the processing \nchallenges unique to the analysis of highly structured yet \ngeographically skewed data records.  While data resolution has \nincreased, the limits of human comprehension remain constant. \n“Climate Resolution” is the solution in which data volumes are \nprogressively aggregated to very coarse summaries until the \nvolume becomes small enough to be plotted and interpreted by nexpert domain scientists.   \nGridderama is a statistical aggregation engine designed to \nmaximize interoperability with highly structured instrument \ndatasets.  Typically these datasets are provided natively as \ndense hierarchical directory structures or “Data Products” in \nstandard geosciences formats such as HDF or NetCDF.  \nGridderama attempts to treat this hierarchical data structure as \na first class Large Array Storage LAS data product directory \(large array smaller array nreproducibility, and goes the extra step to make this record \naccessible to others through a browsable web interface.  \nGridderama plots every data file from every intermediate data \nproduct and places these images in a similar hierarchical \ndirectory structure that can be browsed online.  This is \nimportant because a single very large outlier can disrupt many \nstatistical inferences.  It can be very helpful to drill down and \ndetect mistakes either in processing or in data, or to allow \nothers to review and investigate your published work nII. RELATED WORK \nA. Data Active Archive Centers \(DAACs DAACs Tens \nof Petabytes of high quality NASA data products that are well \ndocumented and tested and infer a large number of physical \nphenomena from Earth observing instrument records [2].  The \ndata products are hosted on FTP servers, and each product \nappears as a hierarchical directory structure on a single file \nsystem exhibiting data, metadata, timestamps, and often \nimages. The processing algorithms are developed by nauthorized science teams and endure a rigorous review process \nincluding the establishment of an Algorithm Theoretical Basis \nDocument \(ATBD PGE is a binary program \(often \n2013 IEEE 27th International Symposium on Parallel & Distributed Processing Workshops and PhD Forum\n978-0-7695-4979-8/13 $26.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/IPDPSW.2013.87\n2157\nwritten in Fortran or C ninfrastructure to parallelize and scale the execution of this code \nwithin a production environment.  The 


DAACs, however, are \nvery large divisions and cover an enormous breadth of  \ninstruments and retrieval algorithms requiring many teams of \nscientists and engineers to maintain [2, 3].  For example, the \nMODIS Adaptive Processing System \(MODAPS Moderate Resolution nImaging Spectro-radiometer nphysical parameters.  MODAPS requires thousands of active \nprocessors and hundreds of compute nodes [3], and is one of \nmany processing groups in the NASA EOSDIS effort spanning \na geographically distributed network of DAACs [2].  In this \npaper, we focus on a much more constrained problem to \nperform climate aggregations in a way that is lightweight, \nflexible, but scalable for a generation of instrument data \nproducts toward the calculation of climate trends. \nB. Scientific “Data-Cube” Databases \nArray databases are a more high level easier scientific community \nexhibits a relatively short history \(by database standards Beginning with RasDaMan in 1996 \n[4], there have been a number of systems that have pushed the \nboundaries toward the creation of agile Large Array Storage \n\(LAS nsystems decompose arrays into uniform \(or non-uniform methods to \nimprove the speed of query.  Furthermore, queries are executed \nusing a data parallel model because of the known \ndimensionality of a large dense array.  RasDaMan was the first \nimportant array query database, and was developed in 1996 \nalong with an array query language RasQL [4].  RasDaMan \nwas used in many scientific processing systems including the \nOpen Geospatial Consortium \(OGS WCPS 2005 RAM framework.  RAM \nsupports array parallel indexing by means of "Query \nFragmentation" patterns that break a query into multiple \nfragments that can be executed in parallel and aggregated to \nrecreate the final result 5]. \nSciDB,  presented by Rogers et al, \(2010 of large array \nstorage.  SciDB is unique because it is not dependent upon any \nrelational or traditional database system.  Another innovation \nof SciDB is the use of a tunable "overlap" of blocks, that for \ncertain queries such as stencil kernels, clustering, and other \nproximity information can improve performance by a factor of \n2 [6].  By eliminating all dependence on the relational model, \nSciDB can process instrument records using block parallel data \ndecompositions. \nPlanthaber et. al \(2012 nto the processing of the NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging \nSpectroradiometer \(MODIS instrument data.  \nTheir EarthDB system works because the instrument swath \ndata \(such as MODIS or AIRS well to the “Data-Cube” \nrepresentation, and can be statistically aggregated once it is \nloaded into the SciDB framework [7].  Unfortunately, the ETL \nphase remains a tedious bottleneck, and their current \nimplementation requires a sub-optimal series of conversions \nbetween binary and text formats.  Even if this pipeline were noptimized, storing the data to a non-native format would \nrequire extra disks if both datasets were to be maintained for \nprovenance reasons.  Gridderama by comparison can load these \ndatasets without translation because it works with data arrays \nas a hierarchical directory of flat HDF files, which is standard \nacross Earth Observing instrument records including MODIS \nand AIRS. \nC. Workflow Systems \nSeveral workflow models and tools such as Trident and \nPegasus are proposed for composing complex scientific \nworkflows and scheduling these workflows on a distributed \nheterogeneous resource environment such as Grids, clusters, \nand more recently onto clouds [8, 9, 10]. Pegasus is a \nworkflow management system which provides an interface to \nmap workflow specification onto the Condor system.  Then \nCondor allocates machines for the execution of jobs as ninstructed by Pegasus. DAGMan \(Directed Acyclic Graph \nManager ndependencies of Condor jobs by organizing jobs as directed \nacyclic graphs \(DAGs jobs and \nedges indicate dependencies [8]. Kepler is a scientific \nworkflow system, and provides a visual interface to create \nworkflows. It supports software or functional libraries as actors \n[10]. These systems meet some of the challenges and issues in \na scientific workflow and have been successfully applied in nscientific applications across many science disciplines. \nHowever, these systems either do not support parallel \nexecution on partitioned data or need to provide fully parallel \nexecution handling. These systems also lack adequate support \nfor data models, and high degrees of tolerance to failures for \nvery large data analysis problems at scale. Our work focuses on \nbuilding a workflow application \(case study nruntime system Gridderama providing fine grain parallel task \nexecutions with failure tolerance and provenance tracking. \nD. Swift Parallel Scripting \nAnother related approach was that of the Swift parallel nscripting language at U. Chicago \(2007  analysis scripting \nlanguage for the parallel execution of loosely coupled \ncomponents.  This is of great benefit because scientific \napplications often chain multiple processes together to perform \na single 


calculation.  Gridderama also utilizes loosely coupled \ncomponents called Product Generation Executables PGEs are first \nappended to a Jobfile queue, and then a runtime environment is \ninvoked which is responsible for scheduling and resource \nmanagement of these tasks.  Gridderama does not provide its \nown scripting language but the API is relatively simple, and \ncan be invoked from any language including regular shell \nscript.  We have included a bash script example of this syntax \nin Fig. 1 of Section III, showing how the AIRS monthly naggregate grids are computed from daily grids. \n2158\nE. Provenance and reproducibility \nScientific replication is a necessary condition for the \nwidespread acceptance of any new result.   Jansey describes n“The results and conclusions from one study obtained \nindependently in another” as the “scientific gold standard” \nfrom which analysis is measured [13]. In practice, however, \nsuccessful replication of another scientist’s results is a very \ndifficult problem even with published literature [14, 15].  An \nactive community is necessary to prove a single climate trend, \nand we are very fortunate that efforts of GISS Berkeley, \nHadley center and others have replicated the global surface \nwarming trend independently.  Likewise in 2005, the UAH and \nRSS groups have agreed upon MSU derived lower-\ntropospheric warming trends within 0.001K/y of each other, an \namazing result that required 15 years of scrutiny and countless \npublications to achieve. \nThe series of steps to derive a single result can be \nrepresented and stored as a “Provenance Graph”.  The \nprovenance graph describes the data flow from its initial \ninputs, algorithms, and connectivity to produce the scientific \nresult along with version numbers, timestamps, and other \ninformation [1].  Tilmes and Fleig \(2008 OMIDAPS processing centers [16].  The \nincorporation of provenance into Big Data Analytics \ninfrastructure is also an upcoming area.  Ikeda and Widom \n\(2010 released the PANDA big provenance system \n[17, 18].   The Swift language also has good support for \nprovenance tracking [11, 12]. \nGridderama goes one step beyond the tracking of \nprovenance by attempting to make this information accessible \nthrough an interactive web catalog.  By providing this \ninformation online, it is possible for one scientist to \ninteractively review another’s published results without \nneeding to download Terabytes of data locally.  Gridderama \nrecords the provenance information at a file granularity and \nprovides a visualization of all intermediate data products as \nwell as a detailed description that shows how the output results \ncan be tracked in order to resolve bugs and errors in scientific \nresults.  Provenance is a highly effective way to track down \nerrors in processing, and helps to ensure that scientific results \ncan be repeated and scrutinized. \nIII. GRIDDERAMA \nGridderama is a statistical product aggregation engine for nscientific calculations that shares some similarities between the \nDAACs as well as the LAS databases.  As an aggregation \nengine, it provides a set of core statistical operators that take \none \(or multiple products as input and produce another \nproduct as output.  Thus, Gridderama is capable of generating a \nlarge number of data products with a relatively small \nworkflow.  Each data product is stored in a hierarchical ndirectory structure using flat .hdf datafiles.  Netcdf support is \ncurrently in development.  The use of standard geosciences \nformats for all intermediate LAS helps to eliminate the ETL \nbarrier when interoperating with instrument records from the \nclimate and weather domains.   \nGridderama was designed for multivariate scientific array \ndatasets stored and addressed in a Network Storage model \n\(such as NFS, PVFS, or Luster and provides a Gridderama \nRuntime Environment, GRE that makes use of a master/worker \ntask pool to parallelize the computation of new data product \narrays using statistical Product Generation Executables PGEs OLS nAtmospheric Infrared Sounder \(AIRS ndemonstrated increased absorption of CO2, O3 and CH4 since \n2003 [20, 21]. This is a new climate result that requires the \naggregation of 55 Terabytes of Level1b radiances. Gridderama \nis open-source and, the entire computation of the AIRS 10 year \nclimate record is available online for inspection and \nvisualization at the following URL: \n http://bluegrit.cs.umbc.edu/~dchapm2/airs-grid \nThe available data begins with a 55 TB mirror of the input \nAIRS Level 1b radiance granules from Sep 1st 2002 thru Aug \n31st 2012, and ends with several 77 Kilobyte text-files \nshowing the decadal trends under various processing decisions. \nWe provide all of the gridded data products toward the \ngeneration of these trends.  Gridderama also maintains \nprovenance of the data flow for our portion of the processing \nchain by providing detailed log files at every step of the nproduction, and by keeping track of all data inputs.  Finally, we \nprovide a web based catalog infrastructure to easily visualize or \ninspect many data files at once.  Because manual inspection is \nsuch a powerful validation tool, every data file we have \nproduced has already been manually inspected and is available \nfor manual inspection by others. \nBecause the AIRS Level1b calibrated dataset is 55 \nTerabytes in size, we 


recommend a Linux cluster with 10+ \nIntel x64 nodes, and ~70 Terabytes of available network \nstorage.  The software dependencies are: gcc, bash, python, \nlibhdf4, libjpeg, libz, libpng, ssh, gnuplot, and imagemagick nThe total output size of our monthly gridded products is \n~300GB \(compressed and a \nsingle monthly array \(ascending and descending compressed degree Lat-Lon \ngridded products that total ~9 Terabytes in output size.  These \nproducts are available for quick inspection through our browser \nbased "data catalog" service. \nA. Parallel Execution \nAt its heart, a climate job involves aggregating a large array \ndataset to produce a coarser resolution version. Although a full \ndata analysis requires a complex workflow, any individual task \nof this workflow is a simple data parallel operation. A “Product \nGeneration Executable” \(PGE parallelized [2, 3].  A data-parallel \noperation can be described using nested data parallel for-loops \nover the dimensions of the datasets.  This process is \nembarrassingly parallel because each array element \(file nindependent of the others and need not communicate.  \nGridderama provides a workflow scheduling runtime nenvironment \(Described in section IV this data-parallel \nplatform. \n Figure 1 shows an example shell script \(bash AIRS OLS grids from daily AIRS OLS \ngrids by using an exhaustive for loop.  The PGE’s are \nappended by means of a parallel Jobfile over the dataset which \nwe have implemented by using a workqueue shell-script.  Then nthe Gridderama Runtime Environment \(GRE written \nin any language and we can deploy PGEs to create hierarchies \nof images, graphs, or even html webpages all of which are \ncreated in parallel by using the same workqueue process.  \n \nFig. 1. Shell script bash max” operators. \nAs can be seen in Fig. 1, the aggregation is written as \nnested for-loops over the dimensions that append to a jobfile \n“$q”.  The last line executes this job-file in parallel.  The \norange bracket represents the outer dimensions \(year, month, \nday/night, and PGE nfour basic statistical operators \(average, median, min and max dimension.  The red \nbracket shows the sub-dimension: day-of-month, which \nspecifies the input dimensions Lines 9 and 12, show how \nthese dimensions are concatenated to index into the \nhierarchical directory structure.  Line 19 executes this entire \njobfile in parallel using the workqueue process. \nIV. GRE RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT \nThe Gridderama Runtime Environment \(GRE workflow processing. \nGRE is a parallel runtime system that is designed to create and \nmap very fine grained tasks to computing resources. GRE \nselectively replicates tasks to circumvent faulty compute \nresources and network connections, as opposed to a \nsynchronous checkpoint/restart of an entire application. This is \ndone without the need for explicit message passing within the \napplication. Our runtime environment uses data parallelism at \nthe loop level to execute individual operations on multiple data \nsources, and remote compute resources. By gathering and \nusing runtime performance metrics to both effectively scale \nand manage computational tasks and resources, this system \ndemonstrates not only more effective utilization of ncomputational resources, but improved application scalability, \nand performance. GRE provides runtime resource \nmeasurement analysis and strategically maps I/O and compute \nintensive tasks onto heterogeneous resources using a shared \ntask, master-worker parallel programming paradigm as shown \nin Fig. 2. This is a reasonable approach because it is naturally \nfault tolerant and scales well once a problem has been broken ndown into independent subproblems. GRE incorporates a \nfeedback mechanism that schedules and groups tasks together \nwith task level fault tolerance through voting and replication \nand requiring no additional programming directives or the need \nfor language explicit parallel constructs, such as Send  n \n \nFig. 2. GRE Shared task master worker paradigm \n \n \nFig. 3. GRE Process Overview \nA. Architecture \nThe GRE system is composed of three fundamental and \nseparate processes, each running as a concurrently executing nthread and communicating over sockets using custom \nmessaging interface over UDP. The primary communicating nprocesses are a manager, client, and one or many workers. \nThese are presented in Fig. 3, and their capabilities are \ndiscussed below. With regards to resiliency, periodic liveness \nchecks are performed. These checks determine if an application \nis not performing as anticipated. If an application thread is \ndetected as compromised during a liveness check, it will be \ndestroyed and replaced using the uncompromised residual nmembers of the group. This “hot-start” recovery mechanism \n[19] ensures that the newly recreated thread begins execution \n2160\nfrom the most recent state rather than a state where the \ncompromise occurred. \n A Client \nThe Client consists of an application programmer interface \nthat profiles an application, breaks it down into subtasks and \nsubmits these tasks to the manager via a ServiceRequest which is typically run in a traditional \ncluster environment is sent to the manager for use by the HPC \nsystem 


via SubmitData nListenforResponse Manager and \nManager to Client is on the order of tens of milliseconds when \nno Worker execution time is measured. \nB. Manager \nWhen the Manager is started a registration message from \nany participating Worker process from RegisterWorkers only requirements for either a Client or Worker \nare the ability to establish a socket connection to the manager. \nThe Manager then listens for a ClientRequest Client to populate it’s \ninterface listing. Once the Client has entered its parameters and \ndata location the message is sent to the Manager, who compiles \na list of capable Workers via CreateWorkerList ninformation the manager selects a subset of workers to perform \nthe execution of the client task\(s Manager logs each task \nin a local database, which can be used for task replication and \nvoting. When the Manager receives a response from the pool of \nworkers the manager checks for correctness is made and the nresults are sent on to the Client. \nC. Worker \nEach Worker sends a status message to the Manager that ncontains a ”Characteristics” structure which outlines its \ncomputational capabilities, such as load average number of \ncores, core frequency, memory in use, memory available, \nbandwidth to local storage, bandwidth to remote storage and or \nwhether or not a GPGPU is present, this structure is presented \nin Listing 1. The Worker then polls a work queue and if it is \nlisted for job execution it then executes the job and submits the nresults to the manager. The worker then updates an \n“Experience” structure as shown in Listing 2 with new ninformation that can be used by the manager making task \nplacement decisions. \n      \nListing 1.  Worker Characteristics shared structure \n \n        \nListing 2.  Worker Experience shared structure \n \nV. CASE STUDY AIRS OLS CLIMATE TRENDING \nPolar orbiting weather instruments exhibit complicated \nscan geometries, and the data distribution is highly skewed. \nFig. 4. shows the number of daytime AIRS measurements per \ngridcell for a daily and a monthly average.  The Aqua satellite \norbits in a sun synchronous manner at 805km altitude in near npolar orbit.  As a result, the poles are measured very frequently \n\(14 times per day sampled much more \nsparsely \(less than once per day a lat-lon projection \(striping nLat Lon resolution. \nOur goal was to compute the decadal trends in Outgoing \nLongwave Spectra \(OLS AIRS, a calculation that \nprovides new insight to the Earth’s radiative budget.  Because \nAIRS has 2378 spectral channels spanning most of the Infrared \nspectrum, it provides the first direct measurement of changes in \noutgoing longwave atmospheric absorption by Greenhouse \ngasses including Carbon Dioxide, Ozone and Methane 20, 21, \n22, 23].  The data intensive nature of this calculation required a \nparallel workflow to maintain exhaustive provenance and \nvisualization.  In this section we describe the workflow that \nwas implemented to accomplish this goal. \nA. AIRSC2X2 Processing Workflow \nThe workflow for these data products is represented with a \nsingle short bash shell script \(appropriately labeled “run.sh daily products, and daily \nproducts are produced from the Level 1b orbital granules.  Fig. \n5 shows a diagram of the data flow to produce all of the \ngridded data products.  All of the daily and monthly products \n\(square corners Nov \n17th 2003, and Jan 9th thru Jan 26th 2010.  Thus, this \ncomputation is performed twice: once without and once with \nfill data for the three week periods of AIRS inactivity.  The \n“Filled” data products use daily climatology’s to augment the \n2161\nmissing data days.  Thus the filled daily products require both \nthe daily images and the daily climatology’s.  This workflow \nis described in Figure 5.  \n  \n \nFig. 5.  Workflow graph of the AIRSC2X2 Data Product. Each box \nrepresents a separate LAS data product. \n \nA “Climatology” \(or inter-annual mean or month For instance, the September climatology would be the \ngridded average of all 10 Septembers within the dataset An \n“Anomaly” is defined as the difference of a specific day \(or \nmonth or month September climatology. \nB. Monthly Average Dimensionality \nThe AIRSC2X2 “Data-Cube” representation is used to ndescribe all of data products that were produced to perform the \ncalculation of AIRS OLS trends. The first three dimensions: \nLongitude, Latitude, and Spectral Frequency represent a \nstandard 3D geo-image.  Additional dimensions include the \nday of year, the diurnal phase \(day/night average min, max, or count contiguously measuring and recording data at a \nuniformly sampled rate.  Table 1 shows the dimensions of this n“Data Cube”.  This is an 8-D array.  All of our gridded data \nproducts thus far contain all \(or a subset of these 8 \ndimensions. Monthly anomalies would exhibit the same \ndimensions whether the computations include 


fill data or not.  \nTherefore our workflow can compute cross-comparable \ngeophysical trends from any of these intermediate data \nproducts \(in Fig 5 representation shown in Table 1. \n \nTable 1.  Eight dimensional array representing the decadal gridded nhyperspectral monthly averages within the AIRSC2X2 gridded data product. \n We also see in Table 1, that the three spatio-spectral \ndimensions \(Lat, Lon, Spectral Channel I. E. they reside within a single file nencoded into the hierarchical directory structure.  The \n“external” dimensions are slash delimited directories that use a \nshort string to represent the column identifier.  Some Product \nGeneration Executable PGEs For example, if we wish to perform a “weighted \ntime series average” of daily average Brightness Temperature n\(BT number of footprints per grid rather than splitting these records into multiple \narrays.  We also provide additional “txt” files to represent \nprovenance and error logging for any a given data record. \nAn example of the Gridderama directory structure \nimplementation is described in Illustration 1.  All of our data \nproducts use the same directory structure.  All of the data \nproducts reside within the “storage area”, and are given a \nparticular product-name”.  Everything after the “product \nname” represents the “array” dimensions that are slash ndelimited. \n \n \nIllustration 1.  Example of a Gridderama file path for a daily gridcell average. \nC. AIRSC2X2 Gridded Dimensionality \nSome of the AIRSC2X2 gridded data products have slightly \nfewer dimensions \(7 or 6 This makes these data products a \nsubset of the total number of dimensions.  The daily grids do \nnot contain a monthly averaging strategy” dimension, \nbecause they are not monthly averages \(dim8 contain the “yearly” dimension \(dim6 the length of \ndim. 5 \(Day or Month of year or 366 days whereas the \nmonthlies have 12 months.  These differences are described in \nTable 2. \n2162\n nTable 2.  Major data products \(vertical horizontal dimension exists for that data product. \nD. AIRS Regional Averages and Trends \nThe regional averages are computed from a multivariate \narray of tabular CSV formatted regional BT averages stored in \na consistent text format also encoded as a hierarchical directory \nstructure.  These tabular arrays are computed for many zonal nmeans.  Table 3 shows a description of the regions for which \ntabular csv information is provided.  These zones were selected \nto provide trend analysis over latitudinal belts and other \nstandard geographic areas. \n nTable 3.  Regions selected for spectral trend graphs. \nE. Data Catalogs \nGridderama provides a catalog system to browse images for \nall of the data, and allows users to inspect large portions of the \ndata at once by displaying hundreds of images on a single \nwebpage. This system allows instant point and click access to \nview any portion of the dataset.  Our data catalog is a low \nlatency web interface designed to allow the user to inspect a \nlarge portion of the data as quickly as possible essentially by \nsplaying out slices of the “Data Cube”.  For this reason, we \npre-computed all of the images available for inspection through \nthe catalog, and these images are stored in a hierarchical \ndirectory structure.  The data catalog is also a powerful n“debugging” tool.  It is very easy to accidentally produce large \nvolumes of erroneous output.  Extensive visualization from the \ndata catalog system has been very helpful for us to detect \nobvious data problems often fixable using the provenance \ninformation and detailed logs provided at file granularity. \nThis data catalog system also provides the data user with \nthe necessary empirical evidence to explore the data and form nhypotheses.  Figure 6 shows a screenshot of the catalog \nbrowsing system for a filled daily data product.  We are \ndisplaying 365 images on a single page, by clicking the buttons \non the “Navigate” panel we may walk through any part of the \nlarge data array instantly on click. \n \nFig. 6. Screenshot of the data catalog system for the ascending filled daily \nAIRSC2X2 product. \nVI. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS \nIn order to evaluate the flexibility and scalability of our \nworkload runtime environment, we developed a benchmark \nrepresentative of the gridding workload. The benchmark \nperforms a global monthly means calculation for 12 months of \ndata. We have a total of 30 200MB files representing each \nmonth.  We ran our experiments on a 10 node Linux Cluster nwith each node consisting of dual quad-core Intel Xeon E5504 \n\(Nehalem compute \ncores per node.  Each node had 26GB of main memory and all \nfiles were accesses from a single directory mounted over NFS. \nThe network interconnect was Gigabit Ethernet.  \nWe performed a strong scaling study to evaluate the \nperformance of the GRE when adding nodes to the fixed \nworkload benchmark. We ran a single manager process on a \ndedicated node and up to 9 worker processes. Each worker \nperformed a single month global mean calculation, thus \nperforming a read, summation and average on 30 200MB files \nover NFS 


nThe client process contained a loop that dispatched a task to \nthe manager for each month. The GRE manager used round \nrobin task placement to place each mean calculation on a single \nnode, and wrapped around the available resources. Our \nperformance metrics involved an average between five timings \nof the execution of the entire yearly workload from the client \nusing the Unix time command. \nFig. 7 represents the scaling of the GRE system on the \nannual mean benchmark for up to 9 compute nodes. The x-\naxis is the number of nodes performing the concurrent \nexecution of the benchmark, and the y-axis is the total \nworkload runtime in seconds. The ideal curve demonstrates \nperfectly linear scaling. Our measurements show very good \nscaling which is expected due to the simple parallelism \n2163\ninherent in the data and computational layout. However our \nmeasurements show performance flattens out after five nodes, \nthis is due to bandwidth saturation for NFS. For GB Ethernet \nthis is around 120 MB/s, which is reached when using 5 nodes n120MB/s=\(\(360*200 months, we had \nmore than 2 jobs running on each node for experiments run \nbelow 6 nodes. \n \nFig. 7.  Strong Scalability analysis of the Monthly Mean Workload from.  Red \nline shows ideal scalability \(by extrapolation nVII.  CONCLUSION \n We present Gridderama, a statistical aggregation engine \nfor large structured data records that is designed for out of the \nbox compatibility with geoscience datasets.  Further our case \nstudy and specific workflow implementation enable climate \ntrending analysis of a 55 Terabyte decadal record of Outgoing nLongwave Spectrum \(OLS AIRS nGridderama is its handling of hierarchical directory structures \nas a “Data Cube” representation for statistical aggregations. \nThese aggregations can be executed in parallel with good \nscalability using the GRE runtime environment.  One of the \nlimitations of Gridderama is its requirement for IO Bandwidth \nto and from the filesystem and we were limited in our results \nby Gigabit Ethernet.  As a future direction we plan to nexperiment with the scalability on clusters/clouds with faster \ninterconnect to IO.  Finally, we would like to extend \nGridderama to a few more of the many highly structured \nscientific instrument records that adhere to the ”Data cube” \ntopology. \nREFERENCES \n \n[1] Moreau, Luc, Ben Clifford, Juliana Freire, Joe Futrelle Yolanda Gil, \nPaul Groth, Natalia Kwasnikowska et al.

Codeword buffering delay – we assume the \ncodeword frame synchronization mechanism will \nrequire 3 code frames to acquire and to confirm \nframe sync.  Let R denote the data rate.  Thus the \ncodeword buffering delay for DSN missions and \nSN/NEN missions are 3x2048/R and 3x4500/R \nrespectively \(in unit of seconds 


Frame buffering delay – we assume a Space Link \nExtension \(SLE acquired and confirmed in one frame.  \nThus the frame buffering delay is 10240/R \(in unit \nof seconds Ground transmission delay – from prior statistics \nfor DSN data delivery over the NISN lines, we \nobserve that the long-haul latency between DSN \nsites and JPL Central is approximately 2 times the \npropagation delay.  As ground transmission latency \nis a small fraction compared to the other delays, we \nuse the rough estimation of two times propagation \ndelay to model the ground transmission delay.   \n \nUsing the Straight-Forward Leveling Scheme we estimate \nthe link sizes of the network paths of the four ISE options \nfor the “base” case and high” case traffic scenarios, both \nfor bulk science latency requirements of 1 hour and 8 hours nrespectively.

All other links are store-and-forward links, and the \nlink sizes are driven by the combined effects of nmission data rates, data types with different latency \nrequirements, and duty cycles.   \n3. For ISE-3 and ISE-4, the aggregated WAN \nbandwidths are insensitive to data type latency \nrequirements as their WAN bandwidths are \ndominated by the real-time GSS-INOC links.   \n4. For ISE-4 with two different bulk science latency \nrequirements, the aggregated WAN bandwidths for \nthe high-case are only 20% higher than those of the nnominal case.  This is because the ISE-4 WAN \nbandwidths are dominated by GSS-INOC links that \ntransport RF/IF samples, and are independent of \nthe data rates.   \n5. For ISE-3, ISE-4, and ISE-5, the aggregated WAN nbandwidths of the “high” case are approximately \nthree times as those of the “base” case.  This is nconsistent with the fact that the “high” case \nconsists of future mission data rates that are 3 times \nthose of the “base” case.   \n6. The WAN bandwidths of ISE-3 and ISE-4 are \nmuch higher than those of ISE-1 and ISE-2.   \n \n \nV. CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE WORK \n \nIn this paper, we describe new leveling schemes to model \nthe traffic flow and buffering mechanism of a large-scale \nstore-and-forward network.  We apply these techniques to \nestimate the wide area network \(WAN options of the \nproposed Integrated Space Communication and Navigation \n\(ScaN improve the fidelity \nof the leveling schemes and enhance the INA Study are as \nfollows:   \n1. Use statistical description to define link bandwidth \nrequirements.  The current analysis uses the min-\nmax approach to estimate the link sizes of a \nnetwork as described in Section 4.  A better \napproach to quantify the link sizes is to describe \nthe individual link size in terms of mean and \nvariance based on the simulated traffic that flows \nthrough the link.  By invoking the Gaussian \nassumption and using the 2nd order statistics ngathered from the traffic flow simulation, one can \nspecify the link sizes based on the statistical nconfidence level to prevent overflow.   \n2. Provide data type modeling for each individual \nmission.  The current analysis makes blanket \nassumptions on mission data types across all the \nmissions as described in 


Section 4.  When data \ntype allocation information is available for an \nindividual mission, we can implement the specific \ndata type allocation for that particular mission to \nimprove the simulation fidelity.   \n3 Include other latency contributions.  The current \nanalysis only models the store-and-forward delay \nbased on the latency requirements of the data types, \nwhich accounts for the majority of the latency in \nthe data delivery operation.  We can improve the \naccuracy of the analysis by modeling the additional \nlatency contribution of codeword buffering delay, \nframe buffering delay, and ground transmission \ndelay as described in Section 4.   \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \nThe authors would like to thank John Segui for his \nengineering and simulation support, and Loren Clare for his \ninsightful comments.

Evolutionary game modeling can derive sustainable or survivable strategies \(mapped from the ESS in EGT such as node failures such as security compromise level modeling in the so-called three-layer survivability analysis developed in Ma \(2008a this article  v offer an integrated architecture that unite reliability survivability, and fault tolerance, and the modeling approaches with survival analysis and evolutionary game theory implement this architecture. Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
