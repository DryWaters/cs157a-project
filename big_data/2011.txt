It is useful and concrete to develop a model with some intelligent methods in artificial intelligence area for the prediction of some big structure projects. The validity of the models has been proved by some civil engineering practices Therefore, the research of bearing capacity and settlement characteristics of rigid pile composite foundation has been the focus of the basic engineering research area in foundations. This paper established a model based on the Gray RBF neutral network which is a combination of gray model and RBF neutral network model and realized the model with Matlab7.0 Keywords  Gray neutral network,  pile capacity  Prediction model  I  INTRODUCTION Typically, many measures have also been proposed and studied to quantify various aspects of rules, such as confidence, uncertainty, applicability, quality, accuracy usefulness and interestingness. As the association rules data mining model has extensive applications, which mainly process the concept forma tion and concept relation identification. The association rules mining has played an important role in data mining technologies. However, the association rules mining canít satisfy the massive or little data mining problems today. Gray neutral network is a natural mixture of gray model and neural network model, which contains the gray system that using small sample to model and neural networkís advantages in self-adaption to nonlinear and inaccurate regulations  The GA method is adopted to find the best fit of weights for each software effort driver in the similarity measures. Experimental results show that the software effort estimation using an integration of the grey relational analysis with GA method presents more precise estimates over the results using the case based reasoning classification and regression trees and artificial neural networks methods. The grey system theory is a useful method that is applicable to unascertained problems with too little data or information. Therefore, this paper is based on consulting massive related literature material, a study of artificial intelligent simulation identification research is carried on the Bearing Capacity of Pile Foundation  II  GRAY  RBF  NEUTRAL  NETWORK  MODEL Gray RBF neutral network is a combination of gray model and RBF neutral network model. Many experiment results had proved that the performance of this combination predicting model is better than the single ones. It has the advantage of gray system that using small samples to modeling and that of neural network in self-adaption to nonlinear and inaccurate regulations A  Gray theory model As we know, AGO GM \(1,1\odel is usually applied to one dimension grey problem. The model is a time series forecasting models, encompassing a group of differential equations adapted for parameter variance, rather than differential equation.  In this paper, we just have applied the AGO theory into Gary RBF neutral network  Denote system feature data sequence \(n measured values\ original sequence    2   1    0   0   0   0  n x x x X  1 Its 1-AGO \(accumulated generating operation\ sequence as follow   2     2   1   1   1   1   1  n x x x X  Where n k i x x k i k  2  1     0  1   1    002   B  RBF neutral network RBF neutral network is a three-layer forwards network.

In civil engineering, it is general considered that there are 2 main factors of  the Pile Capacity one is the Pile Parameter, the other one is the Geological Environment The Pile Capacity is the complicated composition including the sectional area, the pile length 001 the elastic modulus of material and the material density. According to the division of the Geological Environment into different soil layers, a single of pile may run though more than ten kind of soil layers.     Every soil layer contains the void ratio, the liquid limit, the plastic limit, the compression modulus, the blow count of standard penetration and other kinds of parameters However, the influence of Bearing Capacity of Pile Foundation is much more factors, and among these factors also have complex relationship. So it is difficulty to summarize the accurate calculation formation of the Pile capacity. Nowadays in engineering design , it is used the semiempirical theories which based on many experimental foundation. But out of safety considerations, it is always given the conservative design division, causing a certain waste. So there is an important problem ìhow to reasonably determine the Bearing Capacity of Pile Foundation during the pile engineering designing B  Structure strength There are so many factors which influence the structure strength of the bridge, that can come down to 3 aspects, such as the Environmental Factors, the load factors, and the material factors. According the above factors, it is certain to built the strength attenuation model  as        i ci s p t f R K K t R 007   p K is the uncertain stochastic variable s K is the teamwork coefficient of steel and concrete R  KÙK is the stochastic process which calculated the standard value of the lumped parameter and the material parameter The change of the structure strength can be divided to 2 stages in the general environment condition. At one stage which came from the built structureís time to c t the carbonation of concrete never reach the surface of steel so that the structure strength can not decrease. At the other stage which came from c t to T , the steel rusted so the structure strength continuously decreases. According the above research of the time-varied factors, it is easy to get the time-variant strength expression

Furthermore, it is easy and feasible to establish the model in the engineering  project. The accuracy prediction result will be helping for the capacity prediction and determination of the bridge project or some other structure projects V  CONCLUTION The precision of the model bases on the pile capacity which has average error is 6.215%   , and it is less than the  other result of the neural network model. This paper proposed the Gray neural network prediction model for the pile capacity application. The prediction data of this intelligent method has showed the better accuracy , so it is easy to get the precision of the Bearing Capacity of Pile Foundation in the project              R EFERENCES   1 Z h o n g L u o  Re se ar chi n g o f F o r w ar d G e ner a ting N e ur al N e tw o r k,  P r o c   of Inter.

The navigation system uses GPS to determine aircraft position and the mini inertial system to determine aircraft attitude Information is acquired every second and is compared to mission path parameters and terrain data base information previously obtained from 3D navigation charts. All information is properly proce ssed and the current position is shown to the pilot All hardware devices to the laptop computer are controlled by the navigation software. An external data file is loaded with the mission information plan by the navigation software The navigation software can manage the acquisition of mission and telemetry data, perform aircraft position and navigation calculations, present the results of the calculations in a graphic interface, manage the video images from the aircraft and build the visual and graphic interface to the user in real time This section presents the general development techniques used, as well as the structure and logic functioning of the navigation software.

However the main objective of the 3D Navigation Module is the 3D representation of navigation data to complete the navigation software In the following description we are not detailing the graphic computations, i.e. rotation matrix, translation and scale variation  We are just showing how to create a 3D navigator generator to be used with the navigation software Computation details are properly described in references such 8 and 9  In 1 0  one fi nd s a descri pt i o n o f t h e pertinent algorithms with calculation implementation. Thus implementation itself became relatively easy To clarify the use of geometric transformations and its use in the 3D generator software, [1 desc ri bes basi c s o ft wa r e  to manipulate and present a 3D cube using rotation translation etc In this software the geometric shape is a cube presented as 223wireframe\224. In order to do ge ometric transformations of the cube it is necessary to create a set of cube vertices coordinates. In this case ther e are 8 vertices and 12 line segments that join these verti ces. Three matrices are used to represent the coordinates of the vertices, one for each axis one for the X axis, one for Y and one for Z. Thereafter a segments matrix is created to represent the connection of those vertices, the line segments matrix Figure 9 shows the graphic representation of the 3D cube generated by the software sample from   Figure 9 \226 3D cube representation After choosing such cube representation with vertices and line segments, the next stage is to do the transformation calculations needed for gra phic presentation of moving objects. Specific algorithms were developed for rotation translation, scaling and pr ojection to show aircraft movement in the virtual environment  Figure 10 \226 Waypoint representation The same procedures are used in the 3D navigator generator. After the mission data \(coordinates\ read, the next step is the creation of the cubes that will represent the 223waypoints\224 


  6 After the cube representation in terms of vertices and line segments, the next step will be the determination of the cube position for each waypoint. This is done considering coordinate information of the respective waypoints by the navigation software. Figure 10 shows the cube representation at the waypoints Based on computer graphics and calculations of waypoint graphic manipulations, rotation, translation, scale variation and projection tools were developed that can be used in the representation of a real envir onment by a virtual one. The set of these tools was called 3D generator Math functions, e.g., matrix rotation, translation and projection in 3 axes were used as in [12 All p e rtinen t computer graphics components were used to build the 3D navigation generator software.

  7 Figure 13 presents and compares the results of the navigation software and the 3D navigation module. The mission used as example in this figure is the same mission described in the \223Flight Tests\224 section. Observe that it was possible to get the same waypoint representation using both options, the navigation software \(2D\nd the 3D navigation module \(3D  Figure 13 \226 2D route \(navigation software\ and 3D route 3D Navigation Module T ESTS  Ground Tests In the development of flight systems, ground tests are fundamental to reach the de sired reliability. As \223flight system\224 we consider the whole set of software and hardware subsystems, boards, gyros, etc Initially all systems components are tested individuality and then integrated. After integration and simulations, system ground testing starts   Figure 14 \226 Video camera, GPS and laptop installation In this manner it is guaranteed that no EMI 5 between the installed equipment will happen   5 Electronic Magnetic Interference  Figure 15 \226 Ground test location A car was used as mobile platform for ground testing. All components of the navigation system, hardware and software were installed on the car. Installation details are shown in Figure 14 As test area was selected considering heading, altitude speed variations and low traffic Figure 15 shows the chosen ground test place, located in Mogi das Cruzes, SP, Brazil  Figure 16 \226 SpyHawk test systems and navigation software working in \223simulate mode\224 Considering avenues and streets as regular way, the aircraft navigation route was built. Comparing the car path, through 


  8 avenues and streets, with the ai rcraft path, an offset error was found: the aircraft path length is different from the car path length. For the aircraft the total path length was 3975 nautical miles and for the car the total path length was 4120 nautical miles. The difference between the lengths is due to the different route alignments During the ground tests \(car\ two data files were generated to check the mission. One file contains the navigation data and the other contains a video recorded of the working software. Both files were compared. After this initial comparison, a second comparison was done, the video and data with the mission waypoints, defined before the test. For the bench test, the \223simulate mode\224 was set on the navigation software Figure 16 shows the mission done to test the simulated mode Flight Tests Like the ground tests, flight tests are very important to guarantee the perfect working of all subsystems. The same methodology described in the ground tests section was used to test the navigation system in flight. The only difference was the test platform, where a scale 1:1 aircraft was used The main idea to use a manned airplane was to verify and set the navigation system work in real time and during actual flight. The aircraft used for the tests was a Paulystar experimental aircraft used for pilot training \(see Figure 17 This aircraft has 2 seats, one of them for the pilot and the other for the co-pilot or a passenger. The cruise speed is 60 knots  Figure 17 \226 Aircraft used for flight tests During flight tests the video and telemetry links in real time were not used. Needed equipment was directly connected to the PC. The video link was replaced by a webcam that was installed on the airplane. Equipment installation for the flight tests is shown in Figure 18   Figure 18 \226 Video camera, GPS, laptop and Black Box installation \(Video camera recorder Flight tests took location in the area of Mogi das Cruzes and Biritiba Mirim \(see Figure 19\en waypoints were defined to build the mission route. These waypoints were via latitude, longitude and altitude coordinates. To validate the navigation software known locations were selected as waypoints, e.g., buildings, farms and specific locations in Mogi das Cruzes. After the selection of the waypoints and using a flight chart to get the altitude and position of the airport and waypoints, it was possible to create the flight route. The weather condition was a new factor that came into play during the flight tests. During ground tests, the navigation was through avenues and streets without the interference of winds and turbul ence. During the flight test the turbulence can interfere on the set altitude. The wind can interfere on the actual speed and a crossing wind can move the aircraft off the track. The estimated total mission length was 17515 nautical miles and the estimated flight time was 26 minutes. The coordinates of the mission waypoints are shown in Table 1 Table 1 \226 Coordinates / Altitude of flight test waypoints Wyt Latitude Longitude Altitude \(ft 001 -23.56456 -46.06809 2467 002 -23.54437 -46.16402 3900 003 -23.53682 -46.19960 3900 004 -23.52787 -46.14435 3600 005 -23.49994 -46.11372 3600 006 -23.53288 -46.08701 3300 007 -23.56456 -46.06809 2467   Figure 19 \226 Flight test location  


  9 For testing the functionalities of the guidance system different altitudes were considered for the waypoints. The guidance system helps the pilot to find the next route waypoint through a graphics indication of heading and altitude that the aircraft must fly to arrive to the next waypoint The take off was from waypoint 001, located on Hiroy airport in Biritiba Mirim. The local altitude was 2467 ft. The waypoint 002 was used as altitude \223check point\224, the desired altitude was 3900 ft. Keeping 3900 ft, the first visual validating point was the waypoint 003 \(a building\e second visual validating point was waypoint 004. Waypoint 004 was an old radio controlled plane runway, altitude 3600 ft. The third point was a little farm located in the middle of a valley, the waypoint 005. The fourth point was considered altitude \223check point\224, waypoint 006 with 3300 ft and Biritiba Mirim airport heading. The last point, waypoint 007 closed the mission route. The values of waypoint 007 are the same of waypoint 001 Figure 20 shows the waypoints 003, 004 and 005 respectively  Figure 20 \226 Waypoint 003, Building \226 004, old RC runway and 005, little farm  Together with the navigation test, the aircraft instruments\222 values and the software instru ments\222 values were compared throughout the flight. The following values were compared speed, altitude, heading and climb up/down The system was used for aircraft approach, final approach and landing, as shown in Figure 21  Figure 21 \226 Final landing approach After the tests, software \223bugs\224 were observed and eliminated, e.g., the climb indication. Data acquired throughout the flight test was used in simulations for further debugging C ONCLUSIONS AND R ESULTS  Based on the initial proposal of the development of an \223offthe-self\224 UAV system the following observations are considered especially relevant 200  The aircraft prototype should be stable in flight if it is to be used as a trainer, in order to minimize the control needs provided by the electronic equipment. It also defines the control methodology type.  Furthermore, the size, weight and cooling of electronic equipment will depend on the aircraft type. For example, the compartment size and the desired aircraft center of gravity \(CG\will define the position of every hard ware item according to its respective weight and si ze. Another important aspect is electrical power consumption that shall be as low as possible 200  For the airborne systems, it was possible to create limited avionics systems using COTS equipment e.g., the handheld GPS and COTS boards. The operational limit of such equipment will be defined by the type of the mission, in terms of distance and mission time. E.g., excessive accumulated GPS navigation error or the IMU reference attitude error could lead to catastrophic fault. It was observed that the main aspect of the use of COTS equipment is the integration methodology 


  10 200  It was demonstrated that it is possible to build a 223homebuilt\224 navigation system using \223off-the-self\224 equipment. In our case, a handheld GPS was used along with standard flight navigation techniques computer graphics and computer programming The navigation system was able to navigate through a preset route 200  In the 3D Navigation Module, it was possible to create a virtual 3D envir onment to represent the real environment, using points. The points are the 223waypoints\224 that were previously defined during mission route creation 200  It was shown that it is possible to navigate inside the 3D environment using some computer graphics methods and tools. Using navigation algorithms and some synchronism adjustment it is possible to build virtual tunnels to aid the pilot\222s navigation 200  For the ground station a main problem is the delay time, which should be as low as possible. The typical operation altitude lies between 20 and 2000 feet above the local terrain with a cruising speed of 100 km/h. Considering the aircraft control at an altitude around 20 feet above the local terrain flying at 100 km/h the \223r eal time\224 control must be the most \223real time\224 possi ble to keep the control under the typical operation conditions without a catastrophic event If regular use of the software in the aircraft / UAV is intended, still more time on ground / flight testing is recommended R EFERENCES   G Fahlst rom  and T h omas J.

assumes that around 20% of the attribute and text values are different from the template values Table 3 lists results from this experiment. The third column of the table shows the number of bytes transmitted for each sample document, while the 6 th column shows the time used to construct tokens from the compressed document. The table shows that, under above-described setup, the amount of data transmitted are reduced to 2.6% to 15.7% of the original size second column, listed in KB time is reduced to 5.4% to 11.3% of the Nature mode tokenization time, or 11.5% to 25% of the Swift mode tokenization time 5.5 Discussion Since in our implementations, we make changes to base systems \(KXML and XT changes are required to implement Structure Encoding performance differences demonstrated in this section are caused by differences in techniques rather than differences in implementations Our experiments clearly show that Structure Encoding can, potentially, greatly improve the efficiency of XML processing with relatively low penalty for worst cases. The worst case scenario happens when a receiver uses hash function to identify the structure of a document, only to find out that the document structure is not in cache. The penalty it pays for such worst case scenario, 11.1% for DOM-style parsing and 8.9% for transformation, can easily be compensated by future structure recurrence. Such cache-miss penalty is negligible when sender-assigning scheme is used Systems that are conscious of such client-side penalty can let the sender or anyone in the middle of the transmission path to assign ID without altering the semantics of the message or document Although we didnít measure the impact of compression on parsing and transformation, it can be inferred from tables 2 and 3. For example, in the book case, with tokenization time reduced from 8.6ms Swift mode\s \(compressed\e will likely be further reduced from 8.8ms to around 1.3ms compared with 24.4ms for KDOM\Similarly transformation time may be further reduced from 11.5ms to around 4.0ms \(compared with 48.3ms for XT\Encoding based XML compression offers additi onal, significant performance improvements for XML parsing and transformation in mobile environments, where closelycoupled proxies commonly exists. With compression turned off, Structure Enc oding is fully compatible with Web specifications and can be used between any two Internet hosts, and it still offer very significant performance improvements when there is structure recurrence Without compression, for documents with recurrent structures, tokenization and structure hashing cost dominates the overall cost for parsing, and is the major part of the cost for transformation. Tokenization and structure hashing however are relatively simple operations that may be implemented in hardware with low cost. \(In fact, some mobile chipsets already have hardware implementation of hash functions such as MD5 for security purposes implementation can reduce tokenization and structure hashing cost to a fifth of the current cost, then there will be additional substantial improvement for the parsing and transformation of most of the documents used in our experiments In our system, a document havi ng a structure slightly different \(e.g., added a new element\from a previous structure will not be able to reuse the structure processing result of the previous structure. However our system pays off as long as this new, slightly different structure recurs in future documents 6 CONCLUSION, LIMITATIONS, AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we motivated exploiting structure recurrence to speedup XML processing in mobile environments, by reduci ng structure related transmission and processing costs. We presented the concept of Structure Encoding, and described approaches to quickly identifying recurring structures including one using collision-resistant hash function We explained in detail how to use structure encoding to speedup XML transmission, tokenization, treebuilding, and transformation. We described our implementation of st ructure encoding based tokenizer DOM parser \(based on kXML\processor \(based on XT\pression scheme. Our experiments conducted on a mobile test-bed demonstrated dramatic performance improvement in the presence of structure recurrence and low overhead otherwise. In ideal cases structure encoding offers speedups of up to 7 for parsing and over 38 for XSL transformation, and up to 97.4% in size reduction when 20% of the text and attribute values change Structure encoding, however, is not applicable to all XML applications. Rather, it is more applicable to data-centric XML processing than to document-centric XML processing. A user randomly browsing Web pages is not likely to have high structure recurrence probabilities

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
