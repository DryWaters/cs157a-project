This paper takes an online bookstore platform as a background introduces the definition, functions, process and common analytical techniques of data mining. In the end, the experiment on association rules mining from the order data of online bookstore is completed by Apriori algorithm Keywords Online bookstore; Data mining; Association rule; Apriori Algorithm 1  Introduction Along with the development of the computer and the database technology, all trades and professions start to adopt the computer and corresponding information technology to carry on the management and the operation It has greatly improved the ability of producing, collecting storing and processing data. Under such a background people urgently need new com puting technology and tools to excavate the knowledge contained in database, which guides technological decisi on and strengthens the competitiveness of enterprises  Data mining has emerged as a means for identifying patterns and trends from a large amount major reason that data mining has attracted a great deal of attention in the information industry in recent years is due to the wide availability of huge amounts of data and the imminent need for turning such data into useful information and knowledge. Data mining can be viewed as a result of the natural evolution of information technology The paper is organized as follows. The definition process and techniques of data mining are introduced in section 2. The design and implement of online bookstore is introduced in section 3. In section 4, association rules mining and Apriori Algo rithm is introduced and experiments are conducted. The conclusions are discussed in Section 5 2  Data Mining Theory 2.1  Definition of Data Mining Simply stated, data mining refers to extracting or miningé knowledge from large amounts of data [1   D a ta mining is the process of disco vering actionable information from large sets of data. It uses mathematical analysis to derive patterns and trends that exist in data. Typically, these patterns cannot be discovered by traditional data exploration because the relationships are too complex or because there is too much data   These patterns and trends can be collected and defined as a data mining model. Mining models can be applied to specific business scenarios, such as   Forecasting sales   Targeting mailings toward specific customers   Determining which products are likely to be sold together 2.2  Data Mining Process Building a mining model is part of a larger process that includes everything from asking questions about the data and creating a model to answer those questions, to deploying the model into a working environment. This process can be defined by using the following six basic steps   Defining the Problem    Preparing Data    Exploring Data    Building Models    Exploring and Validating Models    Deploying and Updating Models  The following Figure 1 describes the relationships between each step in the process, and the technologies in Microsoft SQL Server that can be used to complete each step 1294 2010 IEEE 978-1-4244-6527-9/10/$26.00 Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics, Qingdao, 11-14 July 2010 


  Although the process illustrated in the diagram is circular, each step does not necessarily lead directly to the next step. Creating a data mini ng model is a dynamic and iterative process. After exploring the data, one may find that the data is insufficient to create the appropriate mining models, and that one therefore have to look for more data Alternatively, you may build several models and then realize that the models do not adequately answer the problem you defined, and that you therefore must redefine the problem. You may have to update the models after they have been deployed because more data has become available. Each step in the process might need to be repeated many times in order to create a good model   Figure 1. Relationships between six steps 2.3  Data Mining Techniques 1\on: di scovery of a predi ctive learning function that classifies a data item into one of several predefined classes. The typical method is fuzzy decision tree [5  7 2\gression: discovery of a predictive learning function, which maps a data item to a real-v alue prediction variable [8 3\ring: a common descriptive task in which one seeks to identify a finite set of categories or clusters to describe the data 4\Summarization: an addition al descriptive task that involves methods fo r finding a compact de scription for a set or subset\of data 5\ Dependency Modeling: finding a local model that describes significant dependencies between variables or between the values of a feature in a data set or in a part of a data set 6\hange and Deviation Detection  discovering the most significant changes in the data set 2.4  Data warehouses The data warehouse is a collection of integrated subject-oriented databases designed to support the decision-support f unctions \(DSF\re each unit of data is relevant to some moment in time. The function of the data warehouse is to store the historical data of an organization in an integrated manner that reflects the various facets of the organization and business A three-stage data-warehous ing development process is summarized through th e following basic steps 1\odeling: In simple terms, to take the time to understand business pr ocesses, the information requirements of these processes, and the decisions that are currently made within processes 2\ilding: To establish requirements for tools that suit the types of decision support necessary for the targeted business process; to create a data model that helps further define information requirement s; to decompose problems into data specifications and the actual data store, which will in its final form, represent either a data mart or a more comprehensive data warehouse 3\ To impl ement, relatively early in the overall process, the nature of the data to be warehoused and the various business in telligence tools to be employed; to begin by training users. The deploy stage explicitly contains a time during which users explore both the repository \(to understand data that are and should be available\nd early versions of the actual da ta warehouse. This can lead to an evolution of the data warehouse, which involves adding more data, extending historical periods, or returning to the build stage to expand the sc ope of the data warehouse through a data model 3  Design and Implement of Online Bookstore Based on ASP.Net An online bookstore is form ed by the front and back business subsystem. The website is built by Dreamweaver ASP.net, Microsoft SQL Server, etc. Visitors can  log in the online bookstore and choose books to buy. The whole shopping flowchart is as th e following Figure 2 4  The application of data mining in online bookstore As the running of online bookstore, it will produce a large number of orde r lists which contain customer's shopping information on the net.

System overall design flowchart 4.1  Association Rules Mining Association rules, first introduced  used to identify relationships among a set of items in a database These relationships are not based on inherent properties of the data themselves \(as with functional dependencies rather based on co-occurrence of the data items  Definition 1 Let I ={I 1 I 2 I m be a set of m distinct attributes, also called literals. Let D be a database where each record T has a unique identifier, and contains a set of items such that T  I An association rule is an implication of the form X  Y, where X, Y  I, are sets of items called itemsets, and XY  Here, X is called antecedent, and Y consequent Two important measures for association rules, support S\onfidence \(C\fined as follows Definition 2 The support \(S\an association rule is the ratio \(in percent\records that contain X Y  to the total number of reco rds in the database   X Y SX Y PX Y D    1 Therefore, if we say that the support of a rule is 5 then it means that 5% of the total records contain X  Y  Support is the statistical significance of an association rule Grocery store managers probabl y would not be concerned about how peanut butter and bread are related if less than 5% of store transactions have this combination of purchases While a high support is often desirable for association rules this is not always the case. For example, if we were using association rules to pr edict the failure of telecommunications switching nodes based on what set of events occur prior to failure even if these events do not occur very frequently associatio n rules showing this relationship would still be important Definition 3 For a given number of records confidence \(C\e ratio \(in percent\of the number of records that contain X  Y to the number of records that contain X   X Y CX Y PY X X    2 Thus, if we say that a rule has a confidence of 85%, it means that 85% of the records containing X also contain Y The confidence of a rule indicates the degree of correlation in the dataset between X and Y. Confidence is a measure of a ruleês strength. Often a large confidence is required for association rules. If a set of events occur a small percentage of the time before a switch failure or if a product is purchased only very rarely with peanut butter, these relationships may not be of much use for management Definition 4 The form of  mining rule is          up  P X customer W Q X Y buys X Z port confidence   In above form X is the keyword of relationship customer P and Q are predicate variables W  Y and Z are Object variables and their values are in the range of customer X  For example, a rule of age\(X, ç20É29 income\(X 40000É50000  buys\(X economic books   can tell us that a customer who is 20 years old and has a revenue between 40,000 to 50,000 most probably chooses economic books \(confidence is 60 4.2  Apriori Algorithm The Apriori algorithm developed by [3  is a great achievement in the history of mining association rules It is by far the most well-known association rule algorithm  Yes Registered users   Index page  To pick out and purchase Put selected goods into shopping cart To confirm quantity Go to cash desk  To register To Log in  Confirm the order and submit Fill in personal detailed information Finish shopping No 1296 Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics, Qingdao, 11-14 July 2010 


  The Apriori algorithm has two steps, During the first step, L k-1 is joined with itself to obtain C k In the second step, apriori_gen\(\deletes all itemsets from the join result which have some \(k-1\-subset that is not in L k-1 Then, it returns the remaining large k-itemsets [1 Algorithm : Apriori // To search all frequent itemsets Input: Database, D, of transactions; minimum support threshold, min_sup Output: L, frequent itemsets in D Method 1\ L 1 largel-itemsets 2\ FOR{k=2; L k-1   k++} DO BEGIN 3\ C k apriori-gen \( L k-1 min_sup  C k is the candidate set of k elements 4    FOR all transactions t D DO BEGIN  scan D for counts 5\      C t subset\( C k t  get the subsets of t that are candidates  6\    FOR all candidates c C t DO 7\     c. count 8\    END 9\    L k c C k c.countmin_sup 10 11\swer=U k L k  Procedure apriori-gen\( L k-1 generate candidate sets 1\ all itemset p L k-1 DO BEGIN 2 FOR all itemset q L k-1 DO BEGIN 3 IF p.item 1 q.item 1 p.item k-2 q.item k-2  p.item k-1 q.item k-1 THEN BEGIN 4  c=pq; //join step: generate candidates 5 IF has_infrequent_subset\(c, L k-1 HEN 6 delete c; //prune step: remove unfruitful candidate 7 ELSE add c to C k  8 END 9\rn C k  Procedure has_infrequent_subset\(c, L k-1  use prior knowledge 1\ FOR all \(k-1\subset s of c DO 2 IF s 012 L k-1 THEN 3 Return TURE 4\FALSE 4.3  Experiments The experiment on association rules mining from the order data of online bookstore is completed by Apriori algorithm.  We set 623 sales records in database as the data source and set up the following four tables to support the algorithm  1\able BookName: To store book ID and book name T ABLE 1  B OOK N AME  Column Name Data Type Length ID int 4 Name nvarchar 255  2\Table OrderList: To store book order lists T ABLE 2  O RDER L IST  Column Name Data Type Length ID int 4 Orders nvarchar 255  3\able RealItemList: To store frequent itemsets and their supports T ABLE 3  R EAL I TEM L IST  Column Name Data Type Length ID int 4 ListNumber int 4 RealOrders nvarchar 255 Support int 4  4\ Table ConfidenceDegreeList: To store all items above confidence  T ABLE 4  C ONFIDENCE D EGREE L IST  Column Name Data Type Length ID int 4 NowBooks nvarchar 255 MoreBooks nvarchar 255 ConfidenceDegree float 8  Rule support and confidence respectively reflect the usefulness and certainty of discovered rules. In our experiment, The parameter support is set to 2%  and confidence is taken to be 60%. We set 623 items in the data source of customersê orders ta ble and get 286 association rules. Finally, part of frequent itemsets is as the figure 3 and part of  association rules is as the figure 4 5  Conclusions In this paper, an online bookstore was created based on Asp.net. Then an experiment analyzes customer buying habits by finding associations be tween the order items in database. The discovery of such associations can help retailers develop marketing strat egies by gaining insight into which items are frequ ently purchased together by 1297 Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics, Qingdao, 11-14 July 2010

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
