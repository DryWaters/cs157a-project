components for this satellite class is rising. This paper presents Astro- und Feinwerktechnik Adlershof GmbH \(AFW\ttitude control components including the reaction wheel family starting from RW1 for Cubesats to the RW260 with up to 12 Nms angular momentum. The performance of the RW90 and the gyro system on the TET-1 satellite mission is discussed and lessons learned derived from observations of the components behavior are presented Most of AFWs attitude control components are smart components, meaning that they have data processing capabilities. They have a digital interface and can also provide telemetry information and include software models that model 
and control disturbing influences like temperature gradients or friction. Smart sensors will filter their measurements, so that their performance is increased The smart components are easy to integrate, time saving and require a less complex attitude control software on board the satellite. With smart components, a modular satellite is possible, where integration and on board software development time is greatly reduced. The required software for the component is developed by the manufacturer; therefore it is especially adapted to the physical properties of the smart component and thus tends to enhance the precision and reliability of the component much more than software

2  AFW S A TTITUDE C ONTROL C OMPONENTS  The reaction wheel family AFW develops, manufactures, assembles and tests components for attitude control systems, in particular reaction wheels for small satellite s. They are so called smart reaction wheels. An optical transmissive feedback system in combination with model based controller algorithms makes AFW\222s wheels the ideal solution for zero-momentum attitude control strategies because they will operate with high accuracy as well in the \223low wheel speed region\224 AFW integrates state of the art technologies like digital electronics and interfaces, micro vibration management and 
optimized balancing in its reaction wheels during the AIV Assembly, Integration and Verification\ process Furthermore modern materials like rare-earth elements for the rotor and tungsten-sulfide coatings in the ball bearings are utilized in AFW\222s family of reaction wheels The RW1 The intention behind the development of the RW 1 was to design a cost effective, but very accurate and smart reaction wheel for pico satellites, especially for Cubesats. Hence commercial off-the-shelf \(COTS\ic devices were utilized in the design. The design of the wheel drive electronic circuitry \(WDE\lso takes the substitution of space parts for COTS parts into account 


  2  Figure 1 \226 RW 1 The RW 1 uses a proportional-plus-integral controller. A functional unit of the RW 1 reaction wheel consists of one to four wheels and the external control circuitry. The WDE serves as the interface between wheel and user, providing control of wheel revolution and acceleration as well as communication with the user The RW 1 is flight proven \(TRL 9\d has flown on TUB\222s 223BEESAT\224 pico satellite and Nano-JASMINE  Figure 2 \226 Four RW1s in a tetrahedron configuration Table 1 - RW 1 characteristics  Performance Type A Type B Angular momentum 8000 rpm \(Nms 5.8\22510 4 1\22510 4  Nominal rotation speed \(rpm 8,000 8,000 Maximum rotation speed \(rpm approx 16,000 approx. 16,000 Nominal torque \(Nm 23\22510 6 Nm 23\22510 6 Nm Mechanical Mass \(kg 0.045 0.045 Moment of inertia rotating mass, kgm 2  694.5\22510 9 119.5\22510 9  Electrical Voltage \(V 5 5 Power consumption W\om, max 0.620 0.720 0.460 0.660  The RW 35  Figure 3 \226 RW 35  The RW 35 reaction wheel is a further development of the RW 1 and RW 90 reaction wheels and will incorporate the advantages of both wheels. Equivalent to the RW 1 design the design of the WDE of the RW 35 also takes the substitution of space parts for COTS parts into account The RW 35 was developed for microsatellites with a mass of 10 up to 60 kg. It is equipped with integrated digital electronic circuitry for operation in various modes and extensive self-diagnosis capabilities The RW 35 has the following standard modes of operations Mode 1 \(speed control  The first mode of operation is a speed control mode. When commanding a rotation speed it will accelerate up to the commanded rotation speed and hold it Mode 2 \(acceleration control  The second mode of operation is an acceleration control mode. When commanding acceleration, the wheel will be accelerated up to maximum speed \(whilst no other acceleration or speed will be commanded Mode 3 \(speed and acceleration control  The third mode of operation combines Mode 1 and Mode 2 In this mode the command will include a target rotation speed and acceleration. After receiving the command the RW 35 will be accelerated up to target rotation speed with the commanded acceleration and then it will hold the commanded speed

The satellite\222s design lifetime was required to be one year. Consequently the first RW 90s were designed for a design service life of about one year, too. All wheels were operating much longer than the design lifetime The intention behind the development of the RW 90 was to design a cost effective but very accurate and smart reaction wheel. Hence, COTS electronic devices were utilized in the design The experiences collected during the operation on BIRD led to the advancement of the RW 90. Some minor changes in the mechanical design, electrical design and the supervision of the reaction wheel were implemented and the design service life was extended to 3 years in LEO. On TET-1 the RW 90 is used for three-axis-stabilization Currently a program is running to extend the design service life of the RW 90 to up to five years in LEO Table 3 - RW 90 characteristics  Performance  Angular momentum @ 7800 rpm \(Nms 0.34 Nominal rotation speed \(rpm 6,000 Maximum rotation speed \(rpm approx. 7800 Nominal torque \(Nm 0.015 Mechanical  Mass \(kg 0.9 Moment of inertia \(rotating mass, kgm 2 4.2\26710 4  Electrical  Voltage \(V 18 to 34 Power consumption \(W\om, max 3.5 15  The RW 150  Figure 5 \226 RW 150 [1  The RW 150 reaction wheel is a further development of the RW 90 reaction wheel. It has nearly the same electronic devices as the RW 90. The mechanical parts of the RW 150 are designed for higher torque and higher angular momentum The RW 150 is a smart reaction wheel. It can perform four different operations based on three control modes 


  4 Mode 1  The first mode is a controller with proportional characteristic which controls the rotation speed of the reaction wheel. It has a relative high control deviation Mode 2 \(A - speed control, B - acceleration control  This mode is a controller with proportional-plus-integral characteristic which control the rotation speed or the acceleration of the reaction wheel. It can compensate the deviation of the position during the acceleration phase automatically by short overshooting Mode 3  This mode is a Kalman filter based state controller. It is controlling the acceleration of the reaction wheel. This is the most accurate mode Further features of the RW 150 are settable delay time selectable power modes, estimation of acceleration reserve and protective mechanisms. The settable delay time allows the simultaneous execution of the wheel commands of all wheels if using more than one wheel in the same bus The RW 150 has different power modes for estimation and limitation of the power consumption of the reaction wheel It also estimates its acceleration reserve depending on the actual speed and the available power The protective mechanisms contain a protective circuitry monitoring of temperature, voltage, currents and data stream Table 4 - RW 35 characteristics  Performance  Angular momentum @ 5000 rpm \(Nms 1 Nominal rotation speed \(rpm 5000 Maximum rotation speed \(rpm approx. 6000 Nominal torque \(Nm 0.03 Mechanical  Mass \(kg 1.5 Moment of inertia \(rotating mass, kgm 2 1.9\26710 3  Electrical  Voltage \(V 18 to 34 Power consumption \(W\om, max 5 30  The RW 250  Figure 6 \226 RW 250 The RW 250 reaction wheel is based on the RW 90 and has the same controller and characteristics as the RW 90 and RW 150 Table 5 - RW 250 characteristics Performance  Angular momentum @ 7000 rpm \(Nms 4 Nominal rotation speed \(rpm 6000 Maximum rotation speed \(rpm approx. 7020 Nominal torque \(Nm 0.1 Mechanical  Mass \(kg 2.7 Moment of inertia \(rotating mass, kgm 2 5.5\26710 3  Electrical  Voltage \(V 23 to 34 Power consumption \(W\om, max 2 150  The RW 260 The RW 260 is developed to be the biggest RW of the RW family by AFW. It will have an angular momentum of 15 Nms while its mass will be below 5 kg. Its model based controller will be the same as the controller of the RW 90 and RW 150. While currently in development, the first EM is planned to be ready by the end of 2014 and the first flight is expected in 2017

It is equipped with a digital serial interface \(standard interface: RS485\e serial interface speed and acceleration are directly commanded to the reaction wheel. The integrated speed or acceleration controller then executes the command. Furthermore, there are several telemetry data and parameter sets available which can be requested by the user A main error source for reaction wheels is overheating of the system. Hence a temperature monitoring and overheating protection mechanism is integrated into the wheel. Another protective mechanism is the redundancy of RAM parameters. The parameters are saved twice in the RAM. Both parameter sets will be checked regularly by a

  8 obliged to understand all details of the reaction wheels.  For example the user doesn\222t have to know anything about the friction behavior, because the wheel controller compensates the effect. As a consequence the reaction wheel will be no longer the design driver for the attitudes system control frequency. The control cycle can be adapted to the sensor system \(e.g. the star sensor\. Star sensor update rates are typically in the range of 1 Hz. Hence the command frequency for the reaction wheel can be also reduced to 1 Hz and the overall computing system will be relieved 4  I N O RBIT P ERFORMANCE OF THE ACS AND T HE S MART C OMPONENTS  In this paper, the failure of one wheel is given as an example for the redundancy performance. Since the four reaction wheels are arranged in a tetr ahedron configuration, the failure of one wheel can be compensated by the remaining three wheels. In order to evaluate the performance and agility of the satellite bus in case one wheel is not active, a target pointing manoeuvre with four and three wheels is considered in the following. In Figure 14, the wheel states for these maneuvers are plotted It becomes obvious that the applied acceleration and deceleration match very well and so does the maximum slew rate of 0.5 deg/s. The slightly increased time for the slews \(1\d \(3\or the three wheel configuration results from a larger slew angle due to the distance between the Sun and the considered target at the specific manoeuvre time              Hence, the conclusion can be drawn that the agility of the satellite is not influenced by the missing wheel and therewith the redundancy performance meets all requirements As discussed in section 3, the reaction wheel reboots and reloads the operation parameters from the EEPROM, if irregularities are detected during comparison of the two parameter sets in the RAM. Single Bit errors occur quite regularly in orbit. The wheel automatically reboots itself and its status is communicated to the ACS, which would then not use that specific wheel in this control cycle. If those errors would not be logged, they would not be visible in normal TM data, because of a low TM frequency. The ACS and the wheels handle this error autonomously If loading of the wheel operational parameters from the EEPROM fails, default parameters will be set. Operating the wheel under that condition can lead to the failure of the wheel. Therefore, if the loading fails, the wheel will enter a dedicated error mode which can only be exited on telecommand 5  S UMMARY  AFWs smart components such as the family of reaction wheels provide many advantages compared to regular attitude control components and are suitable for many small satellite missions              0 7200 14400 21600 28800 36000 4320 0 0 0.5 1 RW 1 RW 2 RW 3 RW 4 4 wheels in control loop RW 1 not in control loop Relative time, s In Loop Not In Loop 2400 2800 3200 3600 4000 4400 4800 0 0.2 0.4 X Y Z Relative time, s Satellite rate| deg/s 1 2 3 37600 38000 38400 38800 39200 39600 40000 0 0.2 0.4 X Y Z Relative time, s Satellite rate| deg/s 1 2 3 Figure 14 \226 Wheel rate dur ing the nadir pointing manoeuvres with four wheels \(left\ and three wheels \(right, TET-1 orbit data 1\..

  9 The smart component approach yields main advantages considering development time and cost, since tasks hitherto performed by the on board computers are now integrated in the component itself. Furthermore, the overall system design is more robust and reliable due to the integrated model based controller and the fault detection mechanisms Integrated fault-detection mechanisms have already shown that they provide a reliable operation of the ACS R EFERENCES   F W s off i cial aeros pace com pon e n t datas h eets  f o r  RW1, RW90, RW150, RW250, AGS and MFS  A S12006, Sm art G N  C C o m pon e n t s f or Sm art  Satellites - Anja Nicolai , Antje Deckert, Christian Raschke and Stephan Stoltz, AAS G&C Conference Feb 3-8, 2012 Breckenridge, Colorado 3 m art reactio n  w h eel s cap ab ilities a n d ad v a n t ag e s  Stoltz S., Raschke C., Courtois K., 1st International SPACE World Conference 2010, 2-4-November 2010 Frankfurt/Main, Germany \(2010  W  90, a s m art reaction w h eel \226 P r og res s f r o m B I R D to TET-1 - Stoltz S., Raschke C., Courtois K, 8 th IAA Symposium on small satellites for earth observation\224; 4-8 April 2011, Berlin Germany \(2011 5 d v a n ced Se n s o r s a n d  Actu ato r s f o r S m all Satelli tes  Roemer S., Raschke C., Stoltz S, 28 th International Symposium on Space Technology and Science, 5-10 June 2011, Okinawa Japan \(2011  m art G N  C  C o m pon e n t s 226 on g roun d an d i n o rbi t  Experiences from the TET-1 Satellite - Stoltz S., Raschke C., Deckert A., Nicolai A., 34 th IEEE Aerospace Conference, 2 \226 9 March 2013, Big Sky, Montana  B IOGRAPHY  Stephan Stoltz received his Diplom a in transportation aerospace\ engineering from Technical University of Berlin in 2007.

example of such a computation is PageRank. The MapReduceScatter primitive, mod eled after MPI ReduceScatter is aimed to support such use cases in an optimized manner Map-ReduceScatter gets rid of the inefficiency of simple broadcast ofing all the data to all the workers. Another alternative approach is to perform a join of loop i nvariant input data and loop variant data us ing an additional MapReduce step. However, this requires all th e data to be transported over the network from Map tasks to Reduce tasks, making the computation highly inefficient Map-ReduceScatter primitive is still a work in progress and we are planning on includi ng more information about it in our future publications X C ONCLUSIONS  We introduced Map-Collectives, collective communication operations for MapReduce in spired by MPI collectives as a set of high level primitiv es that encapsulate some of the common iterative MapReduce application patterns. MapCollectives improve the co mmunication and computation performance of the applications by enabling highly optimized group communication across th e workers, getting rid of unnecessary/redundant steps, and by enabling the frameworks to use a poly-algorithm approach based on the use case. MapCollectives also improve the usability of the MapReduce frameworks by providing abst ractions that closely resemble the natural application patterns. They also decrease the implementation burden on the developers by providing optimized substitutions for certain steps of the MapReduce model. We envision a future where many MapReduce and iterative MapReduce frameworks support a common set of portable Map-Collectives and consider this work as a step in that direction In this paper, we defined Map-AllGather and MapAllReduce Map-Collectives and implemented MultiDimensional Scaling and K-means Clustering applications using these operations. We also presented the H-Collectives library for Hadoop, which is a drop-in Map-Collectives library that can be used with existing MapReduce applications with only minimal modification. We also presented a MapCollectives implementation for Twister4Azure iterative MapReduce framework as well. MDS and K-means applications were used to evaluate the performance of MapCollectives on Hadoop and on Twister4Azure, depicting up to 33% and 50% speedups over the non-collectives implementations by getting rid of the communication and coordination overheads A CKNOWLEDGMENT  We would like to thank colleagues and members of the Digital Science Center at Indiana University for helpful discussions and contributions to Twister4Azure and the present work.

  Paper 2581 Version 2  11  These nine attribu tes have been used in this study to define a limited set of business models for civil use of UAS as a means of demonstrating the utility of business modeling Each of these attributes illustrates  a particular application or grouping of applications for use  of UAS.  Multiple current and near future applications are being considered, including    1  D elivery of cargo in remote areas 226  UAS offer efficiencies in terms of access, productivity timeliness, and potentially service quality   2  P olice operations 226  UAS use in DoD surveillance operations has created a market opportunity for similar use in civilian markets   3  Power line and pipeline inspection 226  Long distance detailed inspections requiring extensive hovering or repeated fly bys for inspection of worn components are well suited for execution with UAS   4  Agricultural use for management of crops and livestock 226  A UAS fitted with visual and IR sensors can fly over farm fields and locate pests weeds, and diseases, significantly improving the application of pesticides a t reduced loading to the crops and soil   5  Augmented flight assistance for manned flight 226  Business opportunities in this category range from transfer of technology from UAS experience to the cockpit to provide the pilot with a pilot\222s assistant to Optionall y Piloted Aircraft \(OPA\ where the aircraft is capable of human piloted and autonomous flight   and  6  Communications media relay 226  A UAS stays on station and provides the ability to connect users with a ground station for distribution of information to a lar ger customer base   Business model canvases have been created for each of the six applications cited above.  Fictitious companies were used; however, plausible circumstances, company relationships, and market opportunities were generated  to maximize relevance  Technology Transfer  The U.S. Government, especially through the D oD has made a significant investment to produce unmanned aircraft While less reliable than civilian certified manned aircraft these flying platforms are primaril y used to replace manned missions where risks are high or to provide an \223eye in the sky\224 extending the reconnaissance capabilities of the soldier on the ground. Long loiter times for sensors have proven their worth in battle areas. Patrol capabilities to s eek and detect threats have significantly improved both the vehicles and the sensors they carry  The market value is in the applications, not the aerial platform. The technology transfer that is needed is the adaptation of military technology for civilian  applications the freeing up of flight restrictions to stimulate application development, and the generation of revenue in the private sector through delivery of new ways of gathering information and converting that information for commercial use 227 whether  to reduce cost of existing activities or create new opportunities  Technology transfer can be divided into two major categories:  the transfer of aviation technology to manned flight, and the transfer of sensor technologies for adaptation in the civil mar ket  Aviation Technology 227 this is mainly  technology deployed in avionics  i.e systems that control flight, provide navigation, and support systems monitoring  Some examples of short term technology transfer opportunities include   Small autopilots that can be adapted for use in general aviation aircraft to improve performance and offer value added features at lower cost. The technology transfer is geared toward adapting autonomous flight opportunities from UASs to general aviation a ircraft   Sense and avoid technologies could aid general aviation safety, since most general aviation aircraft do not carry collision avoidance systems   Fuel and engine management systems used for optimizing loiter can be added to a Pilot Assistant for man ned aircraft  Autonomy must pass a major hurdle, that of attaining what the Air Force calls \223certifiable trust in autonomy.\224 The processes for certification are an area of joint collaboration between the military and civil sectors. New methods of Verifica tion and Validation \(V&V\ will be needed, and this V&V must be certifiably reliable, meaning there are scientific and engineering processes to prove performance  Sensor Technology 227 Electro optical video and IR, synthetic aperture radars, ground penetrating  radars, laser targeting systems make up the suite of current sensors. T he trend is to  produce the same or better performance with less system weight systems. This is coupled with the use of signal and information processing to improve the product sensing  for the operator. Approximately 80 percent of the commercial market will be realized in small UASs, where weight is a key factor. The vast majority of the users of the information the sensors capture will not be for a warfighter mission Therefore, inform ation presentation in usable forms will be essential to commercial success  Mapping technologies will need to be adapted to accept UAS derived information. The fight track, the sensor data and the underlying mapping must merge in order to realize the ben efits of sensor payloads on UAS. The technology transfer is a combination of information registry and visualization coupled with greater virtual reality

While the initial market will be in producing the flying pl atform and its sensors, the longer term market is in the information the sensors produce. When coupled with detailed mapping information through a geographical information system \(GIS new opportunities are created, from the farmer or rancher, to the larg e timber company, to water management authorities, to any case where a business involves land use  While most of the UAS industry is focused on a derivative of current military uses for security and police operations the civil industry is looking to use the UAS as a platform to produce revenue from the data derived through the sensors  Taking a longer view, the benefits are clear   Lower labor costs to accomplish tasks that are now performed by manned flight     Lower labor costs through a faster way to aut onomously gather information needed     Lower labor costs in land use field surveys and management    Greater use of information to manage application of water, fertilizers, pesticides, timing of crop harvests and management to produce greater yields \(from cor n to timber    Improvements in water management and allocation through use of GIS technologies paired with UAS sensor information    Reduced cost of environmental oversight and enforcement    Improved public safety through surveillance    Improved flight safety t hrough technology transfer from UAS to manned flight operations    Recognition of UAS flights as a data collection tool with the market driven by the information gained   Ease of operation to attain the data through information processing and presentation   The commercialization of UAS technology  and its capability to collect surveillance information  is limited by constraints imposed by the federal regulatory actions aviation\ and by general citizen concern over law enforcement applications of surveillance a nd the right to privacy. Both of these barriers will be overcome, but not without an impact on the economics of UAS. This delay will likely defer commercialization benefits and present additional obstacles to market entry  6  M ARKET B ARRIERS  Legal and Regulatory Policies and Procedures  The anticipated expansion of UAS into a myriad of public private, and commercial missions routinely using the national airspace alongside other air traffic has highlighted both the UAS operational needs and the public co ncerns associated with those operations. The Federal Aviation Authority\222s FAA's   Interim Operational Approval Guidance 08 01  gives the rules for gaining approval to operate UAS in the NAS and the operating limitations that are imposed on those flights. In  general, the rules for manned aircraft governing vehicle airworthiness, pilots maintenance, and use of the airspace have been directly applied to UAS operations with the caveat that relaxation of some of these rules may be granted if FAA accepts an opera tor proposed safety case using the regulatory process known as Alternate Methods of Compliance." Lacking that the UA S  must meet equivalent certification standards usually experimental category\, and be flown by a licensed pilot. Except in Class A airspa ce, UAS must be flown in VMC in sight of the pilot or, if a chase plane is used, in sight of the observer. UAS are to be maintained like a manned aircraft. All UAS flights in the NAS require a Certificate of Waiver or Authorization \(COA\, typically valid f or up to a year, obtained by submitting an application and receiving specific approval by the FAA  T he time and cost barriers these policies and procedures place in the way of achieving UAS benefits  are well documented Efforts are under way at FAA and th rough the RTCA Special Committee s  203  and 228  to create standards specifically for UAS of varying size and sophistication and for realistic operating procedures which would permit using their unique capabilities while still safeguarding the public Once in  place, these new standards will eliminate the time consuming COA process  Social Issues  Even when these technical and safety concerns are overcome, there is still a growing barrier to widespread use of UAS in the NAS brought on by the public's privacy con cerns. The most widely used mission for UAS is ISR, or more simply, surveillance. As many missions provide low altitude, high resolution surveillance, the privacy rights of citizens caught collaterally in the surveillance, must be protected  Articles in th e popular press have conjured up visions of thousands of prying eyes in the sky watching every move a person makes and continuously advising the authorities of individual's locations and activities. Even though a pro UAS bill was recently passed mandating the FAA to integrate UAS into the NAS by 2015   the government will also have to deal with the public's concern over privacy and the fears created by seeing numerous drones overhead, often at low altitude, regardless of how noble the purpose of their missio n  


  Paper 2581 Version 2  13  Environmental Impacts  Many proposed UAS missions identified earlier would place the vehicles in close proximity to persons who are not directly involved in the UAS operation. Civilian store deliver ies for example, could require a package drop off in cl ose vicinity to populated areas  The noise produced by the UAV being close to people could mean the difference between the success or failure of this type of business  Helicopters are notoriously loud noise producers Additionally, their blades are hazardous to be around. The wind produced by their hovering lift can also be strong enough to damage articles that are not either heavy or tied down. The fumes and gaseous e missions produced by the powerplants will be subject to the same environmental scrutiny  of all other transportation appliances and vehicles  Larger payloads and long endurance can be achieved quietly using lighter than air \(LTA\ or hybrid LTA vehicles with  multi mode propulsion capabilities. The lift required to keep large payloads aloft is not obtained aerodynamically, but through buoyancy, which is completely silent. This lift also produces no emissions, so if the thrust can be hybrid electric, most envir onmental concerns can be overcome.  A hybrid turbine electric propulsion system may also be capable of providing low noise periods of flight before and after which batteries are re charged.  The basic idea is that a battery powered ducted fan eliminates th e need for noisy gearboxes to operate during a noise sensitive leg of flight D Star Engineering is prototyping such a capability with funding from the I ntelligent Advanced research Projects Agency \(I ARPA   Other  There are other more subtle potential barri ers to acceptance of widespread use of UAS in the NAS Cost is still a significant factor for all but recreational radio controlled models. The costs of even experimental certification, pilot and mechanic training, salaries for pilots, mechanics, and other  mission specialists needed to carry out a drone mission, and the still relatively poor accident record for UAS, which can result in total loss of the expensive vehicles, are all substantial  Insurance costs for UAS operations over cities and towns are st ill being determined as actuarial data is slowly accumulated.  No matter how quiet or clean it is, the sight of a large vehicle passing overhead where none had been before may  draw complaints and political pressure to restrict or ban their operations  This  is not to suggest that these barriers cannot be overcome to the benefit of many domestic civil and military UAS missions. The concerns need to be understood and addressed so that their potential to stop the use of UAS is neutralized The technical barrier s are much simpler to overcome than the political and social ones, so continuous public education about the benefits of UAS use and the measures taken to ensure the safety and privacy of the general public is essential  7   UAS  F UTURE F ORECASTS  From resourc es reviewed during the study, the team developed the two forecasts: one for the military and public growth of  UAS  Figure 5  and one for the growth in civil use UAS  Figure 6  Under the FAA perspective   the definition of \223public\224 means federal agencies, s tate and local government organization \(including law enforcement and public universities These curves represent market 223demand\224 projections   Figure 5 2015 2035 Forecast for UAS DoD and Public  UAS   Figure 6 2015 2035 Forecast for Total Public and  Commercial UAS  8   C ONSTRAINTS AND I NFLUENCES ON UAS  T ECHNOLOGY  The technical team participating in the study  identified  listing of the top factors  that most likely will constrain UAS growth   These factors are  integrated functions drawn from the study areas when view ed as total system. The top six were determined to be of the most interest   Communication, Command and Control  needs to ensure pilot operators and air traffic controllers have clear, concise, and timely communications  


  Paper 2581 Version 2  14   Flight i nformation and processing   Presentation and projection of flight profiles   Real time operational information   Managing both pilot operator and air traffic controller workloads   Procedural processes supported by enhanced automation capabilities   Control sector complexity and management   Separation a ssurance   Airspace d esign and p rocedures   Investment in resolving these constraints  will drive the rate of adoption in civil UAS operations in the NAS One p art of the investment will be driven by the FAA\222s \223F acilities and Equipment\224 F&E Budget over  the next ten years Another part will be driven by defense and federal investment  in R&D  The remaining part will be driven by private investment seeking to develop profitable supplie r s and manufacturing firms of UAS Unfortunately   private investment will not fully launch until there is a clear indication of the public investment into implementing the requisite air traffic management  and air traffic control  ATM/ATC changes into the NAS infrastructure and there i s a common  approach through avionic standards in UA V  equipage   It is expected that avionic standards would lower the end user costs The impact on NAS infrastructure is the outline in the following subsection  Today\222s Air Traffic Control System  Today\222s air traffic control system is built around four basic pillars. These are communications, navigation, surveillance and infrastructure. The mortar holding these pillars together is aviation policy, rules and procedures  The FAA Air Traffic Organizat ion \(ATO\ has identified over 25 FAA procedural orders and notices that will need to be revised to accommodate routine  UAS operations in the NAS. This does not include advisory and informational materials that need to be developed and briefed to air traffi c controllers, pilots and other aviation stakeholders Additionally NAS investments to accommodate UAS efforts and associated costs must extend  beyond training requirements and procedural developments to include modification of infrastructure to permit an d to optimize efficiency and safety of UAS operations in the NAS  The majority of UAS operating in the NAS today are predominantly operated by the DoD. They were not designed with NAS compatibility in mind but rather to meet military mission needs. It is e xpected future commercial UAS will be designed and operated much more along the lines of manned aircraft. For example, current DoD UAS do not have Flight Management Systems and associated NAS aeronautical database and cannot be program m ed to fly approved F AA instrument procedures such as an instrument landing system \(ILS\ approach. Future commercial UAS operating in the NAS will need have integrated avionics systems and NAS capabilities similar to those of manned aircraft. However, unique challenges associa ted with UAS will remain and drive functional changes across many NAS project and programs. Some of these anticipated drivers or changes are listed by FAA program area below  En Route Automation Modernization \(ERAM 227 ERAM will be impacted by the need to be able to accept and process and display lengthy and complex UAS flight plans that include automated flight profile contingencies to the air traffic controller. This includes the ability to display a 20 minute planned route of flight on a controller\222s displa y suite  ERAM needs to be able to display to review to modify and to approve a UAS flight plan request originating in an en route center airspace environment as a 24 hour file and fly replacement to the current constrained  COA  process now is in use  Nati onal Voice System \(NVS  227 Future air traffic control voice switching systems must be able to provide timely and direct pilot to controller voice and data e.g text messaging\ communications via Voice Over Internet Protocol \(V o IP  Terminal Automation Mode rnization and Replacement TAMR  227 TAMR needs to be able to display to review to modify and to approve a UAS flight plan request originating in a terminal airspace environment as a 24 hour file and fly replacement to the current constrained COA  process now is use. TAMR also needs to be able to surveil approved UAS flights within the terminal environment  Terminal Information Display System \(IDS\ and En Route Information Display System \(ERIDS  227 Information support systems need to be able to inges t to and  to rapidly display unique local procedures and associated graphics associated with UAS operations. These include pilot communications and UAV control lost ink procedures  System Wide Information Management \(SWIM  227 SWIM  must be able to rapidly mov e critical UAS information around the NAS to provide the right information to the right controller or pilot at the right time and in the desired  format  Flight Information Exchange Model \(FIXM  227 UAS flight information needs to move to and from other Air Navigation Service Providers \(ANSP\ throughout the world and new data terminology must be created that supports the collection, processing and dissemination of UAS movements through the airspace  Air Traffic Control Optimum Training Solutions \(ATCOTS  227 UAS provides new training challenges for FAA in creating new teaching curricula that contains new procedures and paradigms used to accommodate UAS safely and efficiently in the NAS. This is notable c hallenge given 


  Paper 2581 Version 2  15  the diversity and dynamic of evolving UAS technologies and missions  Future Facilities 227 FAA real estate assets may likely be affected as new UAS related systems are development and deployed. UAS NAS integration may drive additional FAA manpow er needs for positions of operations, coordination and management. This may require additional physical footprints to accommodate new positions of operations personnel and their supporting infrastructure  Next Generation Weather Processor \(NWP\ and Weathe r and Radar Processor \(WARP  227 The removal of a pilot in the cockpit also removes the ability to \223see\224 from a traditional pilot\222s perspective. Not only does this relate to the need for electronic systems for detect and avoid \(i.e., the FAR reference 91.113 for see and avoid\ but also affects many aspects of flight safety associated with detection and avoidance of hazardous weather from visual perspective of the manned cockpit. Determination of flight visibility is one such factor. It should also be noted tha t many of the UAS flying in the NAS today have a very low tolerance to hazardous weather such as turbulence and icing  Detect and Avoid \(DAA  227  Depending upon architecture and functionality, detect and avoid for UAS could have a profound impact on a variety of FAA systems and infrastructure components. DAA can be airborne based, and affect Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast \(ADS B\ In and Out and an associated Cockpit Display of Traffic Information \(CDTI\nd Traffic Alert and Collision Avoida nce System \(TCAS\ functionality, including designs for the new Next Generation Airborne Collision Avoidance Systems \(ACAS X\. GBSAA that leverages ASR 11 Surveillance Radars and Standard Terminal Automation Replacement Systems \(STARS\ or TAMR also demands automation and surveillance system modification to provide this capability. Additional future work on portable primary three dimensional \(3D\ radars integrated in the NAS will also demand close analysis  The previous overview of FAA air traffic control sys tems gives insight in the investment required to be undertaken within the F AA\222s F&E  budget It also s erve s to illustrate the pervasiveness of changes that the UAS will eventually have on air traffic control and its supporting  ATM  infrastructure   It is impo rtant to recognize these ATM/ATC changes need to be planned for, funded and deployed. It must also be recognized that these UAS related investments do not stand alone in that these changes must be done while other planned ATC system improvements are taking  place I nvestments   such as   the Surveillance Broadcast System Program  National Voice Switch, Future Cyber Security Data Communications, and others are planned under the Next Generation Air Transport System  NextGen and others  Obviously   if future UA S forecasts are to be sustained it will entail a major shift in current FAA investment in addition to the  currently planned funding of NextGen  The forecasts outlined in this paper  will require an increase in funding levels of between $500 million and $1 billion dollars per year over and above current FAA requested F&E funding levels   Doing so will greatly facilitate realization of the $30 billion per year UAS market  9   S UMMARY  From an aviation perspective, UAS represents a new and disruptive technology  challenging the staid institutions policy, procedures and technologies that exist today and have served manned aircraft well for the last fifty years or more. This UAS technology supports an incredibly wide range of uses that not only allows old challeng es to be addressed in new ways but also creates new innovative world markets for hundreds, if not thousands, of new creative applications answering the call of \223better, faster and cheaper.\224  A growing number of early adopters and innovators of aviation tech nologies are beginning to realize the significance of a growing diversity and number of UAS  This growth  is  driven by a confluence of technological developments in airframes, powerplants, sensor s command and control sys tems and information management The  economic  value  of this industry projected to be $30 billion per year supporting 300,000 American jobs by 2035   As concluded b y the study team   the realization of UAS market forecasts will be constrained  unless key investment is performed in   The NAS ATC/A TM facilities needed to be updated to support new aircraft performance and controller capabilities   Training for ATC to be ready to adopt the new unmanned aircraft performance with acceptable workload    ATC to pilot communications that have the availability  integrity confidentiality and continuity as to not heavily impact either  pilot o r  controller workload   Development of Civil standards for the c ontrol and communications data link that w ill foster low cost access for a b road  range of UAS 226  this could in clude standards of f orm, fit and function as well as covering signal in space  networked channel  access and common control exchange applications    This key investment will develop a C 3  approach to support NAS integration.  It is agreed that other areas such as of DAA are important for investment, but there are already multiple economic incentive s  following this path
