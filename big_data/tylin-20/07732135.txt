Exploiting Apache Flink's Iteration Capabilities for Distributed Apriori: Community Detection Problem as an example Sanjay Rathee School of Computing and Electrical Engineering I.I.T., Mandi Himachal Pardesh, India E-Mail: sanjay_rathee@students.iitmandi.ac.in Arti Kashyap School of Computing and Electrical Engineering I.I.T., Mandi Himachal Pardesh, India E-Mail: arti@iitmandi.ac.in   Abstract Extraction of useful information from large datasets is one of the most important research problem Association rule mining is one of the best methods for this purpose. Finding possible associ ations between items in large transaction based datasets \(finding frequent patterns\ most important part of the association rule mining. There exists many algorithms to find frequent patterns but Apriori algorithm always remains a preferred choice due to its ease of implementation and natural tendency to be parallelized. Many single-machine based Apriori var iants exist but massive amount of data available these days is above capacity of a single machine Therefore, to meet the demands of this ever-growing huge data there is a need of mult iple machines based Apriori algorithm. For these type of distributed applications, mapreduce is a popular fault-tolerant  framework. Hadoop is one of the best open-source software framework with mapre duce approach for distributed storage and distributed processi ng of huge datasets using clusters built from commodity hardware. But heavy disk I/O operation at each iteration of a highly iterative algorithm like Apriori makes hadoop inefficient A number of map reduce ba sed platforms are being developed for parallel computing in recent years. Among them two platforms, namely, Spark and Flink have attracted lot of attention because of their inbuilt support to distributed computations. Earlier we had proposed a reduced- Apriori algorithm on Spark platform which outperforms parallel Apriori, firstly because of use of Spark and secondly because of the improvement we proposed in standard Apriori. Therefore present work is a natural sequel of our earlier work and targets on implementing, testing and benchmarking Apriori on Apache Flink and compares it with Spark implementation.   We conduct in-depth experiments to gain insight into the effectiveness efficiency and scalability of the Apriori algorithm on Flink. We also use community detection gr aph mining problem as a test case to demonstrate our implementations Keywords— Apriori; Apache Flink; Mapreduce; Spark Hadoop; R-Apriori; Frequent itemset mining I  I NTRODUCTION  Data mining techniques like clustering, classification association rule mining etc. are used to extract the useful information from large datasets. Association rule mining is one of the most important technique to mine useful information from large datasets. It is used to find interesting relations among various variables in large datasets. To create association rules, first we have to find frequent patterns in datasets, which makes frequent itemset mining the base process for association rule mining Association rule mining has many applications in various field of our life. Historically, it was used in market basket analysis to find relations between various products.  We can find products which are sold together frequently and these relations can be used to make a better business plans to arrange and sell the products Association rules can be very useful in graph mining techniques like community detection. Communities in a graph can be detected by finding most frequent paths occurring in a graph. A clique of required length will represent a community in graph and association rules techniques can find these cliques quite easily. Association rules can also be used for crime detection and prevention[21 We can a n alyze large  datasets of crime events happened in various cities or states and find out frequent patterns occurring in those events. These frequent patterns can be used to predict the most crime sensitive areas or persons involved in the most crimes. Cyber security is another importan t application of association rule mining  L a rge datasets havi ng i n f o rm ation about va rious attacks by various ports and IP addresses can be analyzed to find frequent addresses or ports which are most sensitive to attacks. This information can be used to block requests from these vulnerable addresses or ports In recent years, association rules are widely used for crowd mining[24  Crow d m i ning is a pr oc ess of extract ing information from a huge dataset which contains answers for various questions asked to the crowd. Based on the answers given by crowd for particular questions, we can find patterns in those answers and predict behavior of the crowd. This useful information can be used to make business strategies so that high benefits can be earned from the crowd available in that area For association rule mining various algorithms like Apriori, Éclat, FP-Growth are proposed. Most of the algorithms scan dataset to find out frequent patterns, which 2016 Intl.

can be used for rule generation. Apriori algorithm, firstly purposed by R. Agarwal et al  on a t h eorem that an itemset can be frequent only if its all nonempty subsets are also frequent. It uses an iterative approach where results of last iterations are used to find current iteration frequent itemset. It starts with finding singleton frequent items where an item occurring more than minimum support count is called frequent. Then K-frequent itemsets are found using K-1 frequent itemsets based on the Apriori approach. After finding singleton frequent items, candidate set is generated. Candidate set for K th iteration has all K size combination of items whose all subsets are frequent in K-1 iteration. To find K-frequent itemsets, we have to check only itemsets whose all subsets are present in K-1 frequent itemsets. Now these frequent itemsets of K iteration are used for generation of K+1 phase candidate set and it iterates until all the frequent patterns are found Apriori algorithm has some limitations, candidate set for 2 nd  phase is too huge if number of items is large and we have to scan dataset again and again for every iteration. An algorithm  was  pu r pose d to tackle this  pr obl em of m a ny sc ans  of datasets. Éclat algorithm uses horizontal approach. A new list is created where every row contains two columns, 1 st  column for item and 2 nd for all the transactions containing that item. Now singleton frequent items are found by counting number of transactions for that item in 2 nd column. After creating candidate set for K iteration, intersection of 2 nd  columns for all items in itemset can be used to find support of an itemset. Therefore, there is no requirement to scan dataset again and again for every iteration. There is only one scan of dataset in Eclat algorithm which ma kes it faster than Apriori algorithm, but still there is a limitation of huge candidate set for 2 nd phase if number of items are huge. To resolve huge candidate set problem FP-growth[8 algori thm was purpose d  by J. Han et al. In FP-Growth algorithm candidate generation step is removed. Initially singl eton frequent itemset are found and a FP-Tree is created. This FP-Tree is used to find out frequent patterns of all size. This algorithm is faster as compared to Apriori because it removes candidate generation step All the basic algorithms work on sequential approach and they were efficient until size of the dataset were small. As the size of datasets started increasing, their efficiency starts decreasing. Therefore to handle large datasets, parallel algorithms are introduc Many cluster-based algorithms were capable of handling large datasets but they were complex and have many issues like synchronization, replication of data etc. Therefore parallel approach is replaced by MapReduce approach. MapReduce approach makes association rule mining process very fast because algorithms like Apriori have possibilities of high parallelism. Key-value pairs can be easily generated in case of Apriori algorithm. Many Mapreduce based implementations of Apriori Algorithm[13, 12 were  proposed which shows a high performance gain as compared to the conventional Apriori algorithm. Hadoop[2 o n e of th e best platforms to implement Apriori algorithm as a Mapreduce model. But still there are so me limitations in Hadoop based implementation of Apriori algorithm. On Hadoop platform results are stored to HDFS after every iteration and input is taken from HDFS for next iteration, which decreases the performance due to input-output time. But Spar  platf o rm  tackle these problems by using its RDD architecture, which store results at the end of an iteration and provide them for next iteration. Apriori implementation on spark platform gives many times faster results on standard datasets which makes spark platform best for implem entation of Apriori algorithm to mine frequent patterns and generate association rules later Recently, Qiu ve re porte d 18 ti mes speedup on an average for various benchmarks for the yet another frequent itemset mining \(YAFIM\ algorithm based on Spark RDD framework. Their results with real world data for medical application is observed to be many times faster than MapReduce framework. Apache Spark also have a limitation that new iteration can be started only when all results of earlier iterations are produced. Apache F link tackles this problem by using pipelining architecture, that is, a new iteration can be started as soon as partial results are available. This pipelining architecture of apache Flink sparked interest in us to implement Apriori algorithm and our R-Apriori which already is faster than standard Apriori on Spark  for Flink  The paper is organized as fo llows. After introducing the subject and the motivation in Section I, earlier work about frequent itemset mining, mainly Apriori algorithm is reported in Section II. Section III introduces the Flink based Apriori algorithm in details. Section IV evaluate the performance of FApriori. Section V shows the use of Flink based Apriori algorithm for community detecti on and section VI concludes the paper II  E ARLIER W ORK  Apriori algorithm by R. Agarwal et al the m o s t  popular and effective algorith m for association rule mining based on a theorem that any itemset can be frequent only if all its non-empty subsets are frequent. This theorem reduces a lot of computation overhead to find frequent itemsets in transactional data. Many improved version of Apriori are proposed by many researchers. All these conventional and improved Apriori algorithms were capable of handling datasets of limited size. As the size of datas ets grows, these algorithms were not so efficient. Therefore, mapreduce based parallel implementations of Apriori were proposed to handle such huge datasets. A mapreduce based parallel implementation of Apriori algorithm \(MR-Apriori\wa s proposed by Ning Li et  y evaluated the size up, scale up and spee d up performance of parallel Apriori to prove that their algorithm can handle huge dataset efficiently. A new mapreduce based Apriori algorithm with better pruning technique, called IMRApriori,  is proposed by Za  They claimed that their algorithm is more time efficient than MRApriori algorithm due to better pruning technique. They use their algorithm to find freque nt itemsets from huge social network datasets. Another improved mapreduce based Apriori algorithm, c  some coding improvements over earlier mapreduce based algorithms. They found that their algorithm outperform conventional MR-Apriori algorithm for book recommendation service model. Many cloud computing and cluster based Apriori algorithms also proposed Ling juan Li et al. proposed an efficient and faster Apri ori implementation using cloud computing in 2011. All these mapreduce based Apriori 2016 Intl. Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics \(ICACCI 740 


implementation have nearly same speed and efficiency like MR-Apriori. All of these have a limitation of high I/O operations time because dataset is loaded from hadoop distributed file system \(HDFS\teration and then stored back to HDFS after completion of iteration. A mapreduce based implementation of Apriori algorithm on Spark platform\(YAFIM\jian Qiu et tackled the problem of high I/O operations time because Spark use RDD's to store results between various iterations of Apriori Therefore, YAFIM outperforms MR-Apriori algorithm by many times. Spark also have a limitation that next iteration cannot  be started until current iteration is completed. Apache  support iterative co mputations natively and Apriori is highly iterative algorithm. Ther efore, Flink's native support for iterative computation sparked an interest in us to test performance of  Apriori on flink and compare it with Spark implementation  Fig 1.  Apache Flink Iteration Suppo A  Apache Flink Apache flink is one of the best open source platforms for scalable batch, distributed and stream data processing. Its core is a streaming dataflow engine which provides data distribution, dist ributed computation, co mmunication and fault tolerance for distributed computa tions over large data streams Its pipelined architecture make it to support iterative computations natively. It supports iterative computations natively because 1\im e is well aware of iterative execution 2\no scheduling overhead between iterations 3\state maintenance and caching are handled automatically. Flink uses simple and delta iterations for iterative computations. Delta iteration\(Figure2\dup iterative computations many time faster as compared to classical iterative computing.\(Figure 1  Fig 2.  Apache Fli III  A PRIORI ON F LINK  Apriori uses an iterative approach where results of earlier iteration are used to find freque nt itemset for next iteration Apriori works on a theorem that an itemset can be frequent only if all its non-empty subsets are frequent. Therefore itemset frequent for current iterations are used to generate candidate set for next iterations. Candidate itemset are validated as frequent or infreque nt. Frequent itemset are those having occurrences more than minimum support. In next step these frequent itemsets are used to generate candidate set for next iteration. Same procedure is repeated until there is no frequent itemset found. Therefore, Apriori is called as highly iterative algorithm. Apache Flink support iterations natively and hence provides highly parallel environment for Apriori Flink implement Apriori in two phases. 1 st phase generates all singleton frequent items. 2 nd phase use iteration function of flink. It iterates until size of output\( frequent itemsets Every iteration generates frequent itemsets of length k. Both phases of Apriori are following   Figure3.

Figure 5 shows lineage graph for phase 2 of Apriori on Flink. Figure 6 shows processing model of Flink for Apriori algorithm IV  P ERFORMANCE E VALUATION  In this section, we present  performance evaluation of Apriori on Flink in comparison to other MR-Apriori implementations on Hadoop\(MR-Apriori   M o s t o f the  MapReduce implementation of Apriori on Hadoop nearly give the same performance as each of them reads data from HDFS and after each iteration write it back. In our experiments many benchmark datasets were used. All experiments were executed four times and average results were taken as final result. F-Apriori was implemented on Flink-0.9.1 and MRApriori was implemented on Hadoop-2.0. All datasets are available on same HDFS cluster.

 Fig 7.4  T25I10D10K Dataset min sup=10 V  A PRIORI ON F LINK  In this section we use Apriori implementation on Flink platform to solve the commun ity detection problem. Finding communities in graph is one of the most important problems in graph mining. Size of graphs is growing too fast these days that single machine algorithms are not capable to handle such huge graph datasets. For example,  Facebook has over one million users and still growing at an impressive rate Therefore, finding communities in graph with one million nodes is not efficient with a single machine algorithm. There is a need of highly parallel dist ributed computing algorithms to handle such huge graphs   A E D C G F B  Graph 1. Social media user graph  Fig 8. \(a\tional Dataset for Graph 1 \(b\ms with total count \(c\nt items after Phase1 We used Apace Flink to provide a highly parallel computing environment for mining graph dataset for community detection. Flink support graph and iterative computing natively so it will be best for algorithm like Apriori. Finding communities in huge graphs is one of most challenging problems in graph mining. A community can be detected by finding possible c liques of various length in given graph. Apriori is one of best algo rithms to find cliques in such huge graphs. To find a clique of length n, we have to find frequent patterns of length n with minimum support n. For example, we have to find communities in graph 1 given below. We can easily make a transactional dataset for a undirected graph like Graph 1 by using its matrix representation Figure 8\(a\hows the transactional dataset for Graph 1 Every node in graph is taken as transaction ID and node with all its adjacent nodes is itemset for that node  Fig 9. \(a\ pairs after iteration 2 \(b\r iteration 3 \(c\sult after iteration 4 Apriori takes this transactio nal data as input and produces results as shown in  Figure 8\(b\er combining all occurrences of every item.

iteration 3 and iteration 4 respectively. From results we can easily find out different possible cliques. An itemset of size 3 is frequent only if its all three nodes having an edge between them and an itemset of size 4 will be frequent if all four nodes have an edge between each other and so on. Therefore, max cliques possible for a set of nodes can be classified as a community. For example, graph 1 have 2 communities ABCD and EFG A large dataset of BMS web n al yzed by usi n g Flink based Apriori to find communities \(Figure 10 dataset contain many months click-stream data from two famous e-commerce web sites. Each transaction of these datasets is a web session consisting of all the products detail pages viewed in that particular session. Here every product page can be seen as a node of graph and a community will represent products pages which are traversed together. Flink based Apriori takes few minutes to analyze such a huge dataset with 77,532 transactions. The 2nd iteration is one of the most time and space consum ing iteration for distributed Apriori algorithm due to generation of a huge candidate set for singletone frequent items. For example, for 10 4 frequent singletons, it will generate nearly 10 8 candidate pairs. To map such a huge number of candidate pairs for every transaction is very time consuming. To gain further insite, it will be interesting to explore more datasets  VI  C ONCLUSION  A Flink based distributed Apriori is implemented to mine frequent patterns from huge graphs and large datasets. It uses basic Apriori theorem that an itemset is frequent only if all its non-empty sunset are frequent It is implemented on Apache Flink platform which provides it highly parallel and distributed computing environmen t. Flink is best suited for Apriori because Apache Flink ha ve native support for iterative computation and Apriori is iterative algorithm. Flink's pipelined architecture allow us to start a new iteration of Apriori as soon as partial results of earlier iteration are present. Delta iteration functionality of Flink makes Apriori highly parallel and effective algorithm for huge datasets Apriori is used to find co mmunities in huge graphs. In Summary, we have presented an implementation of Apriori on Flink and tested it with different datasets. We showed that Flink based Apriori is capable of handling huge graphs and large transactional datasets easily R EFERENCES  1  Anna L. Buczak and Christopher M.

    Fig. 8. Comparative Analysis Classification Algorithms V  CONCLUSION Associative Classification techniques are used to make better decision in critical situations. The proposed associative classification called as Classification of microarray gene expression data using associative classification and gene expression intervals used to clas sify the gene expression with gene intervals in affected gene expression. The experimental results are carried out by using the gene expression of breast cancer. The associative classification on gene expression data obtained the best prediction and accuracy of the classification result. The proposed algorithm was tested with two class and multi class data sets. The classification algorithm was compared with the classical classification algorithms such as Linear Discriminant Analysis, SVM, and Decision Tree. After the comparison of traditional classification algorithms, as per the view of possible error rates the Associative Classification algorithm is best for biological data. The results of this work are used to drug designer for cancer diseases. The proposed algorithm works on gene expression data.

on items contained in each item group When the number of pivots increases the entire database is split into a ner granularity and the number of partitions increase correspondingly Such a ne granularity leads to a reduction in distance computation among transactions On the other hand when the pivot number k continues growing the number of transactions mapped into one hash bucket signiÞcantly increases thereby leading to a large candidate-object set and high shufßing cost see Figs 3b and 3c Consequently the overall execution time is optimized when k is 60 for both algorithms see Fig 3a 6.2 Minimum Support Recall that minimum support plays an important role in mining frequent itemsets We increase minimum support thresholds from 0.0005 to 0.0025 percent with an increment of 0.0005 percent to evaluate the impact of minimum support on FiDoop-DP The other parameters are the same as those for the previous experiments Fig 4a shows that the execution times of FiDoop-DP and Pfp decrease when the minimum support is increasing Intuitively a small minimum support leads to an increasing number of frequent 1-itemsets and transactions which have to be scanned and transmitted Table 2 illustrates the size of frequent 1-itemsets stored in FList and the number of nal output records of the two parallel solutions under various minimum-support values Fig 4a reveals that regardless of the minimum-support value FiDoop-DP is superior to Pfp in terms of running time Two reasons make this performance trend expected First FiDoop-DP optimizes the partitioning process by placing transactions with a high similarity into one group rather than randomly and evenly grouping the transaction Fig 4b conÞrms that FiDoop-DPÕs shufßing cost is signiÞcantly lower than that of Pfp thanks to optimal data partitions offered by FiDoop-DP Second this grouping strategy in FiDoop-DP minimizes the number of transactions for each GList under the premise of data completeness which leads to reducing mining load for each Reducer The grouping strategy of FiDoop-DP introduces computing overhead including signature-matrix calculation and hashing each band into a bucket Nevertheless such small overhead is offset by the performance gains in the shufßing and reduce phases Fig 4a also shows that the performance improvement of FiDoop-DP over Pfp is widened when the minimum support increases This performance gap between FiDoop-DP and Pfp is reasonable because pushing minimum support up in FiDoop-DP lters out an increased number of frequent 1-itemsets which in turn shortens the transaction partitioning cost Small transactions simplify the correlation analysis among the transactions thus small transactions are less likely to have a large number of duplications in their partitions As a result the number of duplicated transactions to be transmitted among the partitions is signiÞcantly reduced which allows FiDoop-DP to deliver better performance than Pfp 6.3 Data Characteristic In this group of experiments we respectively evaluate the impact of dimensionality and data correlation on the performance of FiDoop-DP and Pfp by changing the parameters in the process of generating the datasets using the IBM Quest Market-Basket Synthetic Data Generator 6.3.1 Dimensionality The average transaction length directly determines the dimensions of a test data We conÞgure the average transaction length to 10 40 60 and 85 to generate T10I4D 130 blocks T40I10D 128 blocks T60I10D 135 blocks T85I10D 133 blocks datasets respectively In this experiment we measure the impacts of dimensions on the performance of FiDoop-DP and Pfp on the 8-node Hadoop cluster The experimental results plotted in Fig 5a clearly indicate that an increasing number of dimensions signiÞcantly raises the running times of FiDoop-DP and Pfp This is because increasing the number of dimensions increases the number of groups thus the amount of data transmission sharply goes up as seen in Fig 5b The performance improvements of FiDoop-DP over Pfp is diminishing when the dimensionality increases from 10 to 85 For example FiDoop-DP offers an improvement of 29.4 percent when the dimensionality is set to 10 the improvement drops to 5.2 percent when the number of dimensions becomes 85 In what follows we argue that FiDoop-DP is inherently losing the power of reducing the number of redundant transactions in high-dimensional data When a dataset has a low dimensionality FiDoop-DP tends to build partitions Fig 4 Impact of minimum support on FiDoop-DP and Pfp TABLE 2 The Size of FList and the Number of Final Output Records Under Various Minimum-Support Values minsupport 0.0005 0.001 0.0015 0.002 0.0025 FList 14.69k 11.6k 9.71k 6.89k 5.51k OutRecords 745 588 465 348 278 XUN ET AL FIDOOP-DP DATA PARTITIONING IN FREQUENT ITEMSET MINING ON HADOOP CLUSTERS 109 


each of which has distinct characteristics compared with the other partitions Such distinct features among the partitions allow FiDoop-DP to efÞciently reduce the number of redundant transactions In contrast a dataset with high dimensionality has a long average transaction length therefore data partitions produced by FiDoop-DP have no distinct discrepancy Redundant transactions are likely to be formed for partitions that lack distinct characteristics Consequently the beneÞt offered by FiDoop-DP for highdimensional datasets becomes insigniÞcant 6.3.2 Data Correlation We set the correlation among transactions i.e corr to 0.15 0.25 0.35 0.45 0.55 0.65 and 0.75 to measure the impacts of data correlation on the performance of the two algorithms on the 8-node Hadoop cluster The Number of Pivots is set to 60 see also Section 6.1 The experimental results plotted in Fig 5c clearly indicate that FiDoop-DP is more sensitive to data correlation than Pfp This performance trend motivates us to investigate the correlation-related data partition strategy Pfp conducts default data partition based on equal-size item group without taking into account the characteristics of the datasets However FiDoop-DP judiciously groups items with high correlation into one group and clustering similar transactions together In this way the number of redundant transactions kept on multiple nodes is substantially reduced Consequently FiDoop-DP is conducive to cutting back both data transmission trafÞc and computing load As can be seen from Fig 5c there is an optimum balance point for data correlation degree to tune FiDoop-DP performance e.g 0.35 in Fig 5c If data correlation is too small Fidoop-DP will degenerate into random partition schema On the contrary it is difÞcult to divide items into relatively independent groups when data correlation is high meaning that an excessive number of duplicated transactions have to be transferred to multiple nodes Thus a high data correlation leads to redundant transactions formed for partitions thereby increasing network and computing loads 6.4 Speedup Now we are positioned to evaluate the speedup performance of FiDoop-DP and Pfp by increasing the number of data nodes in our Hadoop cluster from 4 to 24 The T40I10D 128 blocks dataset is applied to drive the speedup analysis of the these algorithms Fig 6 reveals the speedups of FiDoop-DP a nd Pfp as a function of the number of data nodes The experimental results illustrated in Fig 6a show that the speedups of FiDoop-DP and Pfp linearly scale up with the increasing number of data nodes Such a speedup trend can be attributed to the fact that increasing the number of data nodes under a xed input data size inevitably 1 reduces the amount of itemsets being handled by each node and 2 increases communication overhead among mappers and reducers Fig 6a shows that FiDoop-DP is better than Pfp in terms of the speedup efÞciency For instance the FiDoop-DP improves the speedup efÞciency of Pfp by up to 11.2 percent with an average of 6.1 percent This trend suggests FiDoopDP improves the speedup efÞciency of Pfp in large-scale The speedup efÞciencies drop when the Hadoop cluster scales up For example the speedup efÞciencies of FiDoopDP and Pfp on the 4-node cluster are 0.970 and 0.995 respectively These two speedup efÞciencies become 0.746 and 0.800 on the 24-node cluster Such a speedup-efÞciency trend is driven by the cost of shufßing intermediate results which sharply goes up when the number of data nodes scales up Although the overall computing capacity is improved by increasing the number of nodes the cost of synchronization and communication among data nodes tends to offset the gain in computing capacity For example the results plotted in Fig 6b conÞrm that the shufßing cost Fig 5 Impacts of data characteristics on FiDoop-DP and Pfp Fig 6 The speedup performance and shufßing cost of FiDoop-DP and Pfp 110 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS VOL 28 NO 1 JANUARY 2017 


is linearly increasing when computing nodes are scaled from 4 to 24 Furthermore the shufßing cost of Pfp is larger than that of FiDoop-DP 6.5 Scalability In this group of experiments we evaluate the scalability of FiDoop-DP and Pfp when the size of input dataset dramatically grows Fig 7 shows the running times of the algorithms when we scale up the size of the T40I10D data series Figs 7a and 7b demonstrate the performance of FiDoop-DP processing various datasets on 8-node and 24-node clusters respectively Fig 7 clearly reveals that the overall execution times of FiDoop-DP and Pfp go up when the input data size is sharply enlarged The parallel mining process is slowed down by the excessive data amount that has to be scanned twice The increased dataset size leads to long scanning time Interestingly FiDoop-DP exhibits a better scalability than Pfp Recall that see also from Algorithm 1 the second MapReduce job compresses an initial transaction database into a signature matrix which is dealt by the subsequent process The compress ratio is high when the input data size is large thereby shortening the subsequent processing time Furthermore Fidoop-DP lowers the network trafÞc induced by the random grouping strategy in Pfp In summary the scalability of FiDoop-DP is higher than that of Pfp when it comes to parallel mining of an enormous amount of data 7R ELATED W ORK 7.1 Data Partitioning in MapReduce Partitioning in databases has been widely studied for both single system servers e.g and distributed storage systems e.g BigTable PNUTS[31 The existing approaches typically produce possible ranges or hash partitions which are then evaluated using heuristics and cost models These schemes offer limited support for OLTP workloads or query analysis in the context of the popular MapReduce programming model In this study we focus on the data partitioning issue in MapReduce High scalability is one of the most important design goals for MapReduce applications Unfortunately the partitioning techniques in existing MapReduce platforms e.g Hadoop are in their infancy leading to serious performance problems Recently a handful of data partitioning schemes have been proposed in the MapReduce platforms Xie et al  developed a data placement management mechanism for heterogeneous Hadoop clusters Their mechanism partitions data fragments to nodes in accordance to the nodes processing speed measured by computing ratios In addition Xie et al  designed a data redistribution algorithm in HDFS to address the data-skew issue imposed by dynamic data insertions and deletions CoHadoop is a H a d oop s lightweight extension which is designed to identify relateddataÞlesfollowedbyamodiÞeddataplacement policy to co-locate copies of those related les in the same server CoHadoop considers the relevance among les that is CoHadoop is an optimization of HaDoop for multiple les A key assumption of the MapReduce programming model is that mappers are completely independent of one another Vernica et al  broke such an assumption by introducing an asynchronous communication channel among mappers T his c hannel e nables the m appers to see global states managed in metadata Such situationaware mappers SAMs can enable MapReduce to exibly partition the inputs Apart from this adaptive sampling and partitioning were proposed to produce balanced partitions for the reducers by sampling mapper outputs and making use of obtained statistics Graph and hypergraph partitioning have been used to guide data partitioning in parallel computing Graph-based partitioning schemes capture data relationships For example Ke et al applied a graphic-execution-plan graph EPG to perform cost estimation and optimization by analyzing various properties of both data and computation Their estimation module coupled with the cost model estimate the runtime cost of each vertex in an EPG which represents the overall runtime cost a data partitioning plan is determined by a cost optimization module Liroz-Gistau et al proposed the MR-Part technique which partitions all input tuples producing the same intermediate key co-located in the same chunk Such a partitioning approach minimizes data transmission among mappers and reducers in the shufße phase The approach captures the relationships between input tuples and intermediate keys by monitoring the execution of representative workload Then based on these relationships their approach applies a min-cut k-way graph partitioning algorithm thereby partitioning and assigning the tuples to appropriate fragments by modeling the workload with a hyper graph In doing so subsequent MapReduce jobs take full advantage of data locality in the reduce phase Their partitioning strategy suffers from adverse initialization overhead Fig 7 The scalability of FiDoop-DP and Pfp when the size of input dataset increases XUN ET AL FIDOOP-DP DATA PARTITIONING IN FREQUENT ITEMSET MINING ON HADOOP CLUSTERS 111 


7.2 Application-Aware Data Partitioning Various efÞcient data partitioning strategies have been proposed to improve the performance of parallel computing systems For example Kirsten et al  developed two general partitioning strategies for generating entity match tasks to avoid memory bottlenecks and load imbalances Taking into account the characteristics of input data Aridhi et al proposed a novel density-based data partitioning technique for approximate large-scale frequent subgraph mining to balance computational load among a collection of machines Kotoulas et al built a data distribution mechanism based on clustering in elastic regions Traditional term-based partitioning has limited scalability due to the existence of very skewed frequency distributions among terms Load-balanced distributed clustering across networks and local clustering are introduced to improve the chance that triples with a same key are collocated These selforganizing approaches need no data analysis or upfront parameter adjustments in a priori Lu et al studied k nearest neighbor join using MapReduce in which a data partitioning approach was designed to reduce both shufßing and computational costs In LuÕs study objects are divided into partitions using a Voronoi diagram with carefully selected pivots Then data partitions i.e Voronoi cells are clustered into groups only if distances between them are restricted by a speciÞc bound In this way their approach can answer the k-nearest-neighbour join queries by simply checking object pairs within each group FIM for data-intensive applications over computing clusters has received a growing attention efÞcient data partitioning strategies have been proposed to improve the performance of parallel FIM algorithms A MapReducebased Apriori algorithm is designed to incorporate a new dynamic partitioning and distributing data method to improve mining performance This method divides input data into relatively small splits to provide exibility for improved load-balance performance Moreover the master node doesnÕt distribute all the data once rather the rest data are distributed based on dynamically changing workload and computing capability weight of each node Similarly Jumbo adopted a dynamic partition assignment technology enabling each task to process more than one partition Thus these partitions can be dynamically reassigned to different tasks to improve the load balancing performance of Pfp Uthayopas et al  investigated I/O and execution scheduling strategies to balance data processing load thereby enhancing the utilization of a multi-core cluster system supporting association-rule mining In order to pick a winning strategy in terms of data-blocks assignment Uthayopas et al incorporated three basic placement policies namely the round robin range and random placement Their approach ignores data characteristics during the course of mining association rules 8F URTHER D ISCUSSIONS In this study we investigated the data partitioning issues in parallel FIM We focused on MapReduce-based parallel FPtree algorithms in particular we studied how to partition and distribute a large dataset across data nodes of a Hadoop cluster to reduce network and computing loads We argue that the general idea of FiDoop-DP proposed in this study can be extended to other FIM algorithms like Apriori running on Hadoop clusters Apriori-based parallel FIM algorithms can be classiÞed into two camps namely count distribution and data distribution  For the count distribution camp each node in a cluster calculates local support counts of all candidate itemsets Then the global support counts of the candidates are computed by exchanging the local support counts For the data distribution camp each node only keeps the support counts of a subset of all candidates Each node is responsible for delivering its local database partition to all the other processors to compute support counts In general the data distribution schemes have higher communication overhead than the count distribution ones whereas the data distribution schemes have lower synchronization overhead than its competitor Regardless of the count distribution or data distribution approaches the communication and synchronization cost induce adverse impacts on the performance of parallel mining algorithms The basic idea of Fidoop-DPÑgrouping highly relevant transactions into a partition allows the parallel algorithms to exploit correlations among transactions in database to cut communication and synchronization overhead among Hadoop nodes 9C ONCLUSIONS A ND F UTURE W ORK To mitigate high communication and reduce computing cost in MapReduce-based FIM algorithms we developed FiDoop-DP which exploits correlation among transactions to partition a large dataset across data nodes in a Hadoop cluster FiDoop-DP is able to 1 partition transactions with high similarity together and 2 group highly correlated frequent items into a list One of the salient features of FiDoopDP lies in its capability of lowering network trafÞc and computing load through reducing the number of redundant transactions which are transmitted among Hadoop nodes FiDoop-DP applies the Voronoi diagram-based data partitioning technique to accomplish data partition in which LSH is incorporated to offer an analysis of correlation among transactions At the heart of FiDoop-DP is the second MapReduce job which 1 partitions a large database to form a complete dataset for item groups and 2 conducts FP-Growth processing in parallel on local partitions to generate all frequent patterns Our experimental results reveal that FiDoop-DP signiÞcantly improves the FIM performance of the existing Pfp solution by up to 31 percent with an average of 18 percent We introduced in this study a similarity metric to facilitate data-aware partitioning As a future research direction we will apply this metric to investigate advanced loadbalancing strategies on a heterogeneous Hadoop cluster In one of our earlier studies see for details we addressed the data-placement issue in heterogeneous Hadoop clusters where data are placed across nodes in a way that each node has a balanced data processing load Our data placement scheme can balance the amount of data stored in heterogeneous nodes to achieve improved data-processing performance Such a scheme implemented at the level of Hadoop distributed le system HDFS is unaware of correlations among application data To further improve load balancing 112 IEEE
