A Visualization Primitive for Multiway Relationships SeungJin Lim Computer Science Merrimack College North Andover MA 01845 lims@merrimack.edu Abstract 227With the unprecedented wave of Big Data the importance of information visualization is catching greater momentum Understanding the underlying relationships between constituent entities is a common task in every branch of science and visualization of such relationships is a critical part of data analysis While the techniques for the visualization of binary relationships are widespread visualization techniques for ternary or higher relationships are lacking In this paper we propose a visualization primitive which is suitable for multiway relationships Its effectiveness is demonstrated in 3-D visualization Keywords multiway relationship visualization frequent itemset I I NTRODUCTION Augustus De Morgan said 223When two objects qualities classes or attributes viewed together by the mind are seen under some connexion that connexion is called a relation.\224 Scienti\002c activities in any 002eld involve the identi\002cation of subject matters or entities and the relationships between them When the relationships of the constituent entities are understood the mysteries of the pertaining system are unfolded to our comprehension For example the universal law of gravity tells how two point entities attract each other with a force Likewise all the mathematical formulas in science are expressions of relationships among the constituent entities It is critical to understand these relationships to understand the full drama played by the entities Among the various degrees of relationships in terms of arity the binary relationship is the most common Binary relationships depict the relationship between two entities only and numerous applications are found in many branches in science Examples include the gravitation between two masses in physics symbiotic organisms in biology cocitation and co-authorship in bibliographic coupling studies spatial co-location in spatial data mining frequent 2-itemsets in association mining and friend relationship in social networks At the same time we recognize the rise of the signi\002cance of multiway relationships where three or more entities are related simultaneously For example the authors of  identi\002ed tw o types of friendship from their study on Facebook One type is the sympathy group which consist of approximately 15 close friends The other type is the Figure 1 Collaborative authors in scienti\002c publication support clique of 223friends on whom you would depend for emotional/social support in times of crisis.\224 The size of the second group is approximately 5 When all the individuals in a support clique have mutual dependency one another we say that the relationship is multiway and it may give critical information in a sociology or psychology study Entity relationships are commonly represented in a textual format using a data structure designed for the data A classic example is a tuple notation which is widely used in the relational database model Relationships are also represented graphically Edges between vertices in a graph G  050 V E 051 is a classical example of this kind of representation which has a dominant appearance in data/information visualization such as in social network analysis web graph and so forth The visualization of a binary relationship is conveniently and effectively done by drawing a line between the two related objects In Figure 1 the binary coauthorship relationship between G Barkerma and N Moursseau is apparent A drawback of this visualization is that the readers are prone to mistakingly derive the ternary relationship 050Barkerma Leeuw Moursseau\051 from 050Barkerma Leeuw\051 050Barkerma Moursseau\051 and 050Leeuw Moursseau\051 In this paper we propose a geometric primitive which is suitable for visualizing ternary or higher arity relationships in 3-D A set of design goals are also discussed The effectiveness of the proposed primitive is demonstrated with various real-world datasets as well as arti\002cial datasets The remainder of this paper is organized as follows In Section II some selected related works are presented We present a detailed discussion of the proposed visualization

primitive with design goals in Section III We conclude our presentation with a future plan in Section IV II R ELATED W ORKS The topic of our work is generally related to scienti\002c visualization in which a global summary of data is often the primary interest On the other hand local details are also important in visual data exploration and mining to which our work is closely related A review on visual data exploration and mining can be found in Undirected relationships between entities are largely visualized as 2-D or 3-D matrices  9 or undirected graphs 7 3 A number of dif ferent approaches exist and they are conveniently categorized with respect to the layout of entities and visual cues representing relationships Difference in layout Two types of entity layouts are commonly found in the literature and in practice 1\051  Single set of entities Only one set of entities is used in the visualization The entities may be arranged along the circumference of a circle 050Figure 2a\051 on a single linear axis 050Figure 2b\051 or anywhere in the given plane 050Figure 2c\051 to carry the same information 2\051  Two sets of entities This layout can be thought of as a matrix where one axis carries the full set of entities and another axis perpendicular to the other axis carries the same set of entities in the same ordering This layout is extended often to capture the correlation between two variables The layout may also be extended to a 3-D space to amplify the visual effect of the signi\002cance of relationships Difference in the representation of relationships 1\051  Presence or absence of relationship When the presence or absence of a relationship between two entities is what matters connecting the two entities by an edge or a marker on a 2-D plot is suf\002cient The three visualizations in Figure 2 and scatter plot-like visualizations belong to this category 2\051  Signi\002cance of relationship In contrast Figure 1 shows the signi\002cance of a relationship using another visual cue such as thickness of edges color or density of color or height of object in a 3-D space As for the visualization techniques designed speci\002cally for data mining the authors of chose to sho w cluster analysis results in a 3-D matrix such that the square grid of horizontal axes represent data objects and the vertical axis represents the similarity between the two corresponding objects Visualization of geospatial point sets presented in  is inherently a similar 3-D matrix visualization since longitude and latitude values constitute X and Y axes We notice that these visualization techniques discussed above are designed for binary relationships and we are not aware of a technique suitable for multiway relationships at the time of this writing III V ISUALIZATION OF M ULTIWAY R ELATIONSHIPS We now present a discussion on our strategy for the visualization of multiway relationships The heart of the visualization of n ary relationships is to design a visualization primitive which is suitable for n ary relationships The primitive should not only be capable of rendering n ary relationships accurately but also guarantee that the rendering is exclusively for n ary only preventing it from being interpreted as any arity other than n  A Multiway Relationships as Hyperedges In developing an effective 3-D metaphor for n ary relationships where n is a reasonably large integer value we investigated several geometric shapes as options In particular we have considered three approaches to hyperedge 050a\051 A ternary and a 4-ary relationships with edges only 050b\051 A ternary and a 4-ary relationships with edges and a covering surface Figure 3 Two hyperedge techniques for n ary relationships The 002rst approach is simply connecting the constituent entities to the center of the entities with n lines for n ary relationships An example of this approach is shown in Figure 3a This approach is computationally ef\002cient Also each hyperedge is thin and occupies less pixels on the screen than the other approaches Hence it offers more visual information on the screen than the others However it presents a challenge to identify the correct connecting center of a relationship When there are many relationships and the degrees of the relationships are diverse the problem is augmented The next approach is to add a geometric surface to the hyperdge at the expense of incurring more computation and leaving less visual information space In Figure 3b we add to the edges a polygon which has k sides for k ary tuples The advantage of this approach is that multiway relations can be identi\002ed quicker and easier with the aid of the polygon surface and that it is relatively easy to implement However it has a considerable drawback each hyperedge occupies a much larger area than the previous edge-only approach leaving less amount of unoccupied pixels on the screen Hypothetically when the degree of a relationship is close to the maximum arity it is possible that the single hyperedge would block nearly the entire visualization space

050a\051 Circular layout 050b\051 Kandinski layout 050c\051 Podevsef layout Figure 2 Various approaches to visualization of relationships using a single set of entities 050although such high-degree relationships are not common in real-world datasets\051 Between these two approaches we take the second approach with a modi\002cation mainly because of its strength to distinguish relationships and their arities The improvement that we made to the second hyperedge approach is two-fold we use concave sides for the polygon surface to reduce the amount of pixels to use and spherical edges are used that the proposed visualization primitive may be used in a 3-D visualization as well For an example of 3 ary hyperedge we can employ a hyperbolic triangle that can be found in hyperbolic geometry The characteristics of a hyperbolic triangles are well studied in a 2-D space However extending the theory of hyperbolic triangles to a higher dimensional geometric shape for the purpose of implementation requires substantially more effort The novelty of our work in implementing spherical edges and accompanying concave-sided polygon surfaces is to use Bezier curves as discussed below B Geometry of hyperedges As discussed earlier the proposed hyperedge primitive has edges 050we call them 223legs\224\051 and a cover in our 3-D metaphor A n ary hyperedge has n legs plus a 3-D surface covering the midpoint of the legs to make it easier to identify the arity of the underlying relationship and to augment the 3D look of the hyperedge In designing and implementing such hyperedges we ought to maximize the separation of hyperedges from each other for effective data analysis We begin with the construction of legs Each n ary relationship is 002rst mapped to a n ary hyperedge of n legs each of which is a quadratic Bezier curve standing vertically A quadratic Bezier curve requires three control points to de\002ne Given three control points p 0  p 1 and p 2  the quadratic Bezier curve is de\002ned as a function of t 2  B 050 t 051  0501 000 t 051 2 001 p 0  2 t 0501 000 t 051 001 p 1  t 2 001 p 2 where t denotes a curve segment Let I be a n ary relationship whose constituent n entities i 1      i n  are located on the circumference of a circle and let p m be the middle point of the n objects representing the n entities on the x z plane Then we can construct the hyperedge for the n ary relationship as follows First take i 1 as p 0 of the corresponding quadratic Bezier curve We can compute the location of p 2 such that p 2 is the opposite point of p 0 on the circle about p m  Furthermore set the y axis value 050i.e the height\051 of p m to the statistical signi\002cance value of I  Now we can create a quadratic Bezier curve using the three control points p 0  p m and p 2  Take the half of the curve on the p 0 side as the component curve for i 1  Repeat the steps to construct component Bezier curves for the other entities The resulting n Bezier curves are joined at the peak point to yield a parabolic-shaped hyperedge whose height is scaled by the statistical signi\002cance of the corresponding n ary relationship automatically The hyperedge is further decorated with a concave-sided polygon cover over the peak point for visual clarity Figure 4a shows examples of hyperedges for 3to 7-ary relationships Hyperedges for 3 tuples are constructed from three Bezier curves with a cover at the joining point of each hyperedge as shown in the 002gure The 002gure also illustrates that relationships of higher arity can also be constructed seamlessly using the same algorithm Notice that each side of the polygon cover of a hyperedge is also a Bezier curve the exact shape of which is determined by the locations of the control points The length of the uncovered portion of a leg by the corresponding cover is about 50 of the leg length 050measured from the bottom to the peak\051 in average We found that this parameter yields good visual feedback while not dominantly covering other hyperedges when its value is about 80 C Visual cues Visualization of relationships of arbitrary arities would be challenging mainly due to the fact that the arity of relationships can vary widely and the number of relationships that are dealt in data warehouses or in big data can be very large Also users may respond to the visual stimuli coming from a large number of visual primitives differently Visualization of relationships using multiple visual cues is generally more effective than using a single visual cue as long as they are used with consistency In the proposed visualization primitive for n ary relationships multiple visual cues are used to maximize the discriminative power of the metaphors shape color illumination height and thickness

Recent techniques are focused on mining top K CFIs where user need not have mention minimum support but need to specify the K value. From our previous work on mining approximate frequent itemsets from data streams [2 w e  have observed that specifying an optimum minimum support threshold is not possible for an uncertain data stream. For lower minimum support threshold, we will find a very large number of frequent itemsets for dense data but none or very small number for sparse data. So either the algorithm should mine all CFIs or shall learn the value of minimum support threshold value from the data itself based density and drifting concepts Due to limited memory in the computational systems algorithms have been continuously improved for better memory utilization. Different data structures like tree, lattice, table form etc have been proposed. Since tree and lattice format compresses the original database to a large extent, traversing it is complex and time consuming. So hybrid method of using tree or lattice along with table format is preferred. The algorithm shall not require the complete list of CFIs to be in the memory for searching. Instead should adopt techniques to merge itemsets with acceptable approximation and develop an compact structure to quickly identify CFIs from latest transactions from data streams reducing the memory footprint and processing time To make the algorithms faster and memory efficient approximation, minimum length, maximum length of itemsets etc have been used to prune infrequent and uninterested itemsets. If the dimensionality of the data is uncertain then it will be difficult to specify the minimum and maximum length of the interested itemsets. The error introduced due to approximation will not be constant for all the itemsets for both dense and sparse data. The error will be more for less frequent sparse data bur less for frequent and dense data. So there is a need for an algorithm to use approximation with less error or specified acceptable error with uniform error distribution Big data has gained lot of focus in the recent years. Due to the wide use of internet enabled smart portable devices, increased deployment of Internet-of-Things \(IoT\etc has pushed several applications to process the high speed data stream in faster and distributed manner. Since big data analytics and distributed computing has gained focus from recent years, the algorithm for mining CFIs on high speed data from parallel different source shall be developed using distributed computing techniques. This also complicates the data structure used to store CFIs as it also needs to be distributed Last but not the least, the distributed data structure used to store CFIs from big data stream shall be queried in real-time. A distributed query processing framework shall be developed which can process user queries and return the result in real-time V 002 002 threshold are 002 002 002 002 002 002 002 Shah M.

But as the size and frequency of micro data generation increased like IoT, Retail transactions, GPS, Smart Phones etc, demand for faster and realtime data mining algorithm have raised. Businesses requires decision to be taken in real-time with change in nature of the business operations and customer preferences. These demands can be fulfilled by mining data streams as they arrive before storing in the persistent storage 546 Experimented on Big Data context where the algorithm is tested on itemset and their support values Error gets introduced due to timely deletion of low density itemsets which can be improved to increase the accuracy of the closed frequent         1   1    1          Itemsets are stored in lattice format

Also data stream mining algorithms can be used on static data directly by reading the static data record by record as stream. But it is not possible to use any algorithm designed for static data mining to mine streaming data directly In this paper, we have performed a detailed analysis of the important techniques used till date to mine CFIs from uncertain continuous data streams and analyzed their advantages and limitations. Also the applicability of these algorithm for parallel and distributed computing environment to mine big streaming data is studied. From this study, few major research gaps have been identified and discussed in detail.

The architecture enables discovery or interesting patterns with data from different domains related to Telecom Network Monitoring. The architecture is composed of five sub-modules: Data Analyzer, Mining Controller, Data Miner, Combiner, and Episode Analyzer. Each sub-module is described in detail along with implementation approach  functions in turn. The approach leverages and combines frequent itemset discovery over data streams, association rule learning, frequent sequential pattern mining, and frequent temporal pattern mining techniques while also making use of distributed processing platforms to achieve high-volume throughput. To test the functionality of the model, three classic pattern mining algorithms, namely, NewMoment PrefixSpan, and HTPM, are implemented Their performances are compared in terms of different parameter settings by executing the algorithms with a simulated streaming dataset Fig.10

LI et al  PRIVACY-PRESERVING-OUTSOURCED ASSOCIATION RULE MINING ON VERTICALLY PARTITIONED DATABASES 1859 the publication of this seminal work a number of privacypreserving association rule mining or frequent itemset mining solutions have been published in the literature see 11   1 3   28]Ð[31 The most relevant work is the privacy-preserving association rule mining solution presented in I n t hi s s ol ut i on a d at a owner known as the master is responsible for the mining The other data owners known as slaves insert ctitious transactions to their respectiv e datasets and send the datasets to the master Each data owner will also send his set of real transactions IDs to a semi-trusted third-party server The third-party server is assumed not to be colluding with any data owner but it cannot be trusted to hold the raw data The master generates association rule candidates from the joint database containing ctitious data For each rule candidate X  Y  the master sends the ID lists of the transactions containing X  Y and the transactions containing X to the third-party server The server veriÞes if the rule is qualiÞed or not Similar to our solutions a semi-trusted third-party is utilized for the mining However unlike our solutions a data owner i.e the master does the majority of the computational work Therefore we can hardly say that such a solution is an outsourced mining solution Though ctitious data are added in datasets to lower data usability the master is able to learn signiÞcant information about other data owners raw data from the received datasets In cont rast our solutions do not leak such information as we do not rely on one particular data owner to undertake the computations and we also encrypt the datasets All existing solutions with the exception of  d

owners resulting in the leakage of information about the data owners raw data  The only exception is one of s s o l u t i ons  I n  13 t here are two privacy-preserving solutions for frequent itemset mining The rst solution exposes exact supports which is not desirable The second solution does not expose exact supports However association rules cannot be mined based on the result of second solution because conÞdences cannot be computed without the exact supports In addition this solutionÕs method cannot be used to mine association rules because securely computing conÞdence is more complicated than computing support In comparison with this solution our frequent itemset mining solutionÕs computational complexity is signiÞcantly lower Our solutions do not expose exact supports or conÞdences to data owners Different from existing solutions based on homomorphic encryption we use symmetric homomorphic encryption instead of asymmetric homomorphic encryption and the manner in which we use homomorphic encryption also differs from existing solutions In our approach we use homomorphic encryption to create ERVs and build our secure outsourced comparison scheme B Privacy-Preserving

and returns the result frequent itemsets and their supports to the data owner The data owner revises these itemsets supports by subtracting them with these itemsets corresponding occurrence counts in the ctitious transactions respectively Finally the data owner decrypts the received itemsets with the revised supports higher than the frequency threshold an d generates association rules based on

solution for vertically partitioned databases This allows the data owners to outsource mining task on their joint data in a privacy-preserving manner privacypreserving manner Based on this solution we built a privacypreserving outsourced association rule partitioned databases Our solutions protect data ownerÕs raw data from other data owners and the cloud Our solutions also ensure the privacy of the mining results from the cloud Compared with most existing solutions our solutions leak less information about the data owners raw data Our evaluation has also demonstrated that our solutions are very efÞci ent therefore our solutions are suitable to be used by data owners wishing to outsource their databases to the cloud but require a high level of privacy without compromising on performance To realize our solutions an efÞcient homomorphic encryption scheme and a secure outsourced comparison scheme were presented in this paper Both schemes have potential usage in other secure computation applications such as secure data aggregation beyond the data mining solutions described in this paper Demonstrating the u tility of the p roposed homomorphic encryption scheme and outsourced comparison scheme in other settings will be the focus of future research A PPENDIX I NSERTING F ICTITIOUS T RANSACTIONS  s A LGORITHM  An algorithm to counter frequency analysis attacks on the outsourced database encrypted with a substitution cipher was proposed in F or the purpos e o f c oncealing t he item frequency this algorithm inserts ctitious transactions in the database to be oursourced The goal is to ensure that each item share the same frequency with at least k  1 items The algorithm is summarized as follows also see  Firstly the data owner scans the database to count each individual itemÕs support  Secondly the data owner groups items considering the supports and co-occurrence of items The data owner sorts items in decreasing order of support Starting from the rst of the sorted item list i.e the item with the highest support the data owner assigns every k adjacent items to a new created group If there are less than k unassigned items remaining these items will be assigned to the last created group The data owner swaps items from different groups to ensure that all items in the same group do not occur together in the same transaction  Thirdly for each item in each group the data owner calculates the difference between the itemÕs support and the highest support in the group The difference is deÞned as the noise of the item  Fourthly to achieve k anonymity frequency the data owner generates ctitious transactions based on the result of the third step The number of an itemÕs occurrences in the ctitious transactions is equal to its noise calculated in the third step After inserting the ctitious transactions all items in the same group share the same support A CKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to thank Quach Vinh Thanh the Associate
