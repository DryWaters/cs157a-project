Mapping Surface Cover Using EO-1 Hyperion Data Ongoing Studies in Arid Environments  David W. Leverington Department of Geosciences Texas Tech University Lubbock, TX 79409   Abstract The utility of Hyperion images in the discriminat ion of surface classes is currently being tested at two st udy areas 1 eastern Melville Island Nunavut Canada and 2  Big Bend National Park, Texas.  Hyperion unmixing results fo 
r the Melville Island study area effectively depict fractional sur face cover although the abundance images of several classes co ntain background values that locally overestimate surface exposure.  At Big Bend National Park, separation of classes throu gh Hyperion unmixing has been hindered by the relatively indist inct weathering characteristics of several key sedimenta ry units Ongoing research efforts include experimentation wi th hyperspectral classification approaches that entail 
 reduction of Hyperion data dimensionality through the combinatio n of spectral bands Keywords- geology; desert regions; spectroscopy I   I NTRODUCTION  In the discrimination of surface cover classes, hyp erspectral data offer improved potential for class separation relative to broad-band multispectral data. Though EO-1 Hyperion data do not have optimal signal-to-noise characteristics t he data are notable in providing spectral coverage across almos 
t 200 functional bands that collectively span the visible  nearinfrared, and short-wave infrared ranges of the ele ctromagnetic spectrum  The effectiveness of Hyperion images in the discrimination of lithological and other surface co ver classes is currently being tested at Melville Island, Canada and Big Bend National Park, Texas \(Fig.1 II  H YPERION I MAGES  The Hyperion sensor 1  i s  o n e  o f  s e v e r a l  i n s t r u m e n ts mounted on the EO-1 spacecraft, which was launched

As with the surface materials of eastern Melville I sland, the materials of the Big Bend National Park study area are characterized by spectral troughs indicative of the presence of ferric iron, carbonate minerals, and clay minerals Fig.3\.  The spectral properties of several sedimentary end memb ers of interest in the study area Pen Formation shale Ag uja Formation sandstone Javelina Formation sandstone are variable across the park and substantially overlap within the study transect  Some end members including evapor ite deposits and mafic igneous units instead have rela tively distinct spectral properties  The presence of non-geological classes including sn ow and vegetation cover complicate discrimination of litho logical classes on Melville Island and in Big Bend National Park.  The state of surface materials is depicted for several field sites in Figs.4-6 V  U NMIXING AND C LASSIFICATION R ESULTS  Hyperion unmixing images for the Melville Island st udy area effectively depict the complexity of the fract ional cover of key end members and complement the simplified depictions provided by geological maps Fig.7 14  However Hyperion abundance images overestimate sur face exposure for classes including limestone, sandstone and snow Such overestimations are likely related both to ove rlap in the spectral properties of classes caused by similarit ies in the mineralogical and weathering characteristics of geo logical classes and the relatively low signal-to-noise cha racteristics of the Hyperion sensor.  Classes most clearly disti nguished in the Melville Island fraction images include snow g reen vegetation and sedimentary classes with distinct w eathering characteristics \(sandstones of the Canyon Fiord For mation and mudstones of the Assistance Formation  The utilit y of Hyperion unmixing results is superior to that of re sults generated through the unmixing of Landsat Thematic Mapper datasets 14    H o w e v e r   t h e  i n f o r m a t i o n  c o n t e n t  o f  separate neural network classifications generated from Thema tic Mapper imagery is comparable to that of the Hyperio n-derived fraction images  At the Big Bend National Park study area, a wide ra nge of surface cover classes can be distinguished through unmixing of Hyperion data  Classes most clearly distinguish ed in generated fraction images include green vegetation and igneous units of mafic composition 13    D i s c r i m i n ation of several sedimentary units of interest is hindered b y the relatively indistinct weathering characteristics of  associated materials \(Fig.3\.  Improved characterization of th e reflectance properties of these materials and of vegetation cl asses distributed across the imaged transect may ultimat ely allow for improved separation of sedimentary units in the study area  Though the Hyperion unmixing images generated for b oth the Melville Island and Big Bend National Park stud y areas provide useful information regarding the nature of fractional surface cover e.g allowing for quantitative sepa ration between the spectral contributions of lithological classes and discontinuous vegetation cover the overall inform ation content of these images is not in all cases superio r to that of images generated using simpler methods involving pe r-pixel classification of Landsat Thematic Mapper data  Re finement of the techniques and inputs used in unmixing exerc ises may allow for improvement in the utility of unmixing re sults VI  O NGOING W ORK  Ongoing research efforts include investigation of t he utility of fraction images for the quantitative characteriz ation of the lithological compositions of alluvial fans in Big B end National Park.  Efforts also include experimentation with hy perspectral classification approaches that entail reduction of Hyperion data dimensionality through the combination of spec tral bands Such approaches offer the potential to reduce noise  in Hyperion data while providing an improved basis for per-pixel classifications relative to established broadband m ultispectral image types such as Landsat Thematic Mapper   Figure 4  Exposure of geological materials is generally excel lent across much of the Melville Island study area The most common surface materials consist of thin veneers of felsenmeer, the lithologies of whic h generally correspond to those of underlying bedro ck units.

 It must be noted that most participating students are aware of cultural differences since the collaborating universities have impressively high percentages of international students. Therefore it was expected that team members would not have a cultural shock once the pilots would start. However it was evident that both cohorts were expecting a less culturally diverse student body on the other side of the Atlantic. These misperceptions were expressed through informal discussions with the instructors. In some teams culture caused some minor conflicts and affected slightly performance in terms of time needed to resolve conflicts. Surprisingly enough the only case of significant personality differences was caused among UK team members and after investigation it seems that could be attributed to team dynamics outside of the scope of this study  The six hours of time difference was an interesting perspective of the pilot since most students experienced this obstacle to collaboration for th e first time to such an extent. The introductory video conferencing session was proven quite useful since it gave the opportunity to familiarise with team members but also to prepare a schedule of meetings. Students found it quite useful to obtain each other s schedule and set up windows of possible synchronous communication. After the first week it seemed that there were two types of teams, the ones that realised that time delays should have been incorporated to their working schedules and the ones that attempted to neglect the time zone element with devastating effects towards the deadline  In terms of communication there were three main classifications of the collaborating teams. Highly interactive teams accumulated 70-80 messages for each pilot, with most teams having 40-50 posts relating to the tasks. Least interacting teams still achieved more than 20 posts in order to exchange vital information. Team members were not equally active and a clear pattern emerged with self-appointed team coordinators for each collaborating party. It is important to note that participants focused primarily on the task when communicating through the discussion board. Occasions where individuals attempted to use private communication tools were minimal since it was clear that the scenario would not accept such communication  It seems that basic communication tools pose no longer a constraint to efficient collaboration as it was observed in previous work in the 90s. It is evident that chat and discussion facilities are mastered by certain age groups prior to their university experience. However it was necessary to regulate video conferencing sessions between the different teams. Further work should investigate further the use of such tools  Finally collaboration between teams was based on working versions of the key document. There were two types of information exchange, one based on clarification comments and additional information and one relating to the working document. An important issue that was addressed with the help of the instructors was the delay in transmitting initial information in two teams. This issue was magnified due to the lack of synchronous communication and the number of hours each team remained idle due to the time zone difference. This factor will be an important one for future work with respect to the design of collaborative tasks  7. Lessons learnt  Following from the discussion above, it became evident that the pilot studies have caused several concerns regarding the viability of global software development learning teams. The authors are aware of how inappropriate it would be to generalise the lessons learnt from these pilots and attempt to draw conclusions for global teams in the software development industry  However, building on previous work of several funded projects that produced analytical results for various case studies in virtual settings and global team scenarios certain lessons learnt are presented and classified as an initial partly tested set of guidelines for further pilot studies  Quite early in the first pilot it was clear that maturity levels between collaborating students caused difficulties with respect to expectations, maturity, experience and code of conduct. It is necessary to align human resources  since both team effectiveness and communication between individuals may suffer from differences in background, skills, knowledge and experience. This factor was derived from problem caused by the differences in skills and experience of the collaborating teams  The kick off meetings for both pilots were based on synchronous communication that helped those teams that had most of their members participating in the ice breaking socialising part of the pilot. It seems that scheduling the synchronous meeting was a critical factor to distinguish team members according to motivation and interest. The emerged pattern showed that the more successful teams were the ones with their members attending all the synchronous meetings. This factor was derived from the significantly larger number of ice breaking posts in threads of those teams that did not participate in the synchronous meetings  The use of multimedia richness to enhance communication and collaboration was critical to overcome the barriers of culture, experience, work pattern and understanding of the task. It was clear that the video conferencing sessions helped to establish rapport and further support collaboration in those cases where remote teams allowed some personal interaction in a less formal context. This factor was derived from evidence of Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 


increased progress following the video conference and synchronous chat sessions helping team members to resolve conflicts and clarify misunderstandings relating to the task  As in most student-based pilots the use of participation incentives becomes even more necessary. The volunteering nature of the project carrying a rather small incentive in terms of extra credit and a small prize meant that more students had the opportunity to opt out from the study. An interesting pattern emerged with participation being affected by the level of cohesion that different groups showed.  Furthermore, it seemed that the second pilot \(being closely related to the first one and following after a short break after the completion of the initial task did not attract the same level of interest and there was inconsistency in terms of motivation for communication collaboration and exchange of ideas. Based on some early feedback comments, it seems that interest levels were affected by the nature of the task \(similar database projects\e team collaboration pattern \(the less active members failed to integrate even if it was only for the second pilot\d the rigid induction process \(although synchronous meetings were offered for the second pilot, it was difficult for least involved team members to catch up and identify their roles\This factor was derived from the different participation patterns of team members according to their perception of the provided incentives  It seems that several teams were positively affected by individuals who showed a lot of enthusiasm leading to heroic efforts and personal intervention These teams were the ones that at critical stages of the collaboration certain key people from both universities would proceed and finish off the deliverables. They were proactive at undertaking a team leader or facilitator role. This factor was derived from those teams that included individual team members undertaking full responsibility towards the end of the task in a completer-finisher role  Another critical aspect that affected all teams during both pilots was the dissemination of information that was based on the briefings posted on the virtual learning environment. The fact that part of the message was initially scrambled and that time zone differences posed a six hour delay meant that collaboration was significantly affected. This factor was derived from the communication of team members with the research team seeking further opportunities of briefings, leading to a number of additional briefing sessions  There is need to further research interaction and communication patterns of participants. For example some inconsistencies were observed with respect to loafing in different teams. Mr S.A. read 267 articles and posted 66 while Miss R.A. read 1016 followed by 28 posts with the worse example of loafing being Mr M.A with 5119 items read and only 2 posted messages Altogether there seems to be an association between the reading and posting patterns. There is also a correlation between the time spent in the environment and the reading of the communication within the team but not with the number of posts. It seems that a significant part of the team spent their time mainly for reading the specification and clarifying the task. This factor was derived from the different results and progress monitored in teams with significantly different communication patterns in terms of consistency, frequency and depth of information  The task domain databases\ affects the end result of the communicating team since it is quite practical and requires less clarification after the initial briefing installation and user help issues are covered. A more theoretical project would require further communication and decision making from the teams. This factor was derived from the different communication patterns followed for different tasks  Factors Source Impact Alignment of human resources TF/RA/MC High Synchronous communication TF/MC/CM Medium Multimedia richness CM/CL/MC Medium Participation incentives RA/CL/MC High Interest levels TF/RA/MC Medium Personal intervention MC/CL/RA High Information dissemination CM/MC/CL Medium Communication patterns CM/CL High Task domain CM/CL/MC High Deliverables MC/RA/CL Progress assessment MC/CL Key MC management/coordination  TF team formation RA role allocation CM communication CL collaboration Table 1: Factors affecting global teams  Furthermore, the design of any deliverables should be based on the needs of each team rather than the task leading to clear agenda items for each meeting that are owned by the different teams. This factor was derived from the communication patterns following a structure similar to the one required for the deliverables Progress assessment should be also based on the different goals of each team rather than the task overall goals. This factor was derived from the different agenda present in the collaborating teams  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 


 Figure 3: Framework for DSD influential factors  As shown in figure 3, the factors affecting global teams and influence DSD can be classified according to the two key variants concerning this project, namely task and team complexity. One of the objectives for the remaining two years of the project will be to identify ways of measuring and providing a more accurate classification of such factors. In the figure the horizontal axis shows how these factors relate to the complexity of the task in hand The vertical axis prioritises the factors affecting global teams according to the structure, communication and collaboration complexity of the team  8. Future Work - Towards a Third Pilot  From the previous sections it is evident that a number of factors affecting DSD and the work of global teams can be identified and their prioritisation may differ significantly depending on the structure of teams, the project tasks and external influences. Our experiences with the first two pilots concluded that it is important to investigate further our hypotheses in more realistic scenarios of distributed development, allowing alternative team structures and focusing on tasks from different stages of the lifecycle, including requirements capture design and programming, proving more demanding than testing in the way teams collaborate and communicate  The previous section provides an overview of the findings and lessons learnt from the two pilot studies between US and UK teams. A different project was assigned to teams residing in the US, Turkey and Panama. The three teams were asked to develop a system that could be used to create and manage groups.  Each country team was asked to deliver one of the components for this system. Each country team s deliverable was further refined into sub components which could be assigned to individual members of the country team. All three teams were required to collaborate on a common interface that supported each of their individual components  Although the factors affecting global teams were identified prior to the beginning of the third pilot they did not affect the design of the task. The aim of the project is to identify different collaboratio n settings and a variety of tasks that are feasible in global software teams. The identification of issues r elating to role allocation, team formation, management and coordination of such teams will have a different weighting according to the task and team structures  9.  Conclusion  This paper provided the basis for further work in global software development teams. The paper discussed the research foundation and provided an overview of the key aspects for the underlying research. It seems that setting up global team simulations is feasible in an educational context but certain difficulties exist when aligning curriculum, working ethos, deadlines and incentives.

This figure presents the data flow through main blocks that can be used a few times and special blocks that must execute only particular functions Here also Configurator of chain and Sequences library for WiMAX/UMTS modules are equipped First one is responsible for right construction of next processing path and second one stores necessary number of elements After signal verification system is reconfigured according to input data and with using the chosen protocol type The OUTPUT connects to radio link and then signal must be transmitted over one of six channel types And at the reception side we configure the receiver in relation to transmitted mode 5 HARDWARE PLATFORM SELECTION Current technologies in a hardware environment allow to test our system in real-time implementation There are a couple of DSP based platforms that can be selected for validation from Lyrtech Inc the Small Form Factor SFF Software Communication Architecture SCA Development the Small Form Factor SFF Softwaredefined Radio SDR Development Platform the Small Form Factor SFF Software-defined Radio SDR Evaluation Module 20 All these platforms are based on TMS320DM6446 DMP SoC from Texas Instruments 21 For the proposed SDR based system we chose the SFFSDR Evaluation board see Figure 13 as far as this platform supports WiMAX technology model based design tools accelerating prototyping implementation of all protocols layers for complete radio stacking extra boards operates with 297MHz ARM926EJ-s RISC CPU and 594MHz C64x DSP in sense of power management this module has MSP430 MCU Due to an availability of Virtex-4 SX35 FPGA from Xilinx 22 this module can perform implementation of full modem processing functions that is very important feature in meaning of multi-protocol architecture of our system We are able to vary our requirements to each protocol inside the same hardware structure Figure 13 SFF SDR development platform by Lyrtech 6 PROTOTYPING THE WiMAX/UMTS SYSTEM The WiMAX/UMTS system is implemented in high-level language as C with the class library The main accent was done on the correct form of the signal processing sequence The path for WiMAX or UMTS signal is determined in the beginning and system should verify its entity leads the system in a relevant direction The main goal of this software implementation is to check how our system can handle the input signal sequence The simulation was carried out for following parameters for each subsystem For UMTS we consider transport block with 1280 bits size frame size is 2400 bits channelization code with 16 chips sequence For WiMAX we generate the bit block is equal to 1280 bits however during channel coding operation this block is divided on turbo coding block that include 384 bits The size of turbo coding block forms from the block determination corresponding modulation type and number of subchannels During software verification we obtained that our proposed model can separate different paths subject to a type of an inter sequence in the software environment The framework of our WiMAX/UMTS system went through one scenario step and now we are directed to an extension of this model For the more detailed system visualization we integrate our C code modules into MATLAB library by means of proper dynamic linking libraries dll compiled by using the MATLAB C compiler Each block can be formed with extended parameters Modules with C code configurate the system work in a host This host implementation will present a prototype This prototype will help to analyze future real-time hardware implementation MATLAB prototype can also provide debugging of real system the result of real system must be equal to our MATLAB prototype Next step of the work development and verification is to implement it into the hardware platform based on DSP DSP based platform allows to organize signal processing in a digital presentation that serves SDR based part of our general system 7 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we considered the framework of WiMAX/UMTS baseband level system for mobile device in UL transmission direction We presented the different signal processing structures based on OFDM and WCDMA physical layer procedures Our research work is mainly devoted to developing the approach of seamless switching between different subsystems that can be realized by SDR technology implementation To this end we proposed a possible solution to allow coexistence of different data transmission technologies 11
