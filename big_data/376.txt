A Probability based Subnet Selection Method for\nHot Event Detection in Sina Weibo Microblogging\nPei Shen\nShanghai Jiaotong University\nshenpei310@sjtu.edu.cn\nYi Zhou*\nShanghai Jiaotong University\nzy 21th@sjtu.edu.cn\nKai Chen\nShanghai Jiaotong University\nkchen@sjtu.edu.cn\nAbstract—Microblogging has become a popular means of\ncommunication and information diffusion. Due to the huge\namount of microblogs generated daily, the communication and\ncomputing costs required for real hot event detection is a big\nchallenge Choosing a small subnet of nodes to detect events\nhas received increasing research interests in recent years But\nthe previous methods manage to select nodes to cover all the\nevents including less popular events in sample datasets under\nthe limited subnet size, which cause a big difference of event\ndetection ratio between sample events and online real events in\nmicroblogs. In this paper we propose a new subnet nodes selection\nscheme based on the event detection ratio and nodes’ events\nparticipation probabilities. Under the requirement of average\nevent detection ratio, we prefer to choose the nodes who are\nactive in propagating hot events than the nodes who participate\nin the less popular events. And we take dynamic programming\nto accelerate the computing. The experimental results show that\nour proposed method has a better performance.\nI INTRODUCTION\nMicroblog is becoming a very popular social network for\ncommunication and information sharing Many events with\nsocietal impacts are ?rst reported in and propagated via\nmicroblogging services before they were taken up by main\nstream media, making microblogging an important source of\nnews update. Detecting hot events in microblogging is of\nincreasing research interest. Although the microblogging ser-\nvice providers publish hot events regularly, only very limited\nnumber of hot events of generic interests are selected which\nmay not meet the needs of users with interests in speci?c topics\nor users with commercial interests for marketing and product\npromotion purposes. More critically, the decision as to the\nselection of hot events to publish by those service providers\nmay be subject to censorship and their commercial considera-\ntions also play important role. The undesirability of relying on\nmicroblogging service providers for hot events select motivates\nthe research and development of systems by third party in\norder to achieve topic-speci?city and unbiasedness. In this\npaper we are interested in the detection of hot events in\nSina Weibo, which is the dominant microblogging platform\nin China.\nHowever, microblog hot event detection presents several\nsigni?cant challenges. Compared with other social network\nservices such as blogs, microblogging has distinct features\nin terms of the number of users and the volume and the\n*Corresponding author.\nsize of microblogs. A total of 30 million active users post\nnearly one hundred million microblogs daily in Sina Weibo\n[1]. Most of the reported works on microblogging hot event\ndetection have been focused on analyzing the text content of\nmicroblogs [2 3], [4], [5]. Processing a huge number of short\nsize microblogs generated in real-time for hot event detection\nis expected to have large communication and computation\ncosts. In paper [6], Social network has been compared to a\ncity water distribution network and each node is consider to\nsurely propagate a event in social network when the event is\npropagated to the node. The CELF algorithm in [6] selects\na subnet of nodes which detects all the past events and\nexpects the subnet to be more possible to detect all future\nevents. Inspired by the work reported in [6], our previous\nwork [7] provide an online detection methods of hot events\nunder resource constraints, it strategically selects and monitors\nonly a small subset of microbloggers in order to satisfy\nboth the resource budget and event coverage requirements for\neffective detection. The problem of nding a proper subset\nof microbloggers is formulated as mixed-integer optimization\nproblems for which heuristic algorithms are developed to\ncompute their approximate solutions. The subnet can cover\neach sample hot event for a certain DoC, but we found that\nthe subnet had a much lower DoC on real events, which is\ncaused by randomness of nodes propagation in events. In\npaper [8], a subnet of nodes of max in?uence is selected\nand in?uence is considered to propagate with probability from\none node to another. Although the subnet with max in?uence\ndoes not mean it participates in a lot of events, which does\nnot ?t our system, but the probability of propagation is a\ngreat inspiration. CELF algorithm was apply well to water\ndistribution system that each node is surely to propagate a\ncontaminant, but in microblogging network, a node propagates\na event with probability. A node’s behavior of propagating a\nevent can be affected by their interest, mood, timetable and so\non. In previous work [6], [7], they manage to select nodes to\ncover all the events in sample datasets however some of these\nsample events are about speci?c topic or less popular, which\ncause getting some inactive nodes. Though the detection ratio\nin sample dataset is very high, the real online detection ratio\nis much more lower. Hence, we think that we should not focus\non whether one past hot event is detected or not, but focus on\nwhich nodes are more active in propagating events.\nIn this paper, we focus on reducing the adverse effect of ran-\n2013 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining\n1410\nASONAM'13, August 25-29, 2013, Niagara, Ontario, CAN  \nCopyright 2013 ACM 978-1-4503-2240-9 /13/08 15.00\ndomness on hot event participation from the candidate nodes.\nWe introduce a notion of hot event 


participation probability\nbased on statistic and propose a new node selection algorithm\nto improve hot event detection performances. The hot event\nparticipation probability of a node re?ects how active a node\nparticipates in hot events. Further, it re?ects the ability that\na node can help to detect hot events. In our algorithm, we\nchoose nodes with the highest event participation probability\nfrom a large number of candidate nodes to form the smallest\nsubnet of nodes, which can detect a general hot event with a\ncertain probability.\nII. OVERALL SYSTEM FRAMEWORK\nA. Sample Data Retrieving\nThere are a huge of number of topics widely present in\nmicroblog networks every day, making it next to impossible\nto process every topics diffused over the networks. To reduce\nthe communication and computation loads we select only hot\ntopics to construct our sample data. There are several very\npopular Chinese websites, which provide ranking lists of hot\ntopics and we fetch key words of sample events from these\nwebsite. In this way, we can ensure that almost every event\n\(topic composed of all the\nmicroblogs \(including their reposts via Sina API. Every microblogger in\nan event propagation link is called a participant. We ?lter an\nevent if the number of participants in this event is less than a\nthreshold \(such as 800 considered\nto be hot events.\nB. Subnet Microbloggers Selection\nThere are a huge number of nodes in the sample dataset.\nTo make detection system faster and more accurate, we do the\nfollowing ?ltering job:\n• We ?lter the nodes with a number of followers less than\na threshold \(such as 200 microblogging network.\n• We ?iter the nodes with a participation number of hot\nevents less than a threshold such as 2 number of microblog\nspammers, we ?lter nodes with following behaviors:\n– Repeatedly retweet on the same hot event for a large\nnumber of times\n– Very active and participate in most of the hot events\neven they may have very few fans\n– Include the titles of many hot events in their adver-\ntisement microposts by hash tags\nAfter the above ?ltering process, the size of the sample\ndataset to be used for node selection can be signi?cantly\nreduced. Finally we select a subset of nodes to monitor in\norder to effectively detect hot events while minimize the\ncommunication and computation costs for hot event detection.\nThe algorithm of subnet selection is a key for our hot event\ndetection system and next we present the algorithm and\nevaluate its performances under the detection.\nIII. SELECTION OF SUBNET AND EVALUATION\nA. Subnet Selection Algorithm\nAssume that we have a set of sample hot events denoted by\nE and a set of N candidate nodes S\(S = {n1, n2 nN i 1, N i ?

The algorithm takes the sample hot event\nset E and two parameters, Ndet and Pdetthr as inputs. Ndet is\na preset threshold which DoC of a detected hot event should\nexceed and Pdetthr is a threshold on the expected hot event\ndetection probability.

There are 30,456 hot propagation links\nrelated to these hot events containing 5,011,276 retweets and\n2,817,822 nodes. 294 of the collected hot events are used\nas sample hot events and the total number of retweets is\n2,605,032 and the number of nodes is 1,622,843. The rest 231\nhot events are used as real-time test dataset. The 294 sample\nhot events happend from 4th September to 21st Octorber,2012\nand the rest 231 hot events happend from 22nd Octorber,2012\nto 11th December 2012. We use the 294 sample hot events\nto learn a subnet of nodes in order to see if the subnet can\ndetect the 231 hot events ”in the future”. Since there are\nTABLE I: Statistic of datasets\nType # of hot events During\nsample 294 4th Sep - 21st Oct\nreal-test 231 22nd Oct - 11th Dec\n1,622,843 nodes participating in sample hot events, which\nhave adverse effect on the speed performance of our system,\nwe ?lter the nodes with fans less than 500 or nodes which\nparticipate in less than 2 hot events. Distribution of participants\non number of followers in sample dataset is shown in Table\nII and the distribution of users on hot event participation in\nsample dataset is shown in Table III.

Algorithm N -CELF has an input parameter Ndet. It\niteratively picks the node which participates in most currently\nundetected hot events, and the subnet should participate in\neach sample hot event by at least Ndet times as a condition to\nend the algorithm. In other words, it ensures that each sample\nhot event is detected by the subnet.\nIn our experiments, parameter Pdetthr is set to 0.99 for\nalgorithm ECRS. We set Pdetthr close to 1 so that the subnet\ndetecting hot events is expected to be a certain event. Ndet is\nset to 9, 17, 32, 45 for which algorithm ECRS ?nd a subnet\nof about 250, 500, 1000, 1500 nodes and N -CELF ?nd a\nsubnet of 211, 435, 933, 1457 nodes, respectively. To make\nthe scale of each subnet of different algorithm fair, we continue\nN -CELF algorithm until we get subnet of 250, 500, 1000,\n1500 nodes respectively. We also use algorithms Rand and\nMostFol to select a subnet of 250, 500, 1000, 1500 nodes,\nrespectively for performance comparison.\nTable IV presents the performance of different node se-\nlection algorithms over sample dataset. We can observe that\nRand algorithm has a poor performance as expected, but\nMostFol algorithm also has a low ratio of detected sample\nhot events, which may indicate that the nodes who have many\nfollows do not necessarily participate in many hot events. N -\nCELF algorithm have a hot events detection rate of 100%\nin the sample hot events, because when N -CELF algorithm\nends, the subnet should participate in each sample hot event\nby at least Ndet times. The proposed algorithm ECRS has\na good but not the best performance in detecting sample hot\nevents, but it does not mean ECRS algorithm is not as good\nas N -CELF algorithm.\n2013 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining\n1412\nTABLE IV: Comparison over sample dataset\nAlgorithm Ndet # of\nselected\nnodes\nAverage\nDoC\n% of hot\nevents being\ndetected\nECRS 9 248 23.5 84%\nECRS 17 499 47.2 82.7%\nECRS 32 999 76.6 77.2%\nECRS 45 1501 101.0 73.1%\nN-CELF 9 250 19.1 100%\nN-CELF 17 500 32.5 100%\nN-CELF 32 1000 54.3 100%\nN-CELF 45 1500 72.3 100%\nRand 9 250 2.7 8.2%\nRand 17 500 6.2 8.2%\nRand 32 1000 12.3 8.5%\nRand 45 1500 17.5 8.5%\nMostFol 9 250 8.5 37.8%\nMostFol 17 500 12.9 25.5%\nMostFol 32 1000 22.3 22.1%\nMostFol 45 1500 30.1 21.4%\nTable V presents the performance of different node selection\nalgorithms over real-test dataset. From the result presented\nin Table V, We can observe that algorithm ECRS performs\nmuch better than algorithm N -CELF in the real-test dataset.\nFor the same threshold of Ndet, the average DoC and the\nratio of detected hot events with algorithm ECRS is 20%\nto 30% more than those with algorithm N -CELF in real-\ntime test dataset. The disadvantage of N -CELF algorithm is\nthat it expects that if sample hot events have a detection rate\nof 100%, the real-test hot events will also have a very high\ndetection rate. In our

CONCLUSION\nOur previous methods manage to select nodes to cover all\nthe events including less popular events in sample datasets\nunder the limited subnet size, which cause a big difference\nof event detection ratio between sample events and online\nreal events in microblogs. In our research, we ?nd that nodes\nparticipate in events with probability. We propose a new\nnode selection algorithm called ECRS, which is based on\nthe statistical probability of hot event participation by the\ncandidate nodes, to reduce the adverse effect of randomness on\nhot event participation from the candidate nodes. We compare\nECRS algorithm with N -CELF algorithm, which does not\ntake the effect of the randomness into consideration, and ?nd\nthat ECRS algorithm have a 20% to 30% better performance\nin real-test dataset.\nIn our future work, we plan to take the cost of each node\ninto account and propose a Cost-Effective ECRS algorithm\nso that it can be compared with NewInd algorithm in [7]. We\nalso plan to test the ECRS algorithm with data at larger scale\nand investigate the impact of the parameters on the algorithm\nperformances. The subnet of nodes will be updated when we\nget new hot events to get better performance.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe work is partially supported by National Natural Sci-\nence Foundation of China \(Grant No. 61025005, 61129001,\n61201384 National Grand Fundamental Research 973\nProgram of China \(Grant No.2010CB731406 Fundamental Research 863 Program of China \(Grant\nNo. 2011AA01A107863   Mathioudakis, M., & Koudas, N. \(2010, June Proceedings of the 2010 international\nconference on Management of data \(pp. 1155-1158  Okazaki, M., & Matsuo, Y. \(2010, April sensors.

There is also no great \ndifference between 50 hammer and 100% hammer \ndrilling. One would have expected a much larger increase in \npenetration rate when piezo-hammer is engaged. However, \nthe small benefit of the hammer in this case is probably due \nto the low rock strength and very effective cuttings bit \ndesign. If a rock has low strength, rotary drill can easily npenetrate it \(cutting teeth can dig into a rock at modest \nWeight on Bit values hammer is \nlow. The benefit of a hammer system, however, could be \nbetter seen in hard rocks.  \n \nFigure 7 Rate of Penetration vs. Weight on Bit for \nRotary, Rotary-Percussive with 50% duty cycle, and nRotary-Percussive drilling. \nFigure 8 shows Total Power \(including 50 Watt for the \npiezo-hammer system Weight on Bit for Rotary, \nRotary-Percussive with 50% duty cycle, and Rotary-\nPercussive drilling. The main difference in power is \nbetween rotary and rotary-percussive, since piezo-hammer \nrequired additional 50 Watt Note that there is little \ndifference in power as a function of Weight on Bit. Since \nwith larger Weight on Bit cutters would dig in deeper, it has \nto be concluded that drilling resistance even at deeper cuts \nwas relatively low. Another way to interpret these results is \nthat the resistance of the rock to individual cutters was \napproximately the same for deep and shallow cuts. This of \ncourse is counter-intuitive because one would expect large \nresistance \(and in turn higher torque and power plausible explanation for this anomaly is \nthat rock was relatively weak and did not offer much \nresistance to the drill.  \n \nFigure 8.

The penetration rate \nand energy at 90 rpm/120 Newton and 40rpm/250 Newton \nare the same. Hence doubling the rpm has the same effect \non the penetration rate as doubling the WOB. \n \nFigure 9.

is 100 MPa \(i.e. 4x the strength of the limestone rock \nused for testing rate \nwould be 4x lower and the required energy to penetrate 1 m \nwould be 4x higher.

FIELD TESTS TO 3 M DEPTH  \nThe purpose of the field test was to demonstrate drilling and \ncore recover to 3 m depth. The secondary goal was to obtain \ndrilling telemetry and extrapolate the drill time, and energy \nto greater depths.  \nLocation and Logistics \nThe field tests took place at the US Gypsum Company \ngypsum quarry outside Borrego Springs from 27-29 \nNovember, 2012. The exact coordinates are:  \n33°00'56.7786", -116°04'48.1694" and elevation: 398.8 feet.  \nThe team is shown in Figure 11 and included engineers and \nscientist from Honeybee Robotics, NASA Jet Propulsion \nLaboratory, and University of Southern California. \nGypsum deposits are up to 200 feet thick and average 125 \nfeet in thickness [11]. Anhydrite is found in the lower part \nof the evaporates.  \nThe strength of the gypsum was measured using a Schmidt \nhammer and determined to be in the range of 30-40 MPa. \nThe US Gypsum \(operator of the quarry 38 MPa ±2 MPa. \nDuring the first day, the team traveled from Pasadena to the \nfield site. The same day the camp was established and the \ndrill unpacked and integrated. All the operations were \nperformed within protective tent. This has been instrumental \nto the success of the field campaign, since the location at ntimes was extremely windy, hot during the day and cold in \nthe evening.  \nDrilling was performed over a 3 hour period till 8pm and to \na depth of 70 cm. During the second day, drilling started at \n9am and ended at 8pm, at the depth of 235 cm. On the third \nday, drilling started at 9am and ended at noon – i.e. when \nthe depth of 3 m was reached. \n \nFigure 11. The Field Team included \(left to right Mellerowicz, Ola Rzepiejewska \n\(Honeybee Robotics NASA JPL USC NASA JPL Honeybee Robotics Drilling Process \nThe drilling process included coring to 10 cm depth, \nretracing the AutoGopher from the hole, cleaning out the \ncuttings from catch basket above the core barrel, manually \nbreaking and capturing the core with a break-off tool \n  9 \n\(Figure 12 cm run. \n  \nFigure 12. Left to right: 1 Full size core \ncatcher; 4 used: shorter and \nlonger as shown in Figure 12. The shorter version is ideal \nfor breaking 5 cm long cores or 10 cm cores which are in a \nsingle piece. The long core catcher was designed to house \nand retain the entire length of the 10 cm long and was \nideally suited for cores that had mid shear planes such as \none shown in Figure 14 B. \nFigure 13 shows drilling progression. Since the total length \nof the AutoGopher was 190 cm, once the depth of 190 cm \nwas reached, the entire drill fit within the hole. Therefore, \nthe top anchors braced the borehole wall to provide drill \nstability.  \nFigure 15 shows the side wall and bottom of the 3 m hole. \nAfter each 10 cm, the drill operator looked down the hole to \ndetermine the state of the core \(whether it broke or was in-\ntact core barrel \(as \nshown in Figure 14 A which caused problems bottom of the hole \(Figure 14 C the disk rattled in place, the cutting teeth had difficulty \nbiting in and as a result, the drill motor kept on stalling. \nNote the side ring cut into the rock by the core bit. The end \nsolution was to suction lift the loose rock disks using a long \nvacuum cleaner hose.  \nIt should be noted that future field campaigns should include \nborehole cameras for inspecting of borehole walls and the \nstate of the core in the hole. \nThe majority of cores were in a single solid piece as shown \nin Figure 14 D. These were very easy to break-off and ncapture. A couple of other cores sheared at approximately \n45°, and required a full length core catcher \(i.e a core \ncatcher extending the full length of the core as opposed to \nhalf-length as shown in Figure 14 A. An example of such as \ncore is shown in Figure 14 B. In rare occasions, the cores \nwould include the bottom of the hole, that is at the point of \nfracture, the core diameter was large than the ID of the core \ndrill but smaller than the OD of the core drill \(i.e. smaller \nthan the borehole diameter neffect. A core of this type is shown in Figure 14 E.  \nWe observed that the surfaces of the cores were covered by \nthe fine drill cuttings, effectively obscuring the actual rock. \nTo inspect the rock, one had to look at the fracture surface.  \nWe also noticed that at various depths, the rock cores \nincluded iron-bearing minerals and clays. Hence, the \nformation was not pure gypsum. \n \nFigure 13. Drilling progress. From left to right: 1 i.e. first hole above \nthe hole; 3 drill at ~300 cm depth

The AutoGopher Drill above the 3 m deep \nhole \(note the yellow tape The 32 rock cores are placed \ninside the 4 protective tubes. \nDrilling Telemetry \nDuring the course of the drill test, we acquired drilling \ntelemetry such as power, penetration rate and Weight on Bit \nto estimate the resources required from a spacecraft during \nplanetary missions. In addition, we varied percussive \nduration and duty cycles to optimize drilling efficiency.  \nWe found that the average penetration rate for the 3 m hole nwas 1 m per hour \(or 3 hours for a 3 m hole hole, \nempty the catch basket of drilled cuttings, retrieve the core, \nand lower the drill back into the hole For a 3 m hole, these \noperations totaled approximately 10 hours. In addition, we \nexperienced approximately 4 hours of downtime due to \nbroken wire that had to be repaired and issues related to \nmisalignment between the anchor above the hole and the \nborehole itself. The latter one is of particular importance \nsince it will have to be addressed via re-design or \noperational sequencing. We found that having a half of the \nanchor pads are above the hole and the bottom half are in \nthe hole induces abnormally high WOB values. This is a \nresult of small misalignment between the hole and the \ndeployment system. Ideally, the anchors would have to be \nfully above the hole or in the hole – in either of the cases, \nthe WOB was nominal.  \nFigure 17 shows the rate of penetration \(ROP percussion is used and increase with an \nincrease in the duty cycle, reaching maximum at 100% duty \ncycle i.e. percussion always on nresults in high penetration rate. If the on/off periods are \nincreased to 5 seconds, the penetration rate drops by 50% \nthough. This implies that during the ‘off’ periods, \npenetration rate is very low.  \nWe also found that with the percussion system on, the WOB \nand rotary power would decrease. In some instances, the nrotary actuator would stall whenever percussive system was \nturned off.  \n \nFigure 17. Penetration Rate as a function of Percussive \nPower and duty cycle. \nFigure 18 shows the energy in Whr required to drill one \nmeter hole \(i.e. Whr per meter i.e. Auger power and Percussive npower nmechanisms was negligible.  \n  11 \nIt can be concluded that the most energy efficient drilling \nwith the AutoGopher has been when the percussive \nmechanisms was active at 100% duty cycle \(that is \ncontinuous fact, it takes approximately 200 Whr to drill \n1 meter. The least efficient approach is rotary drilling with nno percussion.  \n \nFigure 18. Drilling Energy per meter of depth as a \nfunction of Percussive Power and duty cycle. \n6. CONCLUSIONS  \nOne of the most pressing questions in space science that we \nare currently faced with is whether life has ever arisen \nanywhere else in the universe. Since water is a critical \nprerequisite for all Earth-based life as we know it, the \nnearest-known exploration targets for extraterrestrial life are nMars, Europa, and Enceladus. Due to the oxidizing nature of \nMars’ surface, as well as high radiation levels at the surfaces \nof Mars, Europa and Enceladus, the search for existing life \nmust likely focus on subsurface locations, at depths \nsufficient to allow liquid water. \nThe main feature of the developed Auto-Gopher is its nwireline operation. The drill is suspended on a tether and the \nmotors and mechanisms are built into a tube that ends with a \ncoring bit. The tether provides the mechanical connection to \na rover/lander on a surface as well as power and data \ncommunication. Upon penetrating to a target depth, the drill \nis retracted from the borehole, the core is deposited into a \nsample transfer system, and the drill is lowered back into the \nhole nThis wireline system allows core acquisition from depths \nlimited only by the length of a deployment tether Wireline \noperation sidesteps one of the major drawbacks of \ntraditional continuous drill string systems by obviating the \nneed for multiple drill sections, which add significantly to \nthe mass and the complexity of the system.  \nThe Auto-gopher has been successfully tested in a \nlaboratory environment in 25 MPa Texas crème limestone \nrock to a depth of 2 m. The average drilling power was in \nthe range of 100-150 Watt, while penetration rate was \napproximately 2.5 m/hr. The energy required to penetrate 1 \nm depth in Texas crème limestone was measured to be 60 \nWhr. \nThe Auto-gopher has also been successfully tested in a field nenvironment in 40 MPa Gypsum in the US Gypsum Quarry \noutside Borrego Springs, CA to a depth of 3 m. The average \ndrilling power was in the range of 100-350 Watt \(depending \non the duty cycle of the percussive system no percussion percussion at 100% duty 


cycle percussion at 100% duty cycle to 450 Whr/m \(no \npercussion depth. The most energy \nefficient drilling was found when the percussive mechanism \nwas activated continuously. It required approximately 200 \nWhr to drill 1-meter. The rotary drilling with no percussion \nwas found to be the least efficient approach. \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nResearch reported in this manuscript was conducted at \nHoneybee Robotics and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory \n\(JPL under a contract \nwith National Aeronautics Space Administration \(NASA for Exploring Planets \n\(ASTEP staff at the US Gypsum for assisting in the \nAutoGopher field deployment at the US Gypsum quarry in \nBorrego Springs, CA.

Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA.

Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
