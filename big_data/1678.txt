INTRODUCTION \nWith the rapid development of sensing communications, \nand analytics technologies, information is being generated, \ncollected, managed and analyzed automatically rather than \nfollowed the traditional information processing process. \nEmerging technologies such as Wireless Sensor Network \n\(WSN RFID CEP extension of physical world networking and \ndevelopment of information systems have promoted a new \ntype of network, called Internet of Things \(IoT anything for pervasive object identification, data \ncapture and intelligent information processing at any time, in \nanywhere and for anyone [1][2]. This intelligent \nidentification, positioning, tracking, monitoring and \nmanagement system has been put into applications in various \nfields [3]. As shown in Figure 1, we suggest a layered \narchitecture of IoT which is consisted of four layers. \n Sensing Layer is a connection between physical and \ncyber worlds. It contains various devices for information \ncollection such as RFID reader infrared sensor, GPS \nsystem, monitoring camera, etc. Ubiquitous perception is \nan important feature for what IoT is different from other \nnetworks. With the help of sensing layer, IoT can \nachieve a real-time monitoring and management on the \nobjects properties or behavior patterns. \n Network Layer is the media to convey the collected data \nto upper layers for further processing and higher-level \nabstraction. The usage of IPv4/IPv6 based Internet, \n3G/4G wireless networks and private networks provides \nIoT a seamless control over pervasive objects. \n Middleware Layer is a crucial part in IoT architecture. \nIoT middleware is an effective integration of several \nmajor functions including communications management, \ndevices management, data processing, semantic \nreasoning, information security and service interfaces. \nIoT middleware provides service interfaces for \napplications allowing users to get rid of the trivial details \nin sensing and network layers.\n Application Layer is established based on the three \nlower layers and provides domain-oriented IoT napplications for end-users in various application ndomains.\nDevice\nManagement\nMiddlewareLayer\nNetworkLayer\nSensingLayer\nPrivateNetwork Internet WirelessNetwork\nCommunication\nManagement\nRadioFrequency\nIdentification\nInfrared\nSensor\nGPS Camera\nTemperature\nSensor\nComplex\nEnviornment\nSemantic\nProcessing\nInformation\nSecurity\nData\nProcessing\nAppl ication\nServices\n nPublic\nSafty\nApplicationLayer\nIntelligent\nHealthcare\nEnvironment\nMonitoring\nSmart\nHome\nSupplyChain\nManag ement\nSmart\nTransportation\n \nFigure 1. Layered Architecture of IoT\nAccording to this layered architecture how to manage \ndata effectively and intelligently is the core research \nchallenge in IoT development. IoT data management \ninvolves the process of data collection, processing, storage \nand analysis. The first and primary purpose is to collect \(and \nclean data structures. Secondly, high-level \ninformation needs to be extracted, abstracted and inferred \nfrom raw data for decision supports. Eventually, how to store \nand analyze large amount of data is also a key research issue \nfor IoT applications. \nMuch work has been done to enable effective and \nintelligent data processing and analysis when IoT is evolving \nfrom RFID, WSN and other related technologies. There are \nseveral papers surveyed related research in various aspects. \nDifferent IoT data types and characteristics are surveyed in n2013 IEEE International Conference on Green Computing and Communications and IEEE Internet of Things and IEEE Cyber,\nPhysical and Social Computing\n978-0-7695-5046-6/13 $26.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/GreenCom-iThings-CPSCom.2013.199\n1144\n  \nthe view of database management [4]. Challenges and napproaches have also been concluded from the perspective of \ndata-centric and energy-efficient respectively 


5][6]. \nHowever, the overall management structure and key topics \nsuch as CEP and middleware research have not been closely \nexamined. Although there are studies on the IoT data \nmanagement framework [7][8], the detailed approaches not \nanalyzed. Therefore, a comprehensive survey and analysis on \nthis topic is still needed. In this paper, we review and \nexamine current research effort to derive a holistic view of \nrelated works, from which we identify research challenges \nand discuss possible directions for future work. \nThis paper is organized as follows: We analyze the data \ncharacteristic in IoT systems and then present a reference nmodel for IoT data management in Section II. Section III \ndetails the analysis on existing research for IoT data \nmanagement and also the research opportunities. We \nconclude the research and the future works in Section IV. \nII. IOT DATA CHARACTERISTICS AND MANAGEMENT \nREFERENCE MODEL \nIn this section, we start with an analysis of IoT data \ncharacteristic and then present a data management reference \nmodel for IoT. \nA. Data Characteristics \nIn general, IoT Data shares five distinct characteristics: \n Heterogeneity: IoT uses different properties in various \ndata types to describe the status of the “things”. These \ndata types vary from integer to character, also including \nsemi-structured and unstructured data such as audio and \nvideo streams [9]. \n Inaccuracy: One of the primary factors limiting the wide \nspread adoption of IoT is the inaccuracy of the data \nproduced [10]. For example, experiments show that \nRFID systems can only capture 60 to 70% correct data \ncaused by unreliable readings which leads to difficulties \nfor direct use [11]. The same situation exists in most \nother sensing technologies. \n Massive Real-Time Data: IoT is designed to connect nthousands of objects in large scale. Communications \nbetween different entities in dynamic networks generate na large volume of heterogeneous data in the form of \nreal-time, high-speed, uninterrupted data streams nScalable storage, filtering and compression schemes are \nessential for efficient big data processing [12].\n Implicit Semantics: Unprocessed IoT data is of low-level \nwith weak semantics [13]. In order to support nhigher-level applications, such as smart home and \nintelligent healthcare, complex semantics need to be nabstracted in event-driven perspective from the mass of \nlow-level data. \nB. The IoT Data Management Reference Model \nAccording to these mentioned characteristics, we present \na three-layered reference model for application design \(see \nFigure 2 Layer: As the reliability of current IoT \nsystems is far from practical usage, data cleaning is \nessential for the correct interpretation and analysis of \nIoT data. The primary target of this layer is to diminish \nthe data unreliability. Given the enormous volume of \ninformation, heterogeneous sources of errors, and \nreal-time processing requirements, it can be a \nchallenging task.\n Event Processing Layer: Cleansed IoT data is of high nreliability and usability. But raw data only provides \nsimple information, which is not directly related to nbusiness processes. The event processing layer \ninferences and transforms raw data into higher-level nbusiness logic. Semantic-based CEP technique is applied \nfor this purpose which will be explained in Section III.\n Data Storage and Analysis Layer: Having the data in the \nform of business logics, IoT systems should provide \nservices in various aspects and store them with proper \nschema. Such a schema should compress the amount of \ndata and support analysis in a variety of hierarchies.\nBigData\nStorageand\nCompressing\nData\nSource1\nData\nSource2\nData\nSourcen1\nData\nSourcen\n DataAnalysis\nandMining\n…\n…\nStorageandAnalysis\nLayer\nEventProcessing\nLayer\nDataCleaning\nLayer IoTApplication\nPublic\nSafty\nIntelligent\nHealthcare\nSmart\nHome\nSupplyChain\nManagement\nRawData ServiceInterface\n……\nHeterogeneous\nDataSources\nStreamData\nCleaning\nFramework\nTemporal\nGranule\nApproaches\nSp atial\nGranule\nApproaches\nGraph\nbasedCEP\nAutomata\nbasedCEP\nPetrinet\nbasedCEP\nFigure 2.

With in-depth analysis, we identify the research nopportunities for each issue. \nA. Data Cleaning Layer \nThe concept of data cleaning was firstly introduced in ndate warehouse research, which aims to clean up incomplete, \nerroneous and duplicated data, finally to solve the data \nquality issues in database or file system [14]. However, \nunlike database or file system, the unreliability of data \nproduced by IoT sensing devices, namely “dirty data”, \nmanifests itself in four general forms: False Negative, False \nPositive, Invalid and Redundancy [15]. False negative refers \nto the data loss in IoT sensing devices. The reason for this \nproblem includes interference signal between sensors and \ncomplex environment. False positive is also known as noise. \nBesides the correct data, system may also collect additional \nnoise which is not expected. It is also due to the factors of \nthe sensor itself and communication environment. This will \ncause another problem called invalid data showing the value \ndeviates from the normal range. In order to ensure the signal \ncoverage, there are usually more than one sensor covers the \nsame 


object. This policy causes the data redundancy. Data \n1145\n  \ncleaning technology in IoT has been widely studied. \nApproaches to reduce and eliminate data quality issues \ninclude stream data cleaning framework temporal granule \nand spatial granule approaches.\n1 refers to an organizational \nstructure of data cleaning approaches in different processing \nlayer and perspectives. A flexible pipeline structure to clean \nsensor data, named ESP \(Extensible Sensor stream nProcessing  Virtualize. The \nstage of Point filters the single data value for the quality \nproblem like outlier. Smooth and Merge stages are designed \nto process data respectively in temporal and spatial granule. \nLogic fault will be eliminated in stage Arbitrate and the data \nfrom multiple sources are fused in the state of Virtualize nThis framework provides an efficient and flexible \norganization of data processing. However, how to select the \nspecific temporal and spatial granule for different \napplication scenarios remain an unsolved challenge nBecause the algorithm cost and performance of different \ncleaning approaches have not been considered in ESP a \ncleaning framework for minimizing computational cost is \nproposed in [17]. This cost-conscious framework is based \non the idea of classifier which defines cleaning/error cost for \nRFID data cleaning and results in a decision tree with \nminimum cleaning cost from machine learning tests. \nAlthough these data cleaning frameworks for IoT can \norganize different algorithms effectively from different \naspects, they are based on sequential algorithm combination. \nBagging and boosting approaches in data mining can be \nintroduced into framework research for a better performance \n[18]. \n2 cleaning approach is mainly \nbased on the concept of time window smoothing which is \nfirst proposed in [19 As illustrated in Figure 3, the idea of \nthe algorithm is to output a reading at the end of a time slot \nif there exists at least one positive reading in this window. \n \nFigure 3. Fix-Sized Window Smoothing [19 nAlthough the fixed-sized window smoothing is effective \nand simple for implementation, it cannot ensure the data \ncompleteness and dynamics at the same time. To solve this \nproblem, SMURF introduces an adaptive window scheme \nby viewing data streams as a statistical sample of readings \n[20]. Many improving works on SMURF are presented in \nrapidly movement object readings cleaning [21], high \nconfidence node weighting [22] and proximity readers based \nstatistical cleaning [23]. Temporal granule approaches can \nbe mapped into the stage of Smooth in ESP framework. It \ncan clean data based on the statistical characteristics. \nAlthough SMURF and its improving algorithms achieve a \ngood balance between completeness and dynamics, \ntemporal granule approach is a low-level clean-up \nmechanism. A higher level data cleaning requires additional \nspatial and logic information to achieve better results. \n3 classified as Merge \nstage in ESP framework. Its main purpose is to clean and \naggregate data from different sources. A distributed RFID \nsystem architecture based on the inter-reader \ncommunications with secure channel is proposed in [24]. \nSimilarly, as shown in Figure 4, IoT system deployment can \nbe divided into regions Inter-region communications can \nprovide important information and supports for spatial \ngranule data cleaning approaches. \nR1\nR2\nR5\nR3\nR6\nR7\nR8\nR4\nR9\nInformation\nSharing\nSensingArea\n\nFigure 4. Distributed Model based on Inter-Region Communication [24] \nP2P Collaboration is an RFID data cleaning method \nacting like the behavior of P2P network based on the \ninter-region communication architecture [25]. Through \ninformation sharing with forward and afterward nodes, the \nsensing node can judge and correct the fault with the help of nsurrounding nodes. Similarly, TopK-PDI [26] and bSpace \n[27] removes duplications and false positive data utilizing \nthe data sharing among RFID readers. Unfortunately, this \narchitecture has a higher requirement on inter-device \ncommunication capabilities and system topology control. \n4 IoT data cleaning approaches \nand their characteristics. \nTable 1.

Extension of these studies from RFID to IoT \nsystems will have rich research opportunities for IoT data \nmanagement. \nB. Event Processing Layer \nEvent is an occurrence of interest in certain time, which \ncould be either primitive or complex event [13]. In IoT \nsystems, cleansed data can be treated as primitive events. \nAs depicted in Figure 5 that, in event processing layer, \n1146\n ncomplex semantic events are extracted from low-level \nprimitive events to support higher-level applications which \nis called Complex Event Processing \(CEP  


and provide \nservices as event detection, monitoring and response. \nPrimitiveEvents EventFiltering ComplexEventProcessing SemanticEvents  \n Figure 5. Complex Event Processing in IoT [13] \nAccording to our survey, the existing CEP models can be \nclassified into three categories: \n1 graph-based model, complex events are expressed in \ntree structure with its leaf nodes represent the primitive nevents. Once the corresponding event occurs, the occurrence \nwill be stored in the leaf node and pushed to its father node. \nIf father node successfully detects according to its operation \nsemantics, the result will be further pushed to upper node \nuntil the root detects this complex event’s happen. Snoop \n[29] is the first CEP system provides simple support of \ngraph-based time model for complex event detection in \nactive database system. READY [30] and YEAST [31] are \nother CEP systems based on the graph model. A major \ndisadvantage of these approaches is the lack of in-depth \nsupport on complex temporal event constraints. RCEDA [32] \nprovides a detailed description language on time constraints \nin complex event and proposes a concept of nnon-spontaneous event. Many events are non-spontaneous \nas they cannot detect their occurrences by themselves unless \nexpired, if associated with interval constraints [32]. RCEDA \ndefines an ECA-like description language to express \ncomplex event and uses a pseudo-event for non-spontaneous \nevent processing.  \n2 CEP Model \nIn this model, event is constructed into corresponding \nautomata, set of states and transition functions in \nautomata-based model. Complex event is successfully \ndetected if the automata reaches an accept state according to \nthe event history. In Ode database, finite state automata is \nfirstly adopted to detect complex event which is descripted \nin logic based language [33]. Cayuga [34][35] and Esper [36] \nuse automata engine to process events from data streams. \nHowever, non-spontaneous event is not supported for these napproaches. SASE is an automata-based CEP engine \nsupporting non-spontaneous event detection [37]. It nprovides a plan-based query framework to process event \nwhich includes five stages: Sequence Scan/Construction, \nSelection, Window, Negation and Transformation. \n3 model, complex event is transformed into \ncorresponding petri net in petri-net-based CEP model. Input \nplace represents the primitive event and output place \nindicates the occurrence of complex event. The input place nwill be marked when corresponding event occurs. If all the \ninput places are marked, transition will be fired. A complex \nevent is successfully detected when the model reaches the \noutput place. Petri-net-based model is first adopted by \nSAMOS [38] in active database event detection. In [39], a \nCEP middleware, PRES, is proposed which provides a \nseries of temporal constructor to describe and process the \nnon-spontaneous event n4 Classification of IoT Event Processing Approaches \n Model Language Logic Constructor \nTemporal \nConstructor Passive Event \nSnoop Graph ECA Rules or, any, etc. Provided Not Supported\nYEAST Graph \nYeast \nSpecification nLanguage\nBasic Logic Not Provided Not Supported\nRCEDA Graph ECA-Like Rules , , etc. Provided Supported nCayuga Automata Cayuga Event Language Basic Logic \nNot \nProvided Not Supported\nSASE Automata SASE Event Language Basic Logic Provided Supported \nEsper Automata EPL and, or, not, etc. Provided Not Supported\nSAMOS Petri-net ECA Rules Basic Logic Not Provided Not Supported\nPRES Petri-net PRES Event Language &, |,, etc Provided Supported \nLarge amount of data from heterogeneous sources with \ncomplex semantic is a great challenge for IoT event \nprocessing, and the lack of semantic support in the \nprocessing makes it more difficult for real world \napplications. Accurate semantic definition and information \nprocessing, however, can achieve a wide range of \nincompatibility between information systems. Meanwhile, \nsemantic support is still a missing part for existing solutions. \nOntology which is a formal specification of a shared \nconceptualization can be an important tool to construct the \nconcept and relationship between “things” in IoT [40]. We \nbelieve that ontology-based IoT semantic event processing \nis a promising research topic. \nC. Data Storage and Analysis Layer \nData exchange, storage, compress and mining for IoT \nare implemented in Data Storage and Analysis Layer. How \nto manage the heterogeneous massive real-time IoT data is a \nchallenging and key research topic. \n1 systems. Due to the presence of heterogeneous \nplatform, we need a cross-platform information exchange nlanguage for efficient communications. XML has been \napplied for Web information exchange in many systems 41]. \nAs a result, many IoT information exchange languages are \ndesigned based on XML. PML \(Physical Markup Language  description \nbetween physical environments and objects. Its supported \napplications include inventory tracking, automatic \ntransaction, supply chain management and object-to-object \ncommunications. IEEE 1451 is another important interface \nstandard for intelligent sensors and actuators [43]. \nSensorML [44] is proposed by OGC \(Open GIS Consortium processes based on IEEE 1451. \n1147\n  \nOther standards, including TML [45], EXDL [46], \nM2MXML [47] and BITX 


48] are summarized in Table 3. \nTable 3.

Semantic retrieval and processing crossing \ndomains is also hard to implement because they do not have \nthe same basic concept ontology. Therefore, defining a \nunified ontology concept and information exchange \nlanguage covering different application domains is an \nimportant future work. \n2 analyzed in Section II, large volume of data is a \nmain challenge for IoT data management. There are several nsolutions proposed to compress warehouse data in previous \nstudies. A bitmap data structure is proposed to compactly \nrepresent a collection of EPC data [49]. This data type \nutilizes a key observation that it is more efficient by \ntracking EPC data in group than individually. It is easy to \nimplement in DBMS and a series of operations are defined \nfor efficient conversion, maintenance and calculation. \nBeside the EPC data, an effective path encoding scheme \nused to encode the flow information for logistic products \nmonitoring is propose in [50]. This encode scheme is based \non the Chinese Remainder Theorem and Unique \nFactorization Theorem [51]. Time information is encoded \ninto a tree structure similar to XML region coding [52]. It \ncan retrieve tracking and path oriented queries efficiently. \nFor on-line analytical processing, the concept of RFID data \nwarehouse is introduced in [53]. The storage schema named \nRFID-Cuboids is designed based on the observation that \nRFID objects usually move in large groups and data analysis \ntakes place at different abstraction levels. The star storage \nschema is constructed centered with the fact table named \nStay and linked by other supporting tables. Although only \ntemporal and spatial dimension analysis is supported by nRFID-Cuboids, as shown in Figure 6, we can extend \nadditional data types making analysis in other dimensions npossible. The above mentioned compress and storage \nscheme are established based on the assumption that sensing \nobjects are moved in group so that the data is of high \nsimilarity. If not, the efficiency of using these storage \nschemes will be relatively low.\n\nFigure 6. Extended Storage Schema for RFID-Cuboids [53] \n3 Big Data Storage and Processing \nThe fundamental purpose of IoT is to have smart \nresponse and decision-making in domain applications based \non accurate perception and intelligent data processing. IoT \nis also one of the typical emerging domains in which data is \naccumulating in a high speed and amount. As a hot research \ntopic big data processing is one of the important parts for \nIoT data management. Big data is a large and complex data \nset or stream which is difficult to process using traditional \ndatabase management tools or processing applications [54]. \nThe fast development of sensing technology makes IoT data \nmanagement more complex especially for the large \namounts of unstructured data [55][56]. Table 4 summarizes \nand compares the characteristics of big data in IoT with \nother application domains. \nTable 4. Typical Domains of Big Data Processing \nDomain ApplicationExamples \nUser \nScale \nData \nSpeed \nData \nScale\nData \nType \nInternet of Things Sensor Data Big Fast TB Complex\nScientific Computing Bioinformatics Small Slow TB Simple \nFinancial Analysis Transactions Big Fast GB Simple \nSocial Network Web2.0 Very Big Fast PB Complex\nMobile Network Smartphone Very Big Fast TB Complex\nMultimedia Audio Video Very Big Fast PB Simple \nThere are two computational paradigms for IoT big data \nprocessing: Data Stream and Map-Reduce [57]. In data \nstream model, data arrives in stream and the processing \nalgorithm is tasked with data without explicitly storing it. \nTemporal granule data cleaning and time window event \nprocessing are data processing approaches based on data \nstream model. Typical real-time big data stream processing \nsystems which can facilitate include the Twitter Storm [58], \nYahoo's S4 59] and LinkedIn Kafka [60]. In Map-Reduce \nmodel, data is distributed in slave machines and \ncomputations are performed in the sequence of map and \nreduce operations. The cloud computing has become the \nstandard platform for big data analytics. There are many \nrelated research on data warehouse [61][62][63], distributed ndata processing [64] and data mining on the cloud \ncomputing platform [65][66]. \nD. Middleware for IoT Data Management \nMiddleware is a type of software that provides services \nto applications, enabling communications and management \nof data in distributed systems such as IoT [67]. In the report \nreleased by ISO/IEC [68], the functions of middleware for \nsensor networks include information collection, filtering, \nanalysis decision-making etc. Middleware systems for IoT \ndata management generally fall into the following categories n[69][70]: \n1 nmachines \(VMs assembly-like language. \nUser instructors are interpreted and loaded to VMs for \nexecution. Typical middleware 


solutions include Mate [71], \nSensorWare [72] and MagnetOS [73]. This model has a high \nflexibility in interface to facilitate programmers to develop \nunder heterogeneous hardware. However, it disadvantages \nin the dependency on code interpreter and a high system \noverhead. Furthermore, programming on the assembly-like nlow-level language is relatively difficult to use.\n2 declarative style of \nquerying submitted to the system and returns the result like \na database. The middleware manages the network as a \nvirtual database and the nodes as distributing data objects. \nSolutions like TinyDB 74], Cougar [75] and SINA [76] are \nimplemented in database model and they can provide the \nmanagement and optimization on nodes, data and queries. \nThis high-level abstraction guarantees the independence of \ndata processing applications with a set of simple query \ninterfaces. Nonetheless, the database model needs to nestablish and maintain an overall abstraction of distributing \nnodes and system topology. This limits the extensibility and \nloses the in-depth control on the system. \n3 message-oriented paradigm \nleveraging Publish-Subscribe mechanism allowing \nasynchronous message exchange loose coupling between \nsender and receiver. This paradigm is suitable for pervasive \nscenarios with large amount of events such as healthcare \nand financial data. Middleware systems like Mires [77], \nDSWare [78] and PSWare [79] all provide the functions of \ncomplex event composition and detection. ALE is the \napplication level events specification for communications \non the interest of event between applications and EPC data nsources [80]. There are a lot of industrial solutions based on \nthe ALE specification. Although the event-based \nmiddleware has many advantages and can be developed \nquickly, as compared with the CEP technology, the real-time \nevent detection, service reliability and information security \nissues in event-based middleware still requires further study. \n4 middleware, such as \(SI    SOA  programming and simplify the application \ndevelopment process. This model is promising as it can \nmerge and take advantages from other models such as \ndatabase and event-based approaches. The collaboration and nintegration with cloud computing, information privacy issue \nand Quality of Service \(QoS concerns for \nresearch. \n5 mobile agent based middleware. MiLAN \n[85] and TinyCubus [86] are self-adaptive middleware \nsystems which can continuously adapt the network \nconfiguration according to the feedback from applications. \nMobile agent based middleware can intelligently migrate \nand clone agents to desired locations along with network \nchanges TinyLime [87] and Agilla [88] are typical solutions \nof this model. \n6 middleware solutions for \ntheir characteristics and supported functions, especially in \nsemantic, security and QoS. As is shown in the table, \nintelligent data processing is the first concern and \nopportunity in middleware research. Related issues and \napproaches have been analyzed in Section III. Moreover, the \nQoS problem, such as how to ensure the usability of \nservices and the reliability of processing time, is another key \nresearch concern. Additionally, research on the data security \nand privacy management are still not enough.\nTable 5.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK \nIn this paper, we review the background of Internet of \nThings and analyze five distinguishing characteristics of its \ndata. We then present a layered reference model for IoT data \nmanagement. According to the model, we elaborate the \nexisted research and solutions for each layer. The research \nchallenges and opportunities are then identified and ndiscussed to promote further works on promising topics. \nData security is an important aspect that we have 


not \nanalyzed in this paper. With the relationship between devices, \ndata and users become increasingly complex, data security \nand privacy problem need to be solved urgently. It will be a \nmajor challenge for the IoT industry.  \nREFERENCES \n[1] I. Strategy and P.

The\ntool assumes that ?Vinj is performed by the apogee kick\nmotor \(AKM other ?V are performed by the\nADCS subsystem. For each of these propulsion systems, the\npropellant mass can be computed using the rocket equation:\n?Vj = gIsp,j log\nmi\nmf\n\(25 which can be\ndifferent for the AKM and the ADCS subsystem, mi is the\ninitial mass with propellant and mf is the final mass without\nthe propellant.\nAttitude Determination and Control and Propulsion Subsys-\ntem—The mass of the ADCS is mostly given by the mass\nof the sensors and the mass of the actuators.

Expressions for these distur-\nbance torques were taken from [25].\nIn addition to sensors and actuators, the ADCS has additional\nmass that can be estimated as a fix fraction of the spacecraft\ndry mass:\nmADCS = 3msen + 4mact + 0.01mdry \(28 subsystem, the mass of the AKM\ncan be estimated from its propellant mass assuming a certain\nmass fraction:\nmAKM =\n\(1 29 structure subsystem\nSubsystem k\nThermal 0.0607\nAvionics 0.0983\nStructure 0.5462\nThermal, avionics, and structure subsystems—The thermal,\navionics, and structure subystems are designed using simple\nparametrics of the form msubsystem = kmpayload.

This tool contains both a performance\nand a cost model.\nNext Steps\nThe next steps include calibration of the optical link budget\ncalculations, comparisons of the network scheduling calcula-\ntions with historical TDRSS load data, and validation of the\nspacecraft sizing algorithm with real TDRS data. Following\nthe completion of the stakeholder analysis, the tool will be\nbe used to explore the architectural tradespace and identify\na subset of preferred architectures worth studying in more\ndetail.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
