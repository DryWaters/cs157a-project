WHAT IS FAST DATA? \nThe term “Big Data” is used to refer to challenging data nmanagement problems that arise due to the high Volume, \nVelocity, Variety, and Veracity \(4Vs 1]. “Fast \ndata is the velocity part of big data” said Tony Baer and thus \ncoined the term [2]. Today, many organizations including \nsocial networks, telecommunication operators, media \nnetworks, financial institutions and governments generate \nTerabytes of data each day and attempt to insert this high \n“volume” data into databases that already contain Petabytes. \nEven worse, data is replicated by different departments for nanalysis. Data come from different sources such as sensors, \nmobile phone call data records, web/system logs which also \nresults in a wide “variety” of data to be processed and stored \n\(e.g. unstructured text semi-structured XML-JSON, \nstructured CSV, or binary audio/video data systems cannot cope with this mixed \nvariety of data very well. \nNew distributed data processing frameworks such as \nApache Hadoop [3] \(with HDFS and MapReduce e.g. HBase 1 Cassandra 2 , \nMongoDB3, etc i.e. big data batches http://hbase.apache.org/ \n2 Apache Cassandra project, http://cassandra.apache.org/ \n3 MongoDB by 10gen http://www.mongodb.org/ \nlast decade. However, they were neither designed to process \ndata in-flight or fast streaming data, nor were they designed \nfor doing interactive or looping analytical studies. Recently, \nthis deficiency is also being addressed via projects that \nwould be placed in the fast path of the enterprise data nwarehouse \(EDW 4], \nApache Drill, and Hadoop Online Prototype \(HOP taking over the \nenterprise data warehouse \(EDW variety had always been a challenge \nfor data management, its increasing “velocity” is the new \nissue of the 21st century. Attempting to store these data first \nto analyze them later creates additional costs, unwanted ndelays to actionable information, and loss of business \nopportunities. Fortunately, there are now tools to process \ndata on-the-fly as it moves from distributed sources of \ncollection \(e.g. sensors and routers selected destinations. \nSince the number of data sources and sampling frequencies \nis steadily increasing processing in-flight data in-memory is \nstill a challenge. As a result, enterprises increasingly employ \nData Stream Management Systems \(DSMS  nmining capabilities [7]. The resulting software tools are \nsometimes called Complex Event Processing \(CEP engines \nin the literature [8]. There are now distributed versions of \nthese continuous stream analysis frameworks such as Yahoo \nS44 and Twitter Storm5, in which each query plan operator is \nplaced in a separate processing engine. The benefits of using \nCEP engines for stream analytics are at least three-fold: \n• They can eliminate unwanted data early in the pipeline, \nsaving further CPU, memory, storage and energy costs.  \n n4 Yahoo \(and Apache http://incubator.apache.org/s4/ \n5 Twitter Storm, http://storm-project.net/ \n \n2013 IEEE International Congress on Big Data\n978-0-7695-5006-0/13 $26.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/BigData.Congress.2013.77\n110\n• They can turn raw data into actionable information \nquickly, thus helping businesses catch profitable nopportunities or avoid losses due to fraud or operational \ninefficiencies. \n• They can catch transient or emerging patterns, which \nnever show up in an offline data mining analysis. \nA. Motivation: Why is “online rule mining critical? \nWe are at an age, where the trends do not hold for long. \nTherefore, the temporal aspects of recommendations are \nextremely important. Unfortunately today, when the \nstreaming data volumes increase, the reaction of data \nanalysts is to increase the minimum support and confidence \nthresholds to obtain fewer rules with stronger lift \(refer to \nSection 4 for details 


nwith high lift values over a long time period \(e.g. a month period. For \nexample ice-cream, cold drinks, and plastic cups will be \nextremely popular for the hottest month of the year, just as \nsand-bags will be popular before a hurricane. However, \nthere will be no sales opportunity after the trend is gone. \nThese temporally emergent patterns occur even faster for \nonline sales or in stock markets where millions of \ntransactions occur every second. Stream rule mining can \nextract a trend such as “when stocks HPQ and MSFT go \ndown by >1%, DELL follows” within a single hour or day. \nAssume a recent trend that emerges only in a certain \ntimeframe. Its confidence value may not be the highest \nglobally but its local business value may be quite high. Our \nsuggested systems are designed to catch these rules timely \nas they occur.  \nThe rest of the paper is as follows. Section 2 describes the \nrelated work and compares them against our proposed \nmethodology. Section 3 gives an overview of the ReCEPtor \nsystem architecture. Section 4 describes the rule mining \nalgorithms. Section 4 gives performance analysis and results. \nFinally, Section 5 concludes the paper. \nII. RELATED WORK \nThe concept of “stream mining” did not exist before \n2000’s. Association Rule Mining \(ARM   designed for “offline” \nor traditional data mining. Our paper utilizes these ARM \nalgorithms, but applies them over streams by integrating \nthem with a CEP engine and testing their performance with \ndifferent sliding windows. The tools which claim “real-time \nanalytics” capabilities mostly depend on an offline rule nextraction phase \(i.e. the training i.e. the testing \nor scoring phase in trends and not just detect the \nexistence of already mined historaical rules. \nSome of the seminal work on pattern and rule mining \nover streams [11][12][13] only talk about the challenges, \nmodels and issues without any specifics of implementation. \nIssues mentioned include the need for one-pass algorithms \nand incremental updates among windows. The former issue \n\(one-pass than the stream mining algorithm can process \nand the latter issue \(incremental updates nwe want to exactly imitate the offline version of the mining  \nalgorithm. We demonstrate in this paper that neither of these \nmay be an issue for many rel-life applications. \nFrequent pattern mining [11] is not exactly the same task \nas rule mining, since finding rules requires an additional \nconfidence calculation. In this paper, we only focus on doing \nARM over streaming text log data and do not address \nprocessing of already stored \(offline image and audio/video stream mining including stream clustering and \nstream classification. These topics constitute interesting nfuture work. \nARM over streams can be regarded yet another way of \nreducing raw data size to extract useful information. Other \ndata-based techniques for reducing raw data size without \nlosing the patterns carried inside include sampling, load \nshedding, sketching, synopsis and aggregations. An \noverview of these techniques can be found in [14]. \nAggregations over streams can include basic counting and \nsummations as well as more complex mean, variance and \ncorrelation [15] calculations. StatStream [16] is among the \nfirst in literature to discuss scalable stream correlations by \nusing Discrete Fourier Transform \(DFT napproximation techniques. In our previous works, we also \napplied product-moment correlation techniques to spatio-\ntemporal data and shown that such correlations may not \nstrictly guarantee spatial locality [15,17 nIII. RECEPTOR SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE \nDSMS engines [5][6] provide effective queuing, \nscheduling, time and count-window support, and fast in-\nmemory processing of high-speed, continuous, unbounded \ndata streams. They parse, optimize and execute queries \nwritten in declarative languages such as Event Processing \nLanguage \(EPL in Esper [8]. EPL syntax and semantics are \nquite similar to that of Structured Query Language \(SQL ndatabases, but there are additional clauses such as \nWINDOWs to support sliding or tumbling window-based nanalysis over data streams. Figure 2 shows these two types of \nwindows. Sliding-time windows are used to buffer event \ntuples whose occurrence times fall within a certain time \nperiod \(e.g. last 1 minute replace events that are older \nthan the time window. The window will move or “slide” in \ntime with a period that is usually smaller than the size of the \nwindow and therefore the two event epochs overlap. \nSimilarly sliding-count windows buffer last X events.  \n \n   \nFigure 2.  Tumbling vs. Sliding Window semantics n111\nTumbling windows on the other hand jump to the next epoch \nby moving as long as the window size and there is no data \noverlap between the two event epochs. Other types of \nwindows include Landmark and Damped [9 where the \nformer considers events from a past landmark time until \npresent and the latter gives more weights to recent events.  \nEPL queries can be used for continuous filtering \(e.g. \nSELECT x,y FROM Stream<x,y,z WHERE COUNT, SUM, AVERAGE MIN, MAX aggregation functions such \nas TOP-K, DISTINCT, QUANTILES, and SKYLINE can \nalso be implemented. We slightly modified some of the open \nsource ARM algorithms and integrated them with Esper CEP \nengine. We also 


implemented new EPL clauses for these \nalgorithms so that they can be used just as easily as any other nwindow-based \(sliding or tumbling narchitecture of our data stream analytics system. High-speed \nraw data streams are first subjected to Select and Project \noperators inside the DSMS to get rid of tuples unwanted \nfurther in the data pipeline. The data volume can be reduced \nrow-wise \(Select Project the stream mining is done at this \nstage. The rest of the complex analytics and mining clauses \nare implemented inside the CEP system, which is deployed \neither as a private or public cloud system. Data from streams \ncan be correlated among each other or with data stored in \npersistent repositories such as DBMS and NoSQL systems. \nNoSQL \(“Not-only SQL processing engines \ncoupled with a declarative or procedural language for \nanalytics on top. NoSQL systems are used in support of the \nevent queues to extend the correlation windows.  \nNew CEP operators developed in this and recent previous \nwork are denoted with the butterfly sign in Figure 3: \naggregate \(correlation mining \(Apriori & FP-\nGrowth systems and visualization tools for \nfurther actions. The feedback loop shown at the CEP system \noutput denotes the registration of rules learned through \npredictive mining back into the CEP engine for faster ndescriptive processing. For example, an association rule such \nas \(A&B?C A,B>,C>. \nOver time the system will be more sensitive against complex \nevents, patterns or rules that it has seen before \(similar to \nreinforcement learning stream analytics and mining system architecture. \nIV. RULE MINING OVER STREAMS \nThis section describes implementations of popular ARM \nalgorithms, Apriori and FP-Growth, over data streams and \ntheir use for real-time rule generation. \nA. Association Rule Mining \(ARM im, in a \ndatabase D. An association rule is denoted as X?Y  \(S,C itemsets \(i.e. X ? I, \nY ? I and X ?Y calculated using Equ. \(1 2 that contain that itemset \(either X, Y, or both percentage \nof records that contain X that also contain Y.  \n\(1  nD\nYXsYXSupport ?=?\n n n n  nXs\nYXsYXConfidence ?=?\n \nIn Apriori [9], all items in the database are transformed \ninto transactions with as transaction id \(TID 1 nwith \(support < minSupport nitemsets \(i.e. all subsets itemset is \ncalculated using Equ. \(2 confidence > \nminConfidence current rules.  \nApriori algorithm - although it is among the first invented \nARM algorithm and the most famous one- is \ncomputationally costly because of its combinatorial \napproach. If the transaction count in the database is N, \nunique item count is k, the total itemset count is M=2k -1, \nand maximum transaction length is w,  then the time \ncomplexity of Apriori is O \(N.M.w  exponentially.  \n \nFigure 4.  Construction of the candidates from transactions [16]. \nFP-Growth [10] is another popular algorithm designed to \naddress the performance problems of Apriori. FP-Growth \nalso uses the minSupport and minConfidence threshold \nvalues, but  it builds the candidate set differently from \nApriori. It first orders items in the database based on \nfrequency, stores them in a sorted FrequencyList or Flist, \nand prunes the list using the minSupport threshold. It creates \na Frequent-Pattern tree or FP-tree data strructure after \npruning. The rules are extracted from the FP-tree using the \nminConfidence value. \n112\nB. Methodology Experiment Setup \nWe obtained the Java implementations of the Apriori \nand FP-Growth algorithms from the Association rule library \nof the famous machine learning tool called Weka [19] and \nintegrated these algorithms in Esper engine which is also \nJava based.  Later we integrated a second, more-efficient \nversion of FP-Growth algorithm called SPMF \(Sequential \nPattern Mining Framework nReCEPtor. One needs to implement a custom aggregation \nfunction in Esper \(AggreationSupport class noperators. We implemented this interface for each \nalgorithm. The EPL continuous query for Apriori looks like nthis: \n \n \n \nThe parameters we used to test Weka’s Apriori algorithm \ninside Esper were as follows: '-N 10 -T 0 -C 0.9 -D 0.05 -U \n1.0 -M 0.1 -S -1.0 -c -1', where N is the number of rules to \noutput for each window, T is   the metric type by which to \nrank rules \(0=confidence | 1=lift | 2=leverage | \n3=Conviction minimum metric score \(e.g. min \nconfidence = 0.9 support \(defaults = 1.0 and = 0.1 niteration \(default = 0.05 default = last dynamic streaming \nenvironments fixed manual settings could lead to either too \nmany or too few rules to be 


extracted. Therefore, we \ninitially selected to leave this U/M bounds adjustment to be \ndynamically made by the Weka system. Table.feature1 is \nthe transaction schema and Table.feature2 is the item \nschema. The EPL continuous query for FP-Growth similarly \nlooks like this: \n \n \n \nThe parameters we used to initialize Weka’s FP-Growth \nalgorithm inside Esper were as follows: '-P 2 -I -5 -N 10 -T \n0 -C 0.9 -D 0.05 -U 1.0 -M 0.7 where N, T, C, D, U/M are \nthe same as Apriori; P is the attribute index for binary \nattributes in normal dense instances \(default index 2 for \nsparse instances is used in large items sets \(and rules default = -1, i.e. no \nlimit studies use examples from the retail shopping \ndomain: “a customer who buys X and Y also buys Z”. In \nthis domain a transaction can be clearly defined by a \nshopping receipt. How about unbounded sessions such as nonline music streaming? How can we define a transaction? \nA time-based “transaction” or session in LastFM listening \ndataset is defined as the list of songs listened by each user \nduring the window of analysis. This view of session or \ntransaction is analogous to the one-time visit of a customer \nwhen he/she goes to a retail store and buys a set of items. \nJust like the same customer may visit the retail store later to \nbuy another set of items, the LastFM music user is assumed \nto listen to another set of songs if he/she has a batch of nrecords in other windows.  \nFig.5 illustrates the relations of tumbling windows of \n10K \(N=10,000 100K row count sizes with each \nother. A rule mining analysis can be done either on 10K \ntumbling windows, or 20K, etc. to represent a session. We \nactually tried even smaller windows sizes \(only 100 or \n1000 the complete workload size \(to simulate \noffline processing generate any rules and windows that are too big \nwill take too long to process similar to an offline data nmining operations. Before a window slides or tumbles to the \nnest epoch, rules that are found in the current window have \nto be published immediately. We plotted the transaction \ncounts for different window sizes in the results section \(Fig \n6 first appeared in [10K-20K] \ninterval, K1 in [30k-40k] and so on. The goal should be to \npublish these rules as early as possible, so that the required \nbusiness actions can be taken immediately.  \n \n \nFigure 5 Sessionization using tumbling windows: window sizes, their \nitem ranges and the rules founds \(K0-K3 minSupport and minConfidence values can also \naffect the rule count results for different windows sizes. We nfixed them after the first comparison of Apriori and Weka’s \nFP-Growth \(more about these in Section 5 LastFM Dataset and Preprocessing \nLastFM data contains information about ~1000 people \n\(lastfm-1K dataset 20] listening to songs in the LastFM \ndatabases. There are approximately 75,000 unique artists, a \nfew hundred thousand unique songs, and millions of \ntransactions in this ~3GB dataset from 2005-2011. Briefly nthe fields include <user-id, timestamp, artist-mbid, artist-\nname, song-mbid, song-title>. In the preprocessing phase, \nwe first cleaned the records with missing artist information \nand removed the time-song fields which did not contribute \nSELECT FPgrowth\(parameter, table.feature1, table.feat2 event.win:length\(5 parameters, table.feature1, table.feature2 event.win:length\(5 includes doing preprocessing online as well.  \nWe used count-based sliding windows. Finally, we had \ntwo features of the dataset \(<user-id, artist-mbid just for \nthat algorithm, we further trimmed the data to include users \nthat listened to more than 100 songs and songs that have \nbeen listened more than 3000 times overall. This resulted in \n967 unique users listening to 1105 unique artists. This work \nonly reports the performance studies from 5.7 million rows \nbelonging to year 2008 data, but a wider range study \nincluding 18 million rows from 2007-2008-2009 were also \ndone similar results were obtained and thus not reported answer in our experiments are \nas follows: \(1 appear in offline rule mining? \(2 results faster? \(3 4 nlearn rules \(whether local or globally valid results in \nthis section answer these questions. \nThe results given in Table I show that Weka’s FP-Growth nalgorithm integrated into Esper \(for finding Top10 rules in \n5.7M row count Weka’s \nApriori algorithm over the same data stream \(61/0.81 and \n226/0.37 previous work [12], \nsince FP-growth avoids the iterative, combinatorial \ncandidate generations calculated by Apriori. Due to its poor \nperformance, we later excluded Apriori from the online \nARM comparisons. The results for other analysis and \ncomparisons with Apriori are given in our previous related \nwork [15], therefore we skip details here. \n \nTABLE I: RESULTS OF OFFLINE ANALYSIS. \n [i:967 a:1105] [i:1105 a:967] \nApriori 61.403s 226.502s \nFPGrowth 0.811s 0.369s \n    \(i: instances, a: attributes 


unsatisfactory \nperformance in stream processing, we fixed and used \nminSupport=0.01, minConfidence=0.9 values. As described \nabove these parameters can be changed dynamically by the \nsystem when no rules our found, but we fixed them to be \nable to compare the performances and published rules of \ntwo similar FP-Growth Weka and SPMF M counts \(N, w that longer windows will have \nmore transactions \(e.g. 100K?550 e.g 10K?300 find support in larger windows. Therefore, many \nlocal rules that find support in their respective windows do nnot appear when a global analysis is conducted. The \nminThreshold values can be decreased as window sizes nincrease, but in that case the computation times will also \nincrease. Fig 6. displays the total number of rules \(unique \nvs. non-unique The numbers descrease as \nwindows sizes increase as the minSupport value was kept \nconstant. 10K windows generate 4736 rules \(3894 unique 527 unique the number of non-unique and unique \nrules found respective windows to not differe much, which \nis a strong indicator for the locality of rules.  \n \n \nFigure 6.  Transaction counts for different tumbling window sizes Y-axis X-axis counts \nfound by the analyses that use different tumbling window sizes. \nTo understand how the rules found in Fig 7. by different \ntumbling window size compare to other window sizes we \nconducted detailed set-based  measure, but we report only Jaccard in \nFig. 8 as the results were quite similar. The matrix in Fig 8. \nis symmetric as expected with a band of 1’s in the diagonals \nas it is the same set. Note that the Jaccard value drops \nsharply after this to 0.15 range for comparisons of windows \nwith 10K size difference down to  0.02 for 90K size \n114\ndifference. This finding suggests that the unique rules found \nby the 10K window analysis in Fig.7 are 89% different \n\(only 11% similar that matrices for set differences \nand set intersections for brevity. \n \n \nFigure 8.  Jaccard similarity of rules found by different window sizes. \nWe found that only two popular rules were common \namong the analysis using different window sizes. These \nrules were \(Rule1 i.e. \npeople who listen to George Harrison also listen to the \nbeatles Rule2 the guitarist of The Beatles who continued to \nsing similar songs and apparently continued to get liked by nthe Beatles fans. Similarly Hilary Duff and Britney Spears \nhave similar singing styles and do have a similar fan base. \nFig. 9 shows which rule was found in which window. Rule \n1 & 2 appear frequently in different window ids of analysis \nwith all window sizes. Rule 3 and Rule 4 are also popular, \nbut do appear in fewer many window sizes and ids. These \nrules are “Iron & Wine and Coldplay=>Radiohead” \n\(Rule3 Blackfield=>Placebo” \(Rule4 publish them without any delay. \n \nFigure 9.  Rules found by analysis in all window sizes \(1-2 npopular rules \(3-4 find the same set \nof rules, therefore the results of the analyses in Figures 6?9 \nwould be the same. But how do their performances \ncompare. We have seen before that Apriori was inapplicable \ndue to its exponential time complexity. Therefore, we \nimplemented and integrated a second, more-efficient version \nof the FP-Growth algorithm called SPMF \(Sequential \nPattern Mining Framework implementation in Weka. The results \nare given in Fig.10. All results were obtained on an IBM \nserver with Intel Xeon processors, but only a single core \nwas used. We hope to report performance results of parallel nexecution with Esper’s HA \(high availability faster \nthan Weka’s FP-Growth \(e.g. compare 10K window size implementation are \nmore stable. SPMF can vary widely, especially as window \nsizes increase to 100K.  \n \n \n\(a n \n\(b a b implementation in SPMF. \nFig. 11 shows the total time for different windows sizes \nand the results are quite critical. First of all, it shows that the \noffline rule mining operation that becomes impossible with nthousands of users and millions \(5.7M have \ndone in ReCEPtor. Note that a year’s worth of LastFM data \nwas mined in a few minutes. We see that smaller window \nsizes can be processed much faster as window sizes \ndecrease and yet lots of unique rules will still be found as \nwe have demonstrated above. SPMF is ~7x faster than \nWeka’s FP-Growth for the 10K windows but the difference \nreduces to ~2x for 90K windows and almost equals for the \n100K. The fastest analysis in Fig. 11 shows us that it is \npossible to process 5.7 Million rows in 6.42 minutes in a \nsingle core giving us 


an immense rate of ~887K rows/min \nper core or ~15K rows/sec per core. Note that this is not a \nsimple stream filtering operation, but a complex algorithmic \ncalculation. This is the rate at which we can sustain ARM nover fast streams. Many streaming applications do not \n115\ngenerate data this fast. Yet, as the support and confidence \ncalculations are embarrasingly parallel we can easily sustain \nmuch higher rates with multi-core servers. We estimate that \nwe can potentially mine rules over a fast stream of ~600K \nrows/sec using a 40 core IBM symmetric multi-processor \n\(SMP However, our performance findings here render \nthe strong assumptions about the need for “one-pass stream nmining” algorithms over fast data questionable \(whether \nthey are really needed or not Total processing times of two FP-Growth algorithms \(Weka’s \nand SPMF show the memory usage of the SPMF FP-Growth \nrule mining algorithm, which was more efficient than \nWeka’s both in time and space. First, even the largest \nmemory used \(3.17GB even laptops- today. All the stream \nprocessing is done in-memory therefore this analysis was \nrequired and useful. Larger window sizes require more \nmemory for holding the data and creating the candidate sets \nas can be expected. The increased memory usage towards \nsmallest window sizes are due to the increased number of nrules generated as shown in Fig. 7.  \n \n \nFigure 12.  Memory usage of SPMF FP-Growth algorithm for different ntumbling window sizes. \nDuring our research we discussed the use of incremental \nupdates among windows and even briefly tested the \noutcomes. However, the disadvantages were two-fold: \(1 around, thus increasing the \nmemory usage and \(2 apporach into the imitation of an offline \nrule mining  algorithm, which we did not desire.  \nVI. CONCLUSIONS nConducting on-the-fly analytics over big and fast data is \nthe newest IT challenge. In this paper, we presented \nimplementation details and performance results of \nReCEPtor, our system for “online” Association Rule \nMining \(ARM data mining. \nSpecifically, we implemented and tested Apriori and two \ndifferent FP-Growth algorithms \(from Weka and SPMF at different tumbling \nwindow sizes.  \nWe found that with online ARM we can generate many \nunique rules, with a sustained throughput up of ~15K \nrows/sec, and lowest possible latency for rule publications \n\(as they emerge nrules such as “George Harrison?Beatles” and reported \nsome of them here. We hope that our findings can shed light \non the design and implementation of other fast data \nanalytics systems in the future. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT nThis work was supported in part by European Union FP7 \nMarie Curie Program BI4MASSES Grant, Turkish National nInstitute of Science and Technology \(TUBITAK nTurkish Telecomm and Avea Labs.

stability \(standard deviation, tail percen-\ntile, PI multiple scenarios or system designs. This is an \narea in which our reporting is particularly weak. Even the formal statistical comparisons we provide typi-\ncally focus on a single measure, and nearly always compare means rather than measures of risk.  \nThis list of analytics challenges is not exhaustive, but it is a good start. We are currently giving simulation \nusers amazing tools for generating data, but not nearly as much help in getting the most out of these data.  \n7 CONCLUSIONS \nThis paper has continued the discussion of Grand Challenges in M&S by discussing these from an Opera-\ntional Research/Management Science \(OR/MS It has discussed themes including simulation \nin healthcare, value of information, data modeling, stochastic modeling and optimization, agent-based \nsimulation and simulation analytics. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThe work described in C.

introduced SALSA, an approach to automatically\nanalyze Hadoop logs to construct state-machine views of the\nplatform’s execution [25]. The derived state-machines are used\nto trace the data-flow and control-flow executions. SALSA\ncomputes the histograms of the durations of each state and uses\nthese histograms to estimate the Probability Density Functions\n\(PDFs between the PDFs across machines to detect\nanomalies. Tan et al. also compare the duration of a state\nin a particular node with its past PDF to determine if the\nduration exceeds a determined threshold and can be flagged\nas an anomaly.\nAnother related work to this paper is the approach of Xu\net al. in [26], which uses the source code to understand the\nstructure of the logs. They create features based on the constant\nand variable parts of the log messages and apply the Principal\nComponent Analysis \(PCA behaviour.\nAll the above approaches are all designed for system\nadministrators in managing their large clusters. Our approach,\non the other hand, aims to assist developers in comparing the\ndeployed system on such large clusters against the develop-\nment cloud.\nX. CONCLUSION\nDevelopers of BDA Apps typically first develop their appli-\ncation with a small sample of data in a pseudo cloud, then\ndeploy the application in a large scale cloud environment.\nHowever, the larger data and more complex environments\nlead to unexpected executions of the underlying platform.\nSuch unexpected executions and their context cannot be easily\nuncovered by traditional approaches.\nIn this paper, we propose an approach to uncover the\ndifferent behaviour of the underlying platforms for BDA Apps\nbetween runs with small testing data and large real-life data\nin a cloud environment. To evaluate our approach, we perform\na case study on Hadoop, a widely used platform, with three\nBDA Apps. The case study results show the strength of our\napproach in two aspects:\n1 drastically reduces the verification effort\nby 86-97% when verifying the deployment of BDA\nApps in the cloud.\n2 the prob-\nlematic logs reported by our approach are much fewer\nthan using keyword search, which makes it possible to\nmanually explore the problematic logs.\nIn addition, our approach provides additional context informa-\ntion \(execution sequences sequences of the logs to\nrapidly understand the cause of problematic log lines.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
