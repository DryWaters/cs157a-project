Reducing I.T. Project Management Failures A Research Proposal   Gezinus J. Hidding, Ph.D Loyola University Chicago ghiddin@luc.edu  John Nicholas, Ph.D Loyola University Chicago jnichol@luc.edu    Abstract  Failures rates of Information Technology \(I.T projects remain high, even after decades of efforts to reduce them.  However, most efforts to improve project success have focused on variations within the 
traditional project management paradigm.  We argue that a root cause of high I.T. project failure rates is the traditional paradigm itself, as promulgated by e.g., PMBOK.  Discussions with an expert panel resulted in the formulation of a new paradigm described in this paper: Value-Driven Change Leadership \(VDCL\his paper proposes empirical research to ascertain the role of the new paradigm in reducing I.T. project failure rates.  The initial phase of our research, reported in this paper, resulted in a survey questionnaire and pilot data from several I.T projects.  The paper describes the research methodology for an empirical study to investigate the 
role of VDCL in reducing I.T. project failure rates  1. Introduction In this paper we propose empirical research that aims to reduce failure rates of I.T.-intensive projects We hope that the conference reviews and discussions will further improve the proposed research.  In this paper, we first present a review of the literature about I.T. project failure rates over the past few decades We argue that the root cause of high failure rates is the traditional way of thinking about project management.  We then describe Value-Driven Change Leadership \(VDCL\, a new set of principles 
about project management formulated by an expert panel.  Finally, based upon results from a pilot phase we describe a research methodology for studying the effect of VDCL on I.T. project success or failure  2. Literature review  Various researchers have grappled with the question of what constitutes project success or failure.  We distinguish two schools of thought.  Following Drucker s t i n ction bet w ee n e f f i cien c y  doing 
things right d effectiveness doing the right things we call them the efficiency and effectiveness schools of thought.  The efficiency school of thought defines success as the project s management being successful, as evidenced by criteria such as cost and schedule performance \(see e.g., the Project Management Body of Knowledge  PMBOK  T h e ef f i ci en c y  s c h ool f o cus e s on 
activities and resources and takes an internal view of the project [33 T h e ef f ecti ven e ss s c h ool of t h oug h t  defines success as the project s outcomes being successful, as evidenced by criteria such as profits see, e.g., [1  T h e ef f ecti v e n e s s s c h ool tak es an external view of the project and focuses on outcomes and stakeholders.  Some authors argue for a combination of efficiency and effectiveness measures  i th di ff eren t m e a s u r es  appro priate at dif f e re n t  stages of the project life cycle  
2.1. Failure rates have been high for decades Researchers such as Robert Glass have chronicled various projects that failed Ov er th e pas t 15  years or so, the series of CHAOS studies by the Standish Grou a s poi n t ed t o h i g h  proj ect  failure rates.  The Standish Group reported in 2006 that 19% of I.T. projects were canceled before they were completed, and 46% were completed and operational, but were over budget, late, and/or completed with fewer features and functions than originally specified.  35% of I.T. projects were delivered on time, on budget and as specified.  \(It 
must be noted, however, that some researchers have argued that the Standish Group may have favored data from failed projects, see, e.g e cen t  research in the UK found that 9% of projects had been abandoned and that, on average, projects overshot budget by 13% and schedule by 20% and underdelivered on scope by 7%.  Of course, project termination does not necessarily equal project failure Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 1 978-0-7695-3450-3/09 $25.00 © 2009 IEEE 


Certain projects may incur less losses by terminating rather than continuing, and If you don t try some risky projects, you ll lose your competitive edge 6 I.T. project failure rates have been found to depend on project size as measured, e.g., in personmonths [39 o r i n func t i o n p o i nt s 1 7    T h e l a r g e r t h e  project size, the larger the probability of failure Concern about \(high\ project failure rates has been raised not just for the past 15 years, but for at least 40 years.  In the late 1980 s, research in the U.S.A. found that 16.5% of software projects rarely or never have cost overruns while fully 41 always or usually do with cost overruns averaging 33% [31 th e earl y 1980 s, research in the U.S.A found that among I.S. development projects the median cost overrun was 33.5%, the median overrun in person-days was 36%, and the average schedule overrun was 22 T h a t s a m e res e arc h f o u n d  that 17.5% of software projects are rarely or never delivered late, while 32.9% are always or usually late In the 1970 s, Hank Lucas wrote his Ph.D dissertation on Why Information Systems Fail    In 1968, NATO sponsored a conference that coined the term Software Engineering The conference included discussions about software crisis and software failure noting that it is large systems that are encountering great difficulties  s reported in e of th e conferen ce participan ts J Licklider, had reported that at one time, at least two or three dozen complex electronic systems for command, control and/or intelligence operations were being planned by the military.  Most were never completed.  None was completed on time or within budget The fact that some of these references date back so many years supports the notion that I.T project failure rates have been high for decades despite efforts to reduce them during that time Failure rates appear to fall into two categories One category is concerned with project activities how much the project schedule and costs were over or under the original estimates.  The other category is concerned with the project s end product Was it completed at all, how much/well it is used, and how well did it correspond to the original requirements Either category of project failures have been a concern for decades despite numerous attempts to reduce them 2.2. Failure factors and success factors During the past several decades, numerous studies have been conducted to determine the influence of various factors on I.T. project success and/or failure Several factors were found to contribute to project success, including clearly defined goals, executive support, project leadership, scope management planning, project organization, communication with stakeholders, skilled personnel, user involvement risk management, tools, timely progress feedback adaptability to unex pected events.  See, for example  34  27 4 9 Oth e r f a ctors  w e re f o u n d to contribute to project failure, e.g., lack of general agreement on project goals, use of an inappropriate software development methodology, dissimilarity to previous projects, requirements volatility, and inadequate technology base or infrastructu   So m e  f actors co n t ribute to proj ect s u cces s or failure dependent on their presence or absence, e.g clearly established success criteria, goal commitment of the project team, adequate project team capability   A number of these factors and associated management techniques have been part of the traditional way of thinking about project management, as promulgated, e.g., in PMBOK PMBOK focuses on activities and resources and focuses on on-time and on-budget completion of project activities.  Related success factors include scope management, detailed planning, and risk management.  Critical Chain [16  a r e l a t e d m e t h o d   focuses on bottlenecks in critical resources PRINCE h ic h f o c u ses  m o re produ ctb as ed  planning with a Product Breakdown Structure \(PBS also has a significant overlap with PMBOK Additional success- or failure factors stem from other ways of thinking about project management At least six different perspectives on project management have been recognized [20   w i t h t h e t a sk  perspective dominating PMBOK.  The other perspectives are the leadership perspective \(team effectiveness, leadership styles\, the system perspective \(e.g., inadequate technology base or infrastructure\takeholder perspective \(e.g agreement regarding project goals\saction cost perspective \(e.g., goal commitment of the project team\d the business-by-project perspective \(e.g focus on project results 2.3. Project management paradigms To improve project management practices managers can engage in single-loop learning and/or double-loop learning n single-loop learning they attempt to correct failures merely by changing actions but not changing their way of thinking about project management.  For example, they pay more attention to activities on the project s critical path.  In double-loop learning, managers attempt to correct failures by first examining and altering the governing variables and then the actions  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 2 


9\.  That is, the managers first question the relevancy of their existing way of thinking.  For example, rather than focusing on activities on the critical path, they focus on the project s intended business results Improving project management practices based on success- and failure factors that are consistent with PMBOK requires single-loop learning Improving project management practices based on other factors that do not fall into the traditional paradigm requires double-loop learning.  However neither seems to have reduced the high rate of project failures.  We conclude that, in order to reduce failure rates, there is a need to develop and test yet other project management paradigms.  This is what we set out to do in our research program, on which this paper reports 3. Value Driven Change Leadership To develop a new way of thinking about project management, we convened a series of meetings with a group of 20 experienced I.T.-project managers These resulted in a set of fundamental principles for project management that we call Value-Driven Change Leadership VDCL\.  This paper describes VDCL as well as the proposed methodology for empirically testing the extent to which VDCL influences project failure rates 3.1. Expert panel The group of experienced I.T.-project managers consisted of 17 men and 3 women, whose length of experience managing I.T. projects ranged from 10 to 40 years \(average 20 years\.  Most have extensive experience in I.T. consulting across a wide variety of industries We were interested in finding out how these experienced I.T. project managers think about project management in ways that differ from PMBOK.  Over the period of a year, the group met several times and reviewed, ranked and refined a list of factors of project management perspective other than the task perspective.  The result was a set of fundamental principles that the members agreed reflect how they think about project management.  We call the set of principles Value-Driven Change Leadership \(VDCL While the group s experience is in the management of projects within I.T and the principles are aimed particularly at I.T projects, we believe that VDCL may well be applicable to project management in other domains as well.  That however, is a topic beyond the scope of this paper 3.2. Projects, portfolios, programs and strategies It is important to note that VDCL is a framework for thinking about the management of projects  whether done individually or in the context of a program and/or portfolio of projects.  In recent years there has been growing attention on the management of programs and project portfolios directed at achieving broad, long-range, strategic business objectives, as evidenced by the growth of PMOs and project governance boards in business organizations While VDCL principles may overlap with methods of program management and portfolio management they focus on project management 3.3. Fundamental principles VDCL consists of nine fundamental principles organized into three overlapping themes.  The three themes are value-added over budget/schedule  business solution over architecture framework and human change over repeated activities We have adopted this x over y formulation of these themes from the Agile Manifesto \(agilemanifesto.org\ to emphasize new ways of thinking while not discarding existing ways.  The VDCL themes and the fundamental principles are described next  3.3.1. Value-added over budget/schedule  According to traditional project management metrics a project that is completed ahead of schedule and under budget is a success.  However, if a project s costs exceed the benefits, executive management may well consider it a failure.  Also, according to traditional project management metrics, a project that is completed behind schedule and over budget might be labeled as a failure.  However, if a project s benefits exceed the costs, executive management may well consider it a success.  As one of the members of the expert panel remarked Firms invest in I.T. to create value, not software Given VDCL s emphasis on I.T. \(projects\g value to an organization, one I.T. executive we know said There are only business projects, some have more I.T. than others  Delivering benefits and managing value to the customer have been recognized as important activities for project leaders, see, e.g     46 ev en acros s di f f e ren t s t a k eh olders 21  Consistent with such views, the expert panel views the project manager as responsible for the business results obtained from the projects, which is an intrapreneurship view of project management, as advocated in c cord in g  to VDCL  proj ect  leaders must balance not only project cost and Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 3 


schedule \(efficiency\t also project results both tangible, such as financial return, and intangible, such as company image \(effectiveness\, s    Three principles address the theme of valueadded.  For purposes of this study we define valueadded as the net change in financial results  due to the organization s and/or third-party stakeholders  adoption of the project s end product \(for example employees, customers, or business partners making productive use of a new I.T. system\hile we acknowledge that projects often provide intangible results such as second order effects, our focus is on business results that are quantifiable and measurable Our panel believes that more executives and project managers should demand that project outcomes be quantified.  For example, the value of compliance  may be quantified by the cost savings of noncompliance Opportunity expansion may be quantified using option valuation.  As one panel member put it If a project is expected to generate largely intangible results, I will provide largely intangible investments  The first principle, which we label V1, is measuring business results over measuring process conformance To measure business results, the expert panel found it important that all key stakeholders understand and agree on what the project s value-added and outcomes should be, and that they agree on clear success metrics Furthermore, everybody working in the project \(team members, subcontractors, etc.\hould also understand and agree with the value-added and outcomes and related success metrics.  In order to align incentives towards those metrics, project participants should have a personal stake in the success or failure of the project The second principle \(V2\ is managing the business case over abandoning the business case  Before they start, many projects are approved on the basis of a business case.  Nonetheless, the expert panel felt that projects are often managed on the basis of budget and schedule, but not on the basis of the business case.  In effect, the business case is often abandoned after the project is approved.  The expert panel felt that the business case should guide the project not only before it starts \(to clarify success metrics, evaluate project alternatives\t also during its execution \(to evaluate change requests and tradeoff decisions\d after the end-product has been delivered \(to analyze actual business results\.  At the same time, the panel was not optimistic about many firms desire or ability to keep track of their projects  business results.  Such non-tracking hinders learning what the impact of a project was on business results which in turn may perpetuate project failures into the future The third principle \(V3 quantifying the financial impact of risks over identifying a list of risks The expert panel felt that qualitative and quantitative risk analysis as described by PMBOK are not sufficient and that risks should also be analyzed as to their impact on the long-range financial results of the projects  3.3.2. Business solution over architecture framework The expert panel felt that all too often I.T. projects, particularly medium-sized ones disregard an explicit architecture of the end product thereby contributing to the rate of project failures Architecture is important for project management because it impacts all nine knowledge areas in PMBOK \(e.g., scope management and integration management\.  Although project managers do not need to be architects themselves, they do need to ensure that architecture of the end product gets adequate explicit attention in the project and is reflected in the project plan f ter all, i n t h e  words of one panel member Ignoring the architecture of a system is rather like ignoring the core of a skyscraper.  Skyscrapers are not built wall by wall, but floor by floor, around the core We define architecture as a representation or description of the structure of the specific end product, which includes 1\ the configuration of modules \(of the system\hat perform important functions that are common within the end-product: by common we mean functions that are needed frequently by endusers and/or by other functions, or functions that are similar in functionality.  2\he relations Input/Output and Control\ong the modules. 3 The specific syntax of the interfaces to the modules i.e., the specification of how modules should be accessed or invoked.  This view advocates systems thinking as the basis for project management is important to note that by architecture we do not mean infrastructure.  Infrastructure \(e.g., .NET\ a super system that offers functionalities that can be used by the project s end product Three principles address the theme of architecture.  The first \(A1 designing business solutions over debating generic frameworks In the view of the expert panel, some projects address architecture by debating generic technology frameworks \(e.g., SOA, Zachman, or .NET\  Instead the focus should be on a specific solution designed for specific business goals \(as addressed in the value theme\with a specific structure The second principle \(A2 releasing frequently over releasing with one big bang While PMBOK Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 4 


neither requires nor explicitly suggests multiple releases of the end product, other approaches such as Agile Developmen d S C R U M [43] do T h es e latter approaches essentially assume that all releases of a system are based upon a stable architecture.  The VDCL panel argued that a first release should establish the architecture for all subsequent releases i.e., the first release builds on an existing architecture or delivers a new architecture.  Each release delivers incremental business benefits by addressing the highest \(remaining\ priorities and risks, business as well as technical risks Each architecture will have advantages and disadvantages and different risks associated with it Consequently, an important principle flexible architecture A3\ that alternative architectures be developed before the project starts and possibly built into the end product, see, e.g   3.3.3. Human change over repeated activities By definition, a project is about something new Introducing something new into an organization causes organizational change.  In other words organizational change is inherent in projects and should be a part of project management.  What is organizational change all about?  To paraphrase the mantra of President Clinton s presidential campaign It s the people, stupid It is about human change Three principles address the theme of human change.  The first \(L1 changing organizations over delivering products Simply delivering an end product is not sufficient:  the organization must be prepared to adopt the new end-product for effective use.  Organizational change may involve changes in jobs, workflows, organizational structures responsibilities, collaboration with others, required skills and the like.  Preparing the organization for organization change requires executive support, ongoing communication, training, managing opposition tying recognition and rewards to the project s valueadded, and so on  The second principle \(L2 improving activities over repeating activities When projects continue to fail over time, that suggests a failure to learn from failures n s t ead o f repe ating t h e s a m e proj ect  activities, they must be replaced or improved over time.  The expert panel argued that in any project time must be taken to learn from previous projects contemporaneous projects and the project itself Project team members must take time to evaluate project activities, learn from other projects, and explore new ideas for improvement The third principle \(L3\s developing human relations over interchanging resources The expert panel argued that people \(inside or outside a project should not be viewed as interchangeable resources Instead, they should be viewed as a whole person  with unique skills and experiences, personal as well as professional.  Project activities get done on the basis of trust and common ground s t ead of negotiating differences, this principle advocates agree-to-agree i.e., find items on which there is agreement and start working on those.  Over time trust and fruitful human relations develop that enable things to get done 3.4. Different from traditional paradigm If the traditional paradigm as represented by PMBOK can be characterized as managing activities towards on-time/ on-budget based on the PERT chart of tasks then VDCL can be characterized as changing people towards adding value based on the architecture of the end-product  We believe that the VDCL paradigm is applicable for projects that construct end products and that also make design decisions that positively affect the project s value-added.  In traditional construction projects, e.g., of submarines or buildings, the end products are constructed from detailed blueprints that are largely completed before construction begins During construction, builders can make only minor design changes.  In I.T.-intensive projects, however detailed designs may not exist, and during system construction, programmers and analysts make many design decisions, including about key functionalities of the end products.  As noted by a reviewer, this raises the issue of what the scope of the project is In the view of our expert panel, VDCL principles apply from the phases of project approval, planning and definition, i.e., before design, all the way through project justification after installation.  The panel experts view delivery of business results as the overarching objective of the project, and consider anything that significantly affects the business results to be in scope  4. Research hypothesis Our research is aimed at testing the extent to which adherence to VDCL principles influences project success.  We recognize that traditional methods of project management also intend to increase project success, although they are largely concerned with schedules and budgets, i.e., with project efficiency However, as noted, a project that is completed under budget and ahead of schedule is not necessarily a success, and a project that is completed over budget and/or behind schedule is not necessarily a failure.  Success also depends on the Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 5 


extent to which project outcomes meet end-item requirements and satisfy customer needs, i.e., on the end-item s effectiveness In our view, traditional methods of project management are necessary but not sufficient for project success.  We intend to test whether VDCL s nine principles are both necessary and sufficient for project success either alone or in combination with PMBOK s nine knowledge areas We hypothesize that each VDCL principle contributes to greater project success.  That is, we view each of the principles as an independent variable and project success as the dependent variable.  Details about the variables are described later In statistical terms, the hypotheses are For principle i = 1 9 H 0i Principle i has no impa ct on project success H 1i Principle i has an impa ct on project success  That impact may be positive or negative There can, of course, be interaction effects: The combination of two or more VDCL principles may impact project success more \(or less\ than any one alone.  We recognize that besides VDCL principles other factors also affect project success; these include traditional management methods as advocated by PMBOK, as well as characteristics of the project e.g., size, complexity, technology, experience of the project manager, etc.  To be sure, this paper describes empirical research still to be done and, informed by a pilot phase, proposes a research methodology 5. Research methodology  To test our hypotheses we intend to formulate a structural equation model \(SEM\r SEM will contain only formative constructs, defined as such according to the four decision rules given in o r  determining whether a construct is reflective or formative.  \(In fact, one of the examples offered in  o r th e con s tr u ct operational excellence is similar to our dependent variable, project success The four rules are: 1\dividual measure items in the survey instrument define a construct; thus, any change in the item would cause a change in the construct.  2\hen multiple measure items are used to define a single construct, each aims at measuring a particular, unique feature of the construct.  Thus, the items are not interchangeable and none of them can be dropped.  3\   Since the individual measure items of a single construct tap different, unique aspects of the construct, they ordinarily should not covary with each other.  4\  Different measures of the same construct do not necessarily have the same antecedents or consequences.  To illustrate, consider the application of these decision rules to the first VDCL theme Value/outcome over budget schedule 1\ Three items \(principles V1, V2, and V3 define the construct \(the Value theme Causality is directed from the items to the construct The more that V1, V2 and V3 are true on a given project, the higher the project ranks on the Value theme. 2\he principles V1, V2, and V3 are not interchangeable. Each item is orthogonal: Each of the principles \(e.g., V3, quantification of risk\ents a separate aspect of the Value theme, and to drop any of them would alter the meaning of the Value construct. 3\he items V1, V2, and V3 might covary, although they do not have to, and there are no apparent reasons why they should. 4\ of principles V1, V2, V3 may have different antecedents and consequences.  For example, stakeholders agreeing on measures of value \(V1\ different from quantifying the financial impact of risks \(V3 Content validity in models with formative constructs can be performed by experts an d in  our research the panel of experts validated the constructs for both the dependent variable \(project success\nd the independent variables \(the VDCL themes and principles We will collect empirical data about projects that were completed some time ago.  We chose to do this since it would provide evidence of each project s financial outcomes \(our measure of success\, whereas data from projects not yet completed would not 5.1. Independent variables In our research design, project success is influenced by the extent to which the VDCL fundamental principles and the PMBOK knowledge areas were applied during the project; i.e., the independent variables are the VDCL principles and the PMBOK knowledge areas.  Project success may also be influenced by project characteristics such as the duration and size of the project, experience of the project manager, etc.  In our research design, these are control variables We model each VDCL fundamental principle and each of the three VDCL themes Value  Architecture  Change as an independent variable, the latter to enable statistical analysis with coarser variables As argued above, traditional project management techniques as described in the nine PMBOK knowledge areas \(time management, cost management, scope management, etc.\ likely also influence project success.  In our model, each knowledge area will also be an independent variable Besides knowledge areas, PMBOK describes 44 project management processes \(activity sequencing Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 


activity resource estimating, cost control, etc an average of five processes per knowledge area. We decided not to model these processes as independent variables since doing so would greatly increase the size of the survey instrument and, we feared, perhaps significantly reduce the response rate 5.2. Dependent variable As argued above, we believe that project leaders must focus not only on project cost and schedule efficiency\t also on tangible project results such as financial return and intangible results such as company image \(effectiveness\rposes of this study, we plan to use Net Present Value \(NPV\ the project s net cash flows as the dependent variable  W e w ill adopt as th e ti m e f r a m e f o r calcu lati ng NPV the period during which the project was expected to deliver the business results.  In practice we expect periods of three to five years.  For longer timeframes, the net cash flows of later years would probably be discounted to nearly zero.  To make projects comparable, we will normalize NPV as a percentage of the project s expenditures.  NPV expresses net cash flows the difference between incremental\h receipts and expenditures adjusted for the time value of money by dividing by an appropriate discount rate.  We acknowledge that for some projects, e.g., I.T. infrastructure upgrades the option value, not NPV, is the correct success measur ten d to addres s s u c h proj ects in  future research.  We also acknowledge a point raised by one reviewer, namely, that a firm may not have kept track of NPV or its constituent measures.  \(We note that the absence of such measures may contribute to subsequent project failures.\ during our pilot phase these issues prove predominant or too burdensome, we will consider modifying our dependent variable  5.3. Project-related characteristics Since a project s success is likely to be influenced not only by VDCL principles and PMBOK knowledge areas, but also by various characteristics associated with the project itself, we plan to collect data about characteristics of the project, the project manager, and the organization for which the project is performed Project characteristics include three measures that usually appear in the project s original business case or similar project justification at the start of the project: expected project duration \(elapsed time expected project total expenditures \(in $US\d expected incremental benefits \(cash receipts about the industry in which the project was performed includes the business function\(s\ or process\(es\at the project addressed, and whether the project manager reported to I.T. or a business function.  Data about characteristics of the project manager includes age, gender, number of years of project management experience, PMP and/or other certifications, highest degree obtained, etc.  Data on characteristics of the organization for which the project is performed includes the organization s age and revenues, the industry or industries in which it operates, and whether it is for-profit \(publicly-traded or privately-held\not-for-profit, or governmental Our statistical analyses will control for these projectrelated characteristics 5.4. Survey questionnaire Data for the independent and dependent variables and project characteristics will be collected via a survey questionnaire.  Our intention is to represent each independent variable VDCL principle and PMBOK knowledge area by one statement in the questionnaire.  \(The Appendix to this paper shows various statements that represent the VDCL principles.  The pilot phase will enable us to select the best statement for each principle.\espondents will rate the extent to which they adhere to that principle/knowledge area using a 5-point ordinal Likert scale of increasing maturity levels, per CMMI  e revie w er s u g g e sted w e  u s e  m u ltiple  statements to represent each independent variable e.g., three statements per variable.  However, we fear that doing so would make  the number of statements too large \(more than 100\nd, as a result, greatly reduce the response rate.  We note that with only one statement per variable, the level of granularity of statements in our questionnaire will be similar to that of other well-known research studies, e.g 40   The dependent variable, project success, is comprised of several variables cash receipts expenditures, and project duration combined into a single ratio-scaled variable: NPV as a percentage of total project expenditures Many control variables are ordinal and ratioscaled variables, e.g., PMBOK certification \(Yes or No\el of project risk \(Very Low to Very High number of years of experience, and so on 5.5. Sample selection and subjects For our sample we will survey completed medium-sized I.T.-intensive projects for which a business case or similar justification was approved before the project started.  We will not survey Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 


projects for which the original justification was primarily the project s option value and/or its intangible results.  We define medium-sized projects as having a duration \(elapsed time\ between one month and one year, with a peak number of project personnel between three and 50 I.T.-intensive  means that Information Technology was a substantial part of the project s end product We plan to contact various companies in the Chicago area and ask each company to identify one or more pairs of I.T. intensive projects, each pair with one project that was successful and one that was a failure, in the opinion of executives at the company In this way, we expect to keep the sample unbiased as to success or failure, and also expect the dataset to contain considerable variability in the values of the dependent variable.  At same time, within each pair we expect less variability in the values of uncontrollable variables, such as, company culture industry, etc For each project, questionnaires will be filled out by multiple respondents, e.g., the project manager the business executive who was accountable for the project, team members, etc.  This will provide a 360degree view of the project, see  5.6. Statistical Analysis As explained earlier, our structural equation model \(SEM\tains only formative constructs For such a model the statistical analysis is components-based rather than covariance-bas   Accordingly, we intend to apply the method of partial least squares \(PLS\d use SmartPLS software version   6. Preliminary results To date we have pilot tested the questionnaire with managers on four projects.  We met with each project s manager, gave the manager a copy of the questionnaire, and asked for a verbal answer to each and every statement.  Typically, the project manager would summarize various things that had or had not been done in the project, which enabled us to determine whether or not he correctly understood the question.  If he did not, we clarified the question during the interview and modified the wording before the next interview.  Finally, and occasionally with prompting from our side, the manager summarized the answer as a numerical value on the Likert scale As it turned out, most of the questions were understood correctly without requiring clarification although a few had to be rephrased.  We will continue to gather data from more projects until we are satisfied that further changes to the questionnaire are not necessary to improve the respondents  comprehension of the questions 7. Conclusions Clearly, a pilot sample size of four cases is too small to draw conclusions regarding a hypothesis Yet, even within such a small sample, however, we observed considerable variability in the responses to most questions.  This leaves us hopeful that statistical analyses will reveal effects of certain variables on project success Our analysis may result in a number of possible conclusions.  Whatever the results, they will be interesting.  If VDCL principles significantly improve the chance of project success, then adhering to them will lead to fewer project failures.  If VDCL principles do not affect project success, then that would suggest that a seemingly reasonable framework about how to manage projects originated and validated by seasoned I.T. project management experts makes no difference, and that therefore, project success must rely on something else.  Similar conclusions may emerge concerning the nine PMBOK knowledge areas 7.1. Implications for practitioners The implications of our intended research results are important, regardless of the eventual conclusions If certain VDCL principles have a significant effect on project success, project managers may want to adopt management practices related to such principles.  If certain VDCL principles do not affect project success, then \(despite the endorsement of seasoned I.T. project management experts\ project managers may want to disregard them.

It describes our conceptual thinking based on a literature review, our research methodology, and our pilot testing \(ongoing at the time of the writing of this paper Consequently, there are no results from our empirical research yet.

negative signs implying that a greater percentage of positive critical reviews led to lower box office revenues, and conversely, all CRCON had positive signs. This implies that the preferences of critical reviewers on movies are generally far from that of normal moviegoers  Table 5.

Weekly Box Office Revenue for Different Category of Movies  The model \(1 movies and non-mainstream movies to determine the different effects of attributes on mainstream movies and non-mainstream movies. Table 6 shows the regression result on mainstream movies and nonmainstream movies. Except for the first week of mainstream movies, all 11 models were statistically significant. Mainstream movies have many sources from which people can get information, and usually have more marketing budget in terms of advertisement or star casting. Model \(1 critical reviews, and competition factors for its independent variables. Therefore, the insignificant result of the mainstream movies? first week is understandable. From now, discussion will ignore the results for the first week of mainstream movies The volume of WOM has significant positive effects both on mainstream movies and non-mainstream movies, but the valence does not. While there were some weeks in non-mainstream movies where the result was significant, it is barely possible to determine that there are consistent differences between two categories of movies. Thus, H5a is rejected. There could be several reasons for this: First of all, when people read or write about movies and their personal thoughts, which then become WOM, they are less likely to know whether the movies are mainstream or non-mainstream. The Internet, especially the NAVER Movie portal, provides almost identical quality or format of information regardless of the movie type This may give people the same opportunity to be involved in WOM of two different categories of movies. Second, similar to mainstream movies, nonmainstream movies also have many other sources from which consumers can get information. If consumers can get information from other channels, there would be a greater likelihood that consumers rely on other information channels, thereby weakening the influence of valence of WOM. It would explain the insignificance of the valence of WOM for both 


insignificance of the valence of WOM for both mainstream and non-mainstream movies The result for critical reviews was not clear. Both the number and attitude of critical reviews were not significant, and some of them had unexpected signs similar to the result of model \(1 analysis, it was also seen that the positive critical reviews gave negative effect on box office revenue Here, the percentage of positive critical reviews was never significant for non-mainstream movies, but negative critical reviews were significant for three weeks in mainstream movies. This means that consumers likely do not usually watch mainstream movies that critical reviewers gave positive ratings However this does not hold true for non-mainstream movies. The result implies that the gap between the preferences of critics and normal moviegoers is bigger in mainstream movies. In that sense, H6a is supported  4.4. Aggregate Box Office Revenue  The estimated model for aggregate box office revenue is  2 a3NEGPERio +a4LNCRITICi + a5CRPROi a6CRCONi + ?i  where i for each movies \(i=1,2, ?,118 variable is the aggregate box office revenues for the entire lifespan of movies \(not just for six weeks WOM data used in this model was only prerelease data LNMSG0, POSPER0, NEGPER0 critical reviews were added \(LNCRITIC, CRPRO CRCON with some changes. The model was applied separately to overall movies data, only mainstream movies data and non-mainstream movies data. Table 7 shows the regression result on aggregate box office revenue The volume of prerelease WOM is positively significant for all three categories. That means the amount of WOM before the release of movies may give influence on the success of movies. The effect was highest in mainstream movies. However, the valence of prerelease WOM was not significant for all categories Even though non-mainstream movies had expected signs for the percentage of positive and negative WOM, the results were not significant. Thus, H5b is rejected There were differences in the impact of critical reviews on mainstream and non-mainstream movies While the number of critics and the percentage of negative critics were significant in non-mainstream movies, there was no relationship between mainstream movies and critical reviews. In the case of WOM, there were no differences between two categories of movies because it is likely that there are many other informational sources for both. The case of critical reviews, however, was a bit different. Due to the fact that consumers can get critical reviews only from online and offline movie magazines or movie sections of some portals, there are not many sources for critical reviews of non-mainstream movies. Moreover, the accessibility of critical reviews is less than WOM. This means consumers need to put more effort into read critical reviews of non-mainstream movies, and there would be a greater likelihood of consumers gets influenced.

South Korean versus American market  In terms of the effect of WOM, we find no discernable difference in the motion picture markets of South Korea and the United States. Volume of WOM is positively correlated to the following week?s revenue in both markets, and valence of WOM is not significant The effect of critical reviews, however, did not concur While the literature on the American market data reports that positive critical reviews are positively related to box office revenue[21, 34], the results on the Korean market was different. There could be several reasons for this. First, South Korea and the United States have different sources for critical reviews, and the sources may have different impacts on moviegoers Second, the characteristics of critics might be different i.e., Korean critics may prefer movies that are considered less commercial or artistic than American critics  5. Conclusion  WOM and critical reviews both are important attributes that influence box office revenue in the motion picture industry. In this study, six hypotheses related to this issue were set up and tested. Data was collected on the motion picture industry of South Korea by using several websites that provide content and statistical data about movies. Finally, data on 118 movies was collected and the movies were categorized into two groups based on the distributors of the movies If the distributor of a movie was one of the major distributors in South Korea, that movie was categorized into mainstream movies, and if not then the movie was categorized into non-mainstream movies. As expected mainstream movies had much higher box office revenue and volume of WOM than non-mainstream Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews 


movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews however, there was no big difference between mainstream and non-mainstream movies. WOM and critical reviews were usually positive H1 and H2 tested the relationship between WOM and weekly box office revenue, and the results supported the hypotheses. The volume of WOM was positively related to weekly box office revenue, while the valence of WOM had no significant effect. H3 H4a, and H4b tested the impact of critical reviews, and the results also supported the hypotheses except H4b The volume and valence of critical reviews had no consistent significances to weekly box office revenue H3 H4b. Table 7 showed that the number of critical reviews was statistically significant to aggregate box office revenue \(H4a for the attitude of critical reviews \(H4b the result more detail, an additional test was performed using only those factors related to critical reviews as independent variables. The result of the additional test supported H4, but the signs were reversed, i.e. positive critical reviews had minus signs, and negative critical reviews had plus signs. This reversed signs imply that the preference of critical reviewers is very similar to that of normal moviegoers. H5s and H6s tested the different effects of WOM and critical reviews on mainstream and non-mainstream movies. The result failed to determine that WOM give different impact on mainstream and non-mainstream movies, so H5a and H5b were rejected. H6, however, was supported, i.e the effects of critical reviews were different for mainstream and non-mainstream movies. There were no significant relationships between critical reviews and aggregate box office revenue in mainstream movies. For non-mainstream movies, however, the volume of critical reviews and the percentage of negative critical reviews were significant. Nonmainstream movies have fewer sources from which consumers can get information, and this might explain the results The above findings lead to several managerial implications. First, producers and distributors of movies could forecast weekly box office revenue by looking at previous weeks? volume of WOM. It does not matter what attitude people have when they spread WOM, the important factor is its volume. Therefore producers and distributors need to develop an appropriate strategy to manage WOM for their movies For example, the terms related to WOM marketing such as buzz and viral marketing are easily found Second, for the distributors who usually distribute less commercial and more artistic movies, and consequently have a smaller market compared to the major distributors, critical reviews can impact their movies box office revenues in a significant way. There are usually fewer sources for information for nonmainstream movies than mainstream movies, and so small efforts could leverage the outcomes. Finally, for those who are dealing with mainstream movies, the finding that the valence of WOM and critical reviews do not have significant relationship with box office revenue can have certain implications. Particularly, the attitude of critical reviews showed reversed effects Therefore, they may need to concentrate on other features rather than attitude of moviegoers or critical reviews, such as encouraging moviegoers to spread WOM This study contributes to the understanding of the motion picture industry, especially the relationship between box office revenue and WOM including critical reviews. There are existing studies that already 


critical reviews. There are existing studies that already dealt with similar issues, but this study has some differentiated features compare to prior studies. First the data used in this study was collected from South Korea, while most of the relevant studies usually focus on the North American market. This helps to provide the opportunity to understand the international market especially the Asian market, even though South Korea is a small part of it in terms of the motion picture industry. Second, movies were categorized to two groups, i.e. mainstream and non-mainstream and this study attempted to determine how WOM impacts these categories differently by testing several hypotheses In this study, there are also several limitations that could be dealt with in future research. First, using box office revenue as a dependent variable is more meaningful for distributers rather than producers. Due to there is close correlation between box office revenue and number of screens, one of producers? main concerns is how many screens their movies can be played on. Moreover, DVD sales are also important measurement for success of movies these days, and so it also could be a dependent variable. Therefore, it could be possible to give more fruitful managerial implications to various players in the motion picture industry by taking some other dependent variables Second, in this study, movies were categorized simply as mainstream and non-mainstream movies, but there could be further studies with diverse techniques of movie categorizations. For example, it would be possible to study the varying influence of WOM or critical reviews on different genres or movie budgets Third, an interesting finding of this study is that positive critical reviews could have negative relationship with box office revenue while negative critical reviews could have positive relationship. This study tried to provide a reasonable discussion on the issue, but more studies could be elaborate on it  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 References  1] Dellarocas, C., The Digitization of Word of Mouth Promise and Challenges of Online Feedback Mechanisms Management Science, 2003. 49\(10 2] Bone, P.F., Word-of-mouth effects on short-term and long-term product judgments.
