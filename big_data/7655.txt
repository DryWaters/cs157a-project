A Simple Algorithm for l, d Motif Search 1   Dolly Sharma, Sanguthevar Rajasekaran 247   Computer Science & Engineering, Universi ty of Connecticut, Storrs \226 06269, CT, USA  247 Corresponding Author   Abstract Extracting meaningful patterns from voluminous amount of biological 
data is a very big challenge. Motifs are biological patterns of great interest to biologists. There are different versions of the Motif Finding Problem. In this paper we concentrate on the Planted l, d f Search Problem. There have been numerous algorithms designed to solve this problem. Many instances of the Planted l d f Problem have been identified as challenging instances. The algorithm 
proposed here is an extension of PMS3  It uses a very simple approach and solves challenging instances 21, 8\or example that have not been reported solved before in the literature. We also propose a new algorithm PMS3p. We expect PMS3p to be significantly faster than PMS3   I  BACKGROUND  1 Genomic sequencing allows the identification of nearly all of the genes in an 
organism, from which the potential gene products can be inferred. However, genomic sequencing does not provide direct information on the function of the individual gene products, nor their interrelationships Motifs provide clues on this function. Several computational approaches for identifying motifs can be found in the literature. These   1 This work has been supported in part by the following grants: NSF 0326155, NSF 0829916 and 
NIH 1R01GM079689-01A1  techniques differ in how motifs are defined and modeled. Each approach looks at a different facet of motifs. No single model or technique can identify all possible motifs The final verification, as to whether a motif is functional or not, can only be assessed experimentally Since experiments are expensive and time consuming computational techniques that can select potential functional motifs with high accuracy are desirable 
Three versions of motif search have been identified in the literature: planted l, d  search \(PMS\t distance based motif search \(EMS\and simple motif search SMS\In this paper we focus on PMS. PMS algorithms have been employed to solve various biological pr oblems. For example Buhler and Tompa  have emplo y e d PMS algorithms to find known transcriptional regulatory elements upstream of several 
eukaryotic genes. Eski n and Pevzner [6 used PMS algorithms to find composite regulatory patterns; and so on Problem Statement  The l d\otif problem takes as input n sequences each of length m Input also are integers l and d The problem is to find a motif M a string of 
length l that occurs in each input sequence up to hamming distance of d  Numerous algorithms have been developed to solve PMS. PMS algorithms can be categorized into two, namely exact algorithms and approximation algorithms An exact algorithm \(also called an exhaustive 


enumeration algorithm ways finds the correct answer\(s\the other hand, an approximation algorithm may not always output the correct answer Some examples of algorithms proposed for PMS are Random Projection  M I TRA  6   W i nnower 7    Pattern Branchin g  8    PMS1 [1 PM SP [9   CE N S U S  1 0   a n d  Voting s e  a l g o r ithms CENSUS, MITRA, PMS1, PMSP and Voting are exact algorithms Certain instances of PMS have been identified to be challenging instances In particular, an l, d motif instance is said to be challenging if the expected number of motifs that occur in the input by random chance is greater than or equal to one \(when the input sequences themselves are generated randomly\. For example the instances \(9,2 13,4\ and \(15,5\e examples of challenging instances. It is customary in the literature to show the performance of PMS algorithms only on challenging instances. It is always a challenge to solve as large a challenging instance of PMS as possible. The largest instance reported solved in the literature thus far is \(19, 7 o r the  f ir s t time, in this paper, we present an algorithm that can solve the \(21,8\nstance. Before presenting details on our algorithm we summarize some of the prior algorithms Pevzner and Sze [7 have propos ed the  WINNOWER algorithm. It generates a list of all the l mers present in the database and constructs a graph out of them. Each l mer represents a node and there is an edge between two nodes if the hamming distance between these two nodes is at most 2 d and they belong to different sequences The problem of finding motifs is then reduced to finding large cliques in this graph. The problem of finding a maximum clique in a graph is known to be NP-hard. The authors use some novel pruning techniques to find large cliques WINNOWER [7 uses a technique to generate Extendable Cliques. It is an iterative algorithm. The run time of this algorithm is O N 2 d 1  N=nm  SP-STAR uses a technique which eliminates more edges than WINNOWER and hence is faster. It uses  less memory as well PatternBranching 8  performs a local search. It generates the neighbors of all l mers present in the sequences and uses a scoring method to assign scores for these neighbors There are n  m l 1 l mers present in the sequences. Each l mer has 3 d neighbors The scores of all the neighbors of all the l mers are computed and the best scoring neighbors are identified. Since it searches through only a selected set of l mers, it is very efficient. This algorithm takes a u and then computes the best neighbor u 1 of u In the next step it identifies the best neighbor u 2 of u 1 and so on till it computes u d The u d  values for all possible u are computed and then the best u d  value becomes the output. In every step it keeps only one value of the best neighbor but there could be a set of l mers which could be the best neighbors for u  MITRA [6 is based on WINNOWER [7   It uses pair wise similarity information. It uses a mismatch tree data structure and splits the space of patterns into subspaces which start with a given prefix. Pruning is applied to each of these subspaces. MITRA performs very well in practice and is one of the best performing algorithms designed for Planted Motif Search Problem Several algorithms for PMS have been proposed in [1  These are ex act al g o rithms based on radix sorting. The first algorithm proposed was PMS1. PMS1 simply generates neighbors of all the l mers present in a sequence and saves it in an array C i where i is the sequence number. It repeats this for all the sequences. The arrays are then sorted. The lmers we get with the intersection of all C i 222s where 1 i n is the list of motifs. However PMS1 is not capable of solving challenging instances with large values of l Some improvements have also been proposed on 


PMS1 in  Another alg orithm proposed is PMS2 [1 h i s c a p a b le of solving challenging instances up to d 4. For instance, it could not solve the Challenging instance \(15, 5\. The third algorithm proposed in [1 was P M S 3 which was neve r implemented or investigated. In this paper we extend and test the performance of PMS3 Two new algorithms PMSP and PMSi were proposed in which were built upon PMS1  and perform a lot better than PMS1 PMSP [3 uses the idea of exploring the neighbors  of all the l mers that occur in the first sequence and then checking if these represent a motif or not. The worst case time bound of this algorithm is worse than that of PMS1 but in practice it performs much better. It is capable of solving the challenging instance \(17, 6 PMPprune [3 is another algorithm based on PMS1 and is an improvement over PMSP It uses a branch and bound approach. It shows significant improvements in terms of time taken and is also capable of solving the challenging instance \(19, 7\. This is the largest challenging instance that has been solved until this paper Another algorithm MCL-WMR was proposed in and it co nsists of 3 steps. Th e  first step is a graph construction. Each l mer in each input sequence is represented as a vertex and an edge is constructed between two vertices when the hamming distance between the two is less than 2 d and a weight is assigned to the edge. The next step is clique finding using graph clustering. The aim of clustering is to decompose the set of vertices into subsets of highly intraconnected vertices. The final step is to identify the motifs, which is done by identifying cliques of size n that have a weight greater than a calculated threshold This algorithm does not work for the challenging instances like \(17, 6\. It can solve the \(non-challenging\ instance \(18,6\e could see, this algorithm is similar to WINNOWER. The algorithm that we propose in this paper is much faster than MCL-WMR  II  ALGORITHM  PMS3 Algorithm PMS3 was initially proposed in [1 The concept behin d PMS3 is that if M  is a motif of length l we can divide it into two parts M 1 and M 2 where M 1 is the first half of M and M 2 is the second half of M Let S=s 1 s 2 205,s m be an input sequence and let S i  be an occurrence of M in S Let l=2l\222 and let  S\222=s i s i+1 205,s i+l\2221 and S\222\222=s i+l\222 s i+l\222 1 205 s i+l1  Clearly, either the hamming distance between M 1 and S 222 is at most d 222 \(where d 222 d 2\e hamming distance between M 2 and S 222\222 is at most d 222. Algorithm PMS3 is based on this observation                         Algorithm PMS3  Get the set R of all motifs of length l\222 that occur in at least n\222 of the input sequences at a hamming of at most d\222  Here l\222  l 2 n\222  n 2, and d\222  d 2 for i 1 to n do for h 0 to d\222 do  Find all the occurrences of all the motifs of R in Si with a hamming distance of h This can be done as follows: form all the l\222 mers of Si keeping track of the starting position of each in Si  For each l\222 mer u Si and all the l\222 mers v such that u and v are at a hamming distance of h If R\222 is the collection of these l\222 mers, sort R and R\222 and  merge them; and figure out all the occurrences of interest For every position p in Si let L  i, p h be the list of all motifs of R that are in Si with a hamming distance of h starting from position p   


                               In the above algorithm A is the set of candidate motifs. Followed by the computation of A we check if each one of these candidates is a valid answer. Each valid answer is then output. Note that for each candidate we need O mnl time to check if this is a valid answer or not  III  IMPLEMENTATION PMS3 is much simpler than prior algorithms such as PMSP, PMSi, PMSprune etc. Also, PMS3 solves the challenging instance \(21, 8\s not been reported solved before. All the algorithms for planted motif search employ random data as a benchmark. We also use the same data. This data is constructed as follows. There will be 20 sequences of length 600 each. Each of these sequences is randomly generated such that each character in each position is equally likely to be one of the symbols in the alphabet. The motif M is also generated randomly in a similar manner. 20 instances of M are generated from M such that each instance is at a hamming distance of d from M These instances are then planted in the input sequences starting from random positions. There are some challenges in implementing the algorithm. The challenging step is the one where the array  A i is obtained The simple method explained in the algorithm works fine with lower values of l  but does not work for higher ones. So instead of generating the arrays one sequence at a time and then taking the intersection, we pick one l\222 mer at a time from the list R and then check for all the occurrences in all the sequences. Next we generate lists Q 222 and Q 222\222 with the neighbors of prefixes and suffixes respectively and get the smaller list  A i Thus it solves the problem of space required to save the list A i as initially proposed in the algorithm. The algorithm was implemented on Xeon processor with 3GHz frequency and 4GB RAM. The coding was done in C  IV  NEW ALGORITHM Both PMSprune [3 n d PMS3 1  a r e ex  I nste a d of usin g arrays to generate and store the neighbors of l-mers, PMSprune e s a tr ee to stor e the neighbors for each l-mer. It also uses a pruning technique, whic h helps improve the runtime significantly. We use a similar idea to improve the performance of PMS3 A  370  for i 1 to n do  Ai  370  for p 1 to m\226 l\222 1 do for h 0 to d\222 do  Let q\222 be the l\222 mer of Si ending at position p 1 and q\222\222 be the l\222 mer starting from position p  l\222  Generate Q\222 the set of all l\222 mers that are at a hamming distance of d - h from q\222  Also generate Q\222\222 the set of all l\222 mers that are at a hamming distance of d\222 - h from q\222\222  for every u L  i, p, h  do for every v Q\222\222 do Append v to the end of u to form an l mer. Add this l mer to Ai  for every v Q\222 do Append u to the end of v to form an l mer and add this l mer to Ai    If  A is empty and Ai is nonempty  then  A  Ai  else if both A and Ai are nonempty  then A  A Ai     


Before discussing the algorithm, we need to explain a tree T\(u\ployed by PMSprune. It  is cons tructed with u as the root node. The nodes of the tree are the neighbors of u. The tree would be of depth at most d. At a level i, the nodes would be at a distance of i from the root. The distance between any node and its parent is always 1 Pruning is applied to a node v if a certain condition is satisfied. Th e details and a proof for the pruning technique is provided in [3   However, it is briefly explained in this paper D\(v, S\follows d\(v, S i distance of v with each l2-mer in sequence S i  D\(v, S\\( d\(v, S i  i t Now, for any node v in tree T\(u\we decide to prune based on the following conditions If D\(v, S\ 2d-h, no descendants of v would be a motif If D\(v, S\= 2d-h, consider only v\222,where v\222,S If D\(v, S\= 2d-h-1, consider only v\222 where v\222 is a child of v and D\(v\222 S\<=D\(v, S Similar to PMS3, PMS3p  divides the lmer into two parts, of size l 1 and l 2  When l is an even number l 1 and l 2 are equal otherwise l 2 is 1 greater than l 1 We take the first sequence and for each l 2 226mer, u, in that sequence we form a tree T\(u\ree is traversed in the depth first way. For each neighbor v of u, we check if v occurs in all the sequence with a hamming distance less than equal to d or not. Then, we also need to check if we need to prune the descendants of v based on the conditions above. If v is pruned, we go to the next neighbor of u. If v is not pruned, we check for all occurrences of v in the sequences. If v occurs at location p in a sequence s at a hamming distance of h, then we generate  all the neighbors of l 1 226 mer at p l 2 at a hamming distance  of d-h and store it a list Q\222. Similarly, we generate  all the neighbors of l 1 226mer at p l 1 at a hamming distance  of d - h and store it a list Q\222\222.  We merge the list Q\222 and Q\222\222 and store it in A s  where s is the sequence number.  At the end we find the intersection of all A s where 1 s t and output that as motifs                       Algorithm PMS3p  Let l 1  l 2 and l 2  l-l 1  Let d 1  d    For each l 2 mer u in S 1  Construct a tree T\(u The tree is traversed in the depth first way For every neighbor v of u If v has already been covered previously If the tree needs to be pruned for v switch to the next neighbor v Let A = null For \( s= 1 to t A s null For \(i=1 to ml 2 1 Calculate h = dist l 2 mer\(s, i\v  If h <= d Let q 1 be the l1-mers, i l 2  Let q 2 be the l1_mer\(s, il 1  Generate neighbors of q 1 at a distance \(d-h\ save in the list Q1 Generate neighbors of q 2  at a distance \(d-h\ save in the list Q2  For each element x in Q1  Add l 2 mer\(s, i\ to A s   For each element x in Q2  Add l 2 mer\(s, i\ A s   Apply radix sort to A s    If \(A= null A=A s  Else A = A intersection A s   Output the l-mers in A    


V  ANALYSIS AND RESULTS PMS3 is a very simple algorithm which does not use complicated data structures. It is capable of solving the challenging instance 21, 8\been solved by any other algorithm yet \(to the best of our knowledge\hows the results of PMS3. The table does not include the result for L less than 17. Although, PMS3 is an efficient algorithm, we had to implement it in such a way so that it is able to work for higher values of L and D. Thus, the algorithm does not perform better than the previous algorithms for the lower values of L L d Time 17 6 20,000 sec 18 6 12,000 sec 19 7 26 hrs 21 8 22 days Table1. Performance results for PMS3 Although, PMSP 3 which are also improvements over PMS1 perform better than PMS3 for \(17, 6\, they are still not able to solve the challenging instance \(21, 8\ MCL-WMR [4 shows g ood  results but it can\222t solve the challenging instance \(17, 6  For challenging instances, the list R generated in PMS3 is of the size nearly equal to 4 l\222 Thus, for such cases we actually check for all possible l\222 mers. This problem is solved in PMS3p by using the pruning technique. For the l 2 mers in Sequence 1, we generate all neighbors with a hamming distance less than or equal to d For challenging instances, this would be of the size 4 l2 The space complexity of this algorithm would be O \(mn\etically the time complexity of PMS3p would be same as PMS3. But, in practice there would be a significant improvement. We can claim this because PMSprune which is an improvement over PMSP, take only 69 minutes to solve 17, 6\ours taken by PMSP PMS3 takes about 5.5 hours to solve the same problem. So, if we implement PMS3p we expect the time taken to be less than an hour. It is noteworthy that MCL-WMR does not work for the challenging instances like 17, 6\It can solve the \(non-challenging instance \(18,6\gorithm proposed in this paper is much faster compared to it VI  CONCLUSION We have extended and implemented PMS3 which was initially proposed in  The algorithm uses a very simple concept Although it takes a little more time than PMSP and PMSprune [3 a p a b le of solving \(21, 8\e of the previous algorithms have been able to solve challenging instances for d 7. For instance our algorithm is better than the algorithm proposed in [4  The algorithm has scope for  improvements and in future we would be working on methods to reduce the time.  The new algorithm PMS3p proposed here has not been implemented yet, but we expect that it would be much faster than PMS3 and will also outperform PMSprune  VII  REFERENCES    S. Rajasekaran, S.

6 CONCLUSION Neptec has developed a vision system for autonomous onorbit rendezvous and docking that does not require the use of cooperative markers on the target spacecraft The system uses an active TriDAR 3D sensor and efficient model based tracking algorithms to provide 6 degree of freedom 6DOF relative pose information in real-time The system takes full advantage of the large amount of geometric information contained in 3D data sets By following the More Information Less Data MILD paradigm where the sensor only acquires the data necessary to obtain the pose of the target real-time performance can be achieve with flight hardware Following the same smart scanning strategy Neptec has developed a novel technique for localizing a known object on-orbit The new technique called Polygonal Aspect Hashing does not require an initial guess of the relative pose and therefore can be used to initialize tracking or recover if tracking is lost Furthermore it only requires a very sparse non organized 3D point cloud thus keeping the data acquisition and pre-processing overhead to a minimum The technique follows logic similar to the process of adding a piece in a jigsaw puzzle First the set of possible positions and orientations of the scan with respect to the model is reduced to the set of poses that have sufficient overlap Once the set of poses is reduced to the most likely candidates a surface fit check is performed to determine the best matching pose The surface fit check measures the amount of overlap between an input scan and the surface of a reference 3D model of the object to find The algorithm developed was tested with both simulated and TriDAR data Results showed excellent performance and demonstrated that the algorithm works well even with very sparse input data sets as well as in the presence of sensor noise and distortions Processing time results obtained showed that real-time performance can be achieved with this technique As would be expected it was shown that the robustness can be increased by testing more polygons at the expense of processing time Another alternative would be to run the algorithm with one polygon over several sequential scans This technique would be well suited for operations where there is relative motion between the sensor and target like in a tumbling satellite scenario or if the processing power is limited In the future Neptec plans to test more objects with representative geometry and materials to further characterize the algorithm performance The effect of object symmetries will also be investigated It was observed that most failures tend to occur where the object is most symmetric Code optimization will also be performed to further improve performance 1 MacLean S Pinkney L Machine Vision in Space Can Aeronaut Space J 39\(2 63-77 1993 2 Howard Richard T Bryan Thomas C DART AVGS flight results Proc SPIE Vol 6555 pp.65550L 2007 3 Ruel S English C Anctil M Church P 43DLASSO Real-time pose estimation from 3D data for autonomous satellite servicing Proc ISAIRAS 2005 Conference Munich Germany 5-8 September 2005 ESA SP-603 4 Ruel S English C Anctil M Daly J Smith C Zhu S Real-time 3D vision solution for on-orbit autonomous rendezvous and docking Proc SPIE Vol 6220 pp.622009 2006 5 Andrew Johnson and Martial Hebert Using spin images for efficient object recognition in cluttered 3-D scenes IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 21\(5 449 May 1999 6 H Wolfson I Rigoutsos Geometric Hashing An Overview IEEE Computational Science  Engineering 4\(4 October 1997 7 English C Zhu X Smith C Ruel S Christie I TriDAR A hybrid sensor for exploiting the complimentary nature of triangulation and LIDAR technologies Proc ISAIRAS 2005 Conference Munich Germany 5-8 September 2005 ESA SP-603 8 J Obermark G Creamer B Kelm W Wagner C Henshaw SUMO/FREND vision system for autonomous satellite grapple Proc SPIE Vol 6555 pp 65550Y 2007 9 Deslauriers A Showalter I Montpool A Taylor R Christie I Shuttle TPS inspection using triangulation scanning technology SPIE 2005 Orlando Florida April 2005 10 Ruel S English C Melo L Berube A Aikman D Deslauriers A Church P and Maheux J Field testing of a 3D Automatic Target Recognition and Pose Estimation Algorithm SPIE Defense  Security Symposium Orlando Florida April 12-16 2004 11 English C Ruel S Melo L Church P and Maheux J Development of a Practical 3D Automatic Target Recognition and Pose Estimation Algorithm SPIE Defense  Security Symposium Proceedings on Automatic Target Recognition XIV Orlando Florida April 2004 10 REFERENCES

A filter lag or so-called cluster tracking can easily result in a 5% or greater offset and degraded consistency.  After 300 seconds the curves peak up because the target is appr oaching a low-elevation beampoint limit.  This occurs anytime a target is tracked into the edge of the radar\222s field of re gard and can lead to radar-toradar handover difficulty         300 300 80  s D 2 k,1 k y    s D 2 k,1 k y   100 150 200 250 10 1                    10 5 1 0  Figure 8 - Consistency versus distance from beam center Monopulse Mismatch The next set of curves plotted in Figure 9 show the sensitivity of detection-primitive consistency to a mismatch in the monopulse slope.  All of these curves were generated using a linear monopulse response derived from the slope of the true monopulse response at beam center.  The slope of the 80% curve is 0.8 times th e beam-center slope; the 90 curve is 0.9 times the beam-center slope; and so on for 100%, 110% and 120%.  Again, the order of curves in the graph is the same as the legend order A steep slope tends to expand y I 222s uncertainty while a gentle slope tends to compress it.  An expanded uncertainty leads to a smaller consistency while a compressed uncertainty leads to a larger consistency.  This behavior can be observed in the family of curves in Figure 9.  Curves for the steeper slopes are on the botto m while curves for more gentle slopes are on top.  The notable feature of this set of curves is that the sensitivity to a mismatch in the monopulse slope is not very significant       100 150 200 250 10 1                    90 100 110 120  Figure 9 - Consistency versus monopulse mismatch Range-Bias Error The complex nature of the monopulse radar models presents ample opportunity to introduce errors in the software implementation.  One such e rror introduced in a \275 rangecell-width bias in the detection-primitive range which in turn resulted in a significant degradation to 2 9 k D The fact that 2 9 k D is measured in different coordinates compared to the bias made it difficult to determine which value or algorithm was to blame.  Examining the intermediate consistency values led directly to the error source A comparison between biased 2 1 k D  2 2 k D and 2 3 k D values and unbiased 2 2 k D values is shown in Figure 10.  The unbiased 2 2 k D is the bottom-most curve and the biased 2 3 k D is the top-most curve with a value around 80.  This large value for 2 3 k D indicates that there is a lot more uncertainty in the range measur ements compared to what is predicted by the range varian ce.  Since the range-variance calculation is easy to confirm, the problem must be in the algorithms that model or manipulate range A notable feature of Figure 10 is the sensitivity of the centroiding algorithm to range bias in the detection primitives.  The range bias is ba rely noticeable in the biased 2 1 k D and 2 2 k D curves.  Of course, if the unbiased 2 2 k D  curve existed as a baseline it would be relatively easy to spot the error

As previously promised, the effects and corrections for atmospheric refr action and sensor bias have been disabled so that 2 8 k D can be analyzed using a sliding window.  Of course the full analysis would include these effects and 2 8 k D at each time step would be collected and averaged over many trials Plots of the effect of changing process noise in a nearlyconstant-velocity filter are shown in Figure 12 and Figure 13 for Cartesian position and velocity respectively.  In both figures, the plotted values have been divided by 3 so that the desired value is always 1.  Increasing the process noise up to a point should increase the updated uncertainty and reduce 2 8 k D values.  Except near th e end of the trajectory when the measurements are off of beam center, the curves in Figure 12 and Figure 13 appear inconclusive for this expected trend If 2 8 k D values are way out of range there are additional intermediate filter values that can be examined.

Analyzing covariance consistency is applicable to radar systems both in the field and in simulations.  The primary challenge in both arenas comes down to properly accounting for the true target states that contribute to detections, detection primitives measurements, and state estimates For a fielded radar syst em, achieving covariance consistency is usually a s econdary consideration behind achieving and maintaining track s.  Indeed, until recently radar specifications did not even include requirements for covariance consistency.  Recent covariance consistency requirements stem from the fact that the use of radar systems in sensor netting applications is on the rise Currently the combined e ffects of off-beam-center measurements, atmospheric correction, bias correction clustering and centrioding, data association, and filtering on state covariance consistency throughout a target\222s trajectory are not well known.  This is particularly true for radars using wideband waveforms and multiple hypotheses or multiple frame trackers.  Numerical results presented here indicate that algorithms early in the radar signal processing chain can significantly degrad e covariance consistency and that some errors are better tolerated than others For a simulated target in a modeled system, truth relative to some global reference is known. However, transforming truth through different refere nce frames and accounting for changes that occur during various radar processing algorithms is not as simple as it appears.  The techniques in this paper help expose this hidden complexity and provide a framework for discussing and expanding the future development of covariance consistency techniques.  Such future developments include issues related to mapping truth through the convolution operation typically used to simulate wideband signal processing and the fast Fourier transforms typically used in pulse-Doppler processing.  Sophisticated tracking algorithms that carry multiple hypotheses, associate across multiple frames, or weight the association of multiple targets within a single frame pose significant challenges in properly associating truth with state estimates.  Additional work, including an investigation of track-to-truth assignment, is needed before covariance consistency techniques can be applied to these algorithms Another area that needs furthe r analysis is the use of a sliding window to approximate the covariance behavior expected during a set of Monte-Carlo trials.  Various timedependent variables such as the target\222s range and orientation, the transmit waveform, the radar\222s antenna patterns toward the target, missed detections, and false alarms could easily viol ate the assumption that measurement conditions are nearly stationary over the time of the window.  It is importa nt to understand the conditions when this assumption is violated Finally, the examples presented here included a relatively benign arrangement of targets.  Further analysis in dense target environments with the related increase in merged detections, merged measurements, and impure tracks is needed.  Further analysis for targets traveling over different trajectories is also needed Even so, the techniques presented here can be extended to many of these analyses R EFERENCES  1  S. Blackman and R.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs.
