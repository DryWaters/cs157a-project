INTRODUCTION Information technology brings a great convenience to people's lives and work, but with its deeper and extensive application in the social life, it also brings many new problems, in which the data security is one of the most prominent problems Network systems, operating systems and database management systems are three supporting platforms of the information system, which is an inseparable whole, any of them having a security risk will directly affect the entire information system security. In particular, the security of the database plays a vital role in the information system because in the overall security of information systems database is often the ultimate goal, is the core and foundation of information systems, most likely to attract attackers [I] . Therefore, intrusion detection has become a very important security measure, also an essential last line of defense in any security system II. DATABASE INTRUSION DETECTION AND DATA MINING OVERVIEW A. Database intrusion detection The security framework of the database system can be divided into three levels: network system level, host operating system level, and database management system level. These three levels form the security system of the database system, which is gradually close to the data 


security, the importance of preventing is also strengthened layer by layer, to ensure the security of data from outside to inside 1 Broadly speaking, the security of the database firstly depends on the network system. Network system is the external environment and the basis of the database application, so to play a strong role of the database system can not part from the support of the network system, and the 978-1-4244-5540-9/10/$26.00 2010 IEEE 673 database system users \(such as remote users, distributed 2] users network. So the security of the network system is the first database security barrier, and the external intrusion is begun from the network system 2 The operating system is the running platform of large database system, which is to provide a certain degree of security for the database system. At present, most of the operating system platforms are focused on Windows NT and UNIX, security level is usually Cl and C2level [3] . The main security technologies are operating system security policy security management strategy, data security, and so on 3 technology Database system security relies on the database management system in high degree, if the database management system has a very powerful security mechanism then the database system will has better security performance The three levels of the database system security framework are complementary with each other, and the prevention focus and the technical means adopted of them are not the same, so a good security system must take into account and apply these technologies to ensure data security B. Data mining main algorithms Data mining is an interdisciplinary field, affected by a number of disciplines, including database systems, statistics machine learning, visualization and information science There are many data mining methods commonly used in database intrusion detection, in which the association rule 


mining algorithm and sequential pattern mining algorithm are widely applied in particular. Association rule is to find the correlation of different items appeared in the same event Association rule mining is to derive the implication relationships between data items under the conditions of a set of given project types and a number of records and through analyzing the records, the commonly used algorithm is Apriori algorithm III. ASSOCIATION RULE ALGORITHM IMPROVEMENT There are many association rule algorithms, and this paper focuses on analysis and research of Apriori algorithm A. Apriori algorithm flow Apriori algorithm is the basic algorithm to mine and generate the frequent item sets Boolean association rules needed, is also a very effective association rule mining [4] . .  . fl h  algorithm . The specIfic ImplementatlOn ow as s own 1ll figure 1 Transaction database 0; minimum support threshold min _su p LI=findJrequent_I-itemset\(D N I N1= Number\( i t e m set of 4.1 N2=Number\(each\(k-I m=l,boll=ture m<=N2 674 N3= Number\(transaction of D: 11=1 N4= Number\(candidate ofCtr, p=1 n=I1=1 Figure I. Fig.1 Apriori algorithm flow chart 8. Apriori algorithm improvement Apriori algorithm has the following two defects i candidate item sets 2 carry out pattern matchingfor the candidate item sets Just because the above two flaws, this paper presents the technology based on the data partition to improve the adaptability and efficiency of the Apriori algorithm. It can use data partition technique for mining frequent item sets with only two times of the whole database scan. As shown in 


figure 2, it contains two main processing stages. The first phase, the algorithm will divide the transactional database D into n independent parts; if the minimum support threshold in the database D is min_sup, then the minimum support frequency threshold corresponding to each part IS  b f  f 5 mm_supxnum er_o _transactIOn_o yartItIOn . For each division \(part they are called local frequent item sets Transaction data 0 o is divided into n blocks; i ; I N Min c block i local frequent itemsets i=i+1 Construct candidate itemsets Find all frequent itemsets in the candidate itemsets END Figure 2. Partition mining frequent item sets by using data In terms of the whole database D, a local frequent item set is not necessarily the global frequent item set, but any global frequent item set will certainly occur in the local frequent item sets obtained by the partition. This is very easy to get evidence to the contrary. Therefore, the local frequent 675 item sets mined from n partitions can be as the candidate item set of the frequent item sets in the whole database D and in the second stage again scanning the entire database for the support frequency of all candidate item sets, to finally confirm the global frequent item set. The partition size and number has the standard that each partition can be entirely placed into memory, so each stage only needs to read the database content once, and the entire mining needs to scan the entire database twice IV. DATABASE INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM BASED ON IMPROVED ASSOCIA nON RULE ALGORITHM A. System structure The main components of the system as shown in figure 3 


Data 7 Historical log data Data mining Determine the rule base Rule base update Figure 3. intrusion detection system flow chart It works as follows i history log records qfier auditing, and the other is increased by the network new data after judgment. TherifOre, the obtained normal data is updated dynamically, can timely ntlect the latest circs rather than limited to historical data 2 generate data records with a specific format 3 using an improved association rules algorithm in this paper to mine the normal or abnormal rules existed between d!lforent projects to generate decision rules and send to the rule base for storage 4 rules generatedfrom the current network data stream with the judgment rules in the rule base, calculate with the similarity, and then judge the results This system is a circularly and dynamically updated system, but it must first create a set of legitimate access rules from a static database as the basis for the system's judgment After entering the dynamic intrusion detection management process, the normal data may be extracted from the historical network data stream through the intrusion detection, or the additional data judged to be legitimate, which strictly removes all the possible invasion data, so the rules extracted from the normal data are normal rules, of course, the better the more training data, thus the extracted rules are more complete [6] . When the historical records have not a major change, the auditing of them can be suspended, but only the additional data should be processed, which is also an another improvement of this system to save system resources B. Intrusion detection experimental results and analysis This experiment is mainly to detect three types of intrusion, separately is legitimate user intrusion, disguised

CONCLUSION Combining with the data mining application in database intrusion detection, for the most representative association rule Apriori algorithm in the data mining technology, this paper presents an improved association rule algorithm, based on which constructs a database intrusion detection system on the basis of association rules, and carries out a small range test. Experimental results show that the rule base of this system can timely and effectively reflect the latest situation better complete the intrusion judgment, and the test accuracy can meet the basic requirements, well improve the efficiency of the whole intrusion detection flow REFERENCES I].

33%, confidence is 90%. However, the rules relevant to excel by using Apriori algorithm can not be found at the same thresholds And then, add score of single choice, the total score of student and the college as horizontal weighted items to transaction database, furthermore, 0.5, 1.2 and 1 have been assigned to the items in sequence. Other items' weights are the same as above setting. Score of single choice has been divided into three sections in the same way, and a certain notation has been assigned to each part. Also total score has been treated in the same way. In sequence, use notation A, B and C instead of scores in excellent, average and weak sections for single-choice questions, X, Y and Z for total score. With Wminsup=20% and Wminconf=30%, the following valuable rules have been discovered in the database 9 ? CCW sup = 27%, Wcan! = 38 9 ? L\(W sup = 27%, Wean! = 39 9 ? O\( W sup = 27%, Wean! = 69 9 ? Z\(W sup = 27%, Weanf = 83 Then set Wminsup=50% and Wminconf=80%, the rules have been extracted from the database o u Z ? T\(W sup = 53%, Wearif = 87 O u T  ? C\(W sup = 78%, Wean! = 100 Analyzing of the first four rules can discover that students from college of File art get the worst score in optional questions. Only if teachers strengthen the teaching of this chapter can improve average of the college, thereby improving average of the university. From later two rules we can find that grades of excel, optional and single choice have closer relationship with total score than other scores of questions. But if apply Apriori to mining rules in the transaction database and only if minimum support is decreased to 5%, rules relation with colleges can be obtained Moreover, the last rule with 48% support and 95 confidence can be obtained by using Apriori. Obviously using mixed weighted association rules algorithm improves the support and confidence of rules, and makes them be discovered easier VII. CONCLUSION This paper takes college computer cultural foundation course grade database as example, applies mixed weighted 


association rules algorithm to obtain some importance and valuable information according to characteristic of the database, such as the correlations of chapters, and the factors influence total score of students. The information has reference value for teaching, and is helpful to improve learning efficiency of students. Ultimately, the average scores of the students are improved. Similarly, the approach of analysis in scores of computer foundation course database can also be applied in other college examination course grade database, such like college English test grades database, principles of Marxist philosophy test scores database and so on. In addition, application in other database like national computer rank test, CET-4, a lot of valuable information can be discovered. This important information as reference for the teaching reform is beneficial to improve quality of teaching REFERENCES I] R. Agrawal and R.

We can then substitute in Equation \(5 obtain the extreme points of the lines in ?. Finally, we apply the homogeneous transformation to transform the coordinates of those points to the global coordinate system and trace the 3D lines. The result is shown in Fig. 8. Observe how the vertical lines are consistent with the 2D map Fig. 8. Environment with 3D lines VI. DISCUSSION AND PERSPECTIVES This paper describes an original composite sensor approach that takes advantage of the information given by an omnidirectional camera and a laser range finder to ef 


ficiently solve the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping problem for indoor environments, and to reconstruct a 3D representation of the environment. The accompanying video illustrates the incremental generation of a 2D map and the estimation of the robot trajectory alongside the laser range data projected on omnidirectional images. It also shows the vertical lines detected in the images and their mapping into a 3D reconstruction of the environment In order to show the robustness of the methodology, we tested the algorithm with a sequence taken in a different indoor environment with our old robot Anis which is equipped with the same catadioptric camera and an AccuRange 4000 2D laser range finder. This laser is composed of a laser telemeter with a rotating mirror that allows measurements of points on 360?, except for an occlusion cone of approximately 30? caused by the assembly of the mirror. The resulting 2D map is shown in Figure 9. The vertical line extraction and the reconstruction of the 3D environment were 3523 Fig. 9. Global Map obtained by SLAM in Borel Building consistent as well The SLAM problem has been solved using many different approaches, however some important problems need to be addressed that are often directly linked to the sensors used Laser range finders cannot help in evaluating the translation of a robot moving in a straight line in a corridor. Mapping in dynamic environments is also hard with only laser data. On the other hand, using visual sensors alone introduces issues such as propagating correctly the scale factor, initializing the range when using a monocular sensor, and merging data when using multiples cameras In our approach, the laser provides metric information of the environment that helps to fix a scale factor \(removing the difficulty of propagating the scale factor need to use multiple cameras. Throughout the paper we have identified several advantages of combining laser and visual sensors. Our experimental results are encouraging and give us valuable insight into the possibilities offered by this composite sensor approach We have considered several research directions that could be pursued to improve the results obtained so far. We have thought about extending our algorithm with loop closure de 


tection. This would allow the algorithm to detect previously visited locations and improve the accuracy of mapping and the precision in the estimation of the robot pose. Being able to detect previously visited places is of great importance to solve the problem of global localization and to recover the robot from kidnapping, a situation occurring when the robot is displaced by something out of its control \(e.g. taking an elevator, being transported from one location to another Therefore, solving the loop closure problem will not only improve SLAM performance, but will as well enable new capabilities Further work will concentrate on an extension of the PSM algorithm to exploit the information about vertical lines detected using omnidirectional images. Segmentation of the ground \(floor a dense \(textured onto the geometric model of the world. Finally, we believe the general approach can be extended to solve the full six degrees of freedom \(6DOF active field of research REFERENCES 1] L.Charbonnier and O.Strauss, A suitable polygonal approximation for laser range finder data, Proceedings of the Intelligent Vehicles 95 Symposium, Detroit, Mi, 1995, pp 118-123 2] J.Nieto, T.Bailey and E.Nebot, Recursive scan-matching SLAM Robotics and Autonomous Systems, vol. 55, 2007, pp 39-49 3] J.S.

As can be seen, in general, TOP-MATA shows a better performance than TOP-DATA. And as the increase of the ? value, the advantage tends to be even more impressive for these four data sets 4.3. The Computation Saving of TOP-MATA As can be seen in the Tab. 4, four data sets, enjoy signi?cant computation savings brought by TOP-MATA. We can conclude that the computation saving is a major factor for the performance of TOP-MATA. That is, compared with TOP-DATA, a higher computation saving implies a much better performance of TOP-MATA. Since this saving is more signi?cant as the increase of the items, TOP-MATA works better for large scale data sets with a large number of items 5. Conclusion In this paper, we studied the problem of searching for top? item pairs with the highest cosine values among all item pairs. Speci?cally, we provided a novel algorithm TOPMATA which employ a Max-First traversal strategy for ef?ciently performing top-? cosine similarity search. Extensive experimental results veri?ed the effectiveness of the algorithms, And TOP-MATA algorithm is superior to TOPDATA for large-scale data sets with multiple items Acknowledgment This research was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China \(NSFC No. 70901002 and the Ph.D. Programs Foundation of Ministry of Education of China \(No. 20091102120014
