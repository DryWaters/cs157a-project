For real-time applications that consist of massive number of rules, partitioning of the rules to support parallel processing is important. This paper proposes a suite of algorithms called GAPCM for parallel processing of massive number of rules. By consi dering even distribution, minimal waiting time and minimal inter-processor communication, we propose three algorithms for subnet allocation, and apply these algorithms to association rule mining Keywords: massive rules; parallel processing; subnet allocation GAPCM; association rule; co-location patterns I I NTRODUCTION With the rapid growth of Internet, the need for IT platforms 
that can handle a large number of business and/or scientific rules is becoming more popular. Such platforms are especially important for real-time appli cations. This paper proposes a suite of algorithms called GAPCM for parallel processing of massive number of rules. By considering even distribution minimal waiting time and minimal inter-processor communication, we propose three algorithms for subnet allocation, and apply these algorithms to association rule mining This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the work related to massive rule 
networks and applications. In Section 3, three algorithms are described in detail. Section 4 introduces a medical example. Concl usions and a discussion of future work are given in Section 5 II R ELATED WORK Association rule mining is to find the relationship between item sets in massive data. At first, association rule mining was just to find frequent appearances of transactions in a relational   The Microsoft association rules algorithm straightforward implem entation of the well-known Apriori algorithm. The Apriori algorithm does not analyze patterns, but 
rather generates and then co unts candidate itemsets. An item can represent an event, a product, or the value of an attribute depending on the type of data being analyzed. In recent years the Apriori algorithm of mini ng association rules has been widely carried out for medical applications   29 30 31 32 F o r exa m p le, association rule algorithms can be applied to the analysis of data generated by multiple symptoms and diseases in order to reduce treatment errors. Many experts moved forward the basic idea of applying this algorithm, combined with 
statistical methods, to extract complications of a disease How to deal with massive number of rules for real-time applications is a great challenge Traditional algorithms for rule processing, e.g., RETE  3] and TRE AT [4][5][6], are not sufficient. To meet the requirement of real-time or near-real time applications parallel processin g is inevitabl e, and the quality of partitioning plays a critical role Recently many methods have been proposed for data partitioning. In User Manual classifi cation user configures partitions by th 
emselves. In this case the level of experience and knowledge of th e user plays a very important role. Angle-based partitioning [9  m ultiple classes according to different angles, and handles the data partitions separately.

Feature-driven and divides data according to common characteristics of the data This method is processed in a parallel and incremental way  rent partitioning m e thods have been employed for handling di fferent data.

Given a massive rule network that may consist of many unconnected sub-networks, the first task is to distinguish and det ect all sub-networks Considering the limited number of processors, the load balance between processors and the cost of communication between processors GAPCM has a process that reallocates the sub-networks to different processors. A sub-network is further divided into blobs to preserve data and cont rol dependencies. The blobs are assembled into different tasks and the tasks are mapped to different processors. Finally a ll processors work concurrently to process the rules. Figure 1 shows the steps of GAPCM Figure 1. GAPCM Architecture B Constructing Sub-network of Rules In GAPCM a massive rule network is converted into a set of sub-networks that are independent of each other. These subnetworks have no connection with each other. We call these sub-networks independent sub-rule networks sub-networks in short\ A sub-network does not rely on any ot her sub-network so it can be processed alone if it is not too big to fit into one processor It is not difficult to disti nguish and detect sub-networks, as this problem can be converted to the Graph traversal problem  Figure 2 illustrates one example      Figure 2. Constructing Sub-Rule Networks C Partition Criteria After th e sub-networks are constructed they need to be assigned to different processors for processing. Some subnetworks may be accommodated by one processor, and some may need to be allocated to different processors. The quality of assignment is critical to the performance The main criteria of assigni ng sub-networks include 1 002 Distribute the sub-networks as evenly as possible 2 002 Minimize wait time 3 002 Minimize the communication between processors We illustrate the three criteria in Figure 3   Figure 3. Workload Assignment

The massive rule network in Figure 3 is assigned to three processors. Obviously, processor 1 has more loads than processor 2 or processor 3. So this is not a balanced assignment Let us look at the sub-networks of  processor 1, node C4 relies on node C5, i.e., C4 has to wait un til C5 is finished. Therefore it is desired that C5 is processed before C4. From Figure 3, we also see that node C6 is allocat ed to processor 2, and node C8 is allocated to processo r 3. As the input of C8 relies on the output of C6, there must be communication between processor 2 and processor 3 Based on the above, we propo se three partitioning methods  Algorithm 1  Ordinary Balanced Partitioning Principles 002 002 Only consider load balance 002 Do not consider wait time 002 Do not consider inter-pr ocessor communication Suppose a massive rule network with n nodes needs to be partitioned to p processors. Let x 1  x 2  x p 1  x p he load ratios of the processors. Obvi ously, the ideal situation is x 1 x 2  x p 1 x p R However in practice this situation is hard to achieve.

W e can create a rule network which merges all the ten rules shown in Figure 10 which also shows some optimization, e.g C2 and C9 are the same and merged into C2, and C4 and C12 are the same and merged into C4 We used simulated data to test the three algorithms of GAPCM In order to facilita te the comparison between the algorithms and to simplify programming, we assumed that only 30% of the groups will be reserved and proceed into the filter step The test data used in Figure 11 has 60 computing nodes.

These intervals are computed based on the risk RSA 1.65;+1.65] 10 1.96;+1.96] 5 2.58;+2.58] 1 3.29;+3.29] 0.1 TABLE V INTERVALS IN WHICH NON-SIGNIFICANCE IS DETECTED When the RSA is applied to the association education ? wage results listed in table VI education wage [6;7] [8;9] [10;13] [14;18 2.85; 4.70] 1.83 1.69 3.88 -4.94 4.75; 7.14] 0.41 0.76 1.37 -1.88 7.30; 12.67] -0.72 -0.62 0.17 0.59 13.00; 26.29] -0.99 -1.49 -6.35 6.56 TABLE VI ADJUSTED STANDARDIZED RESIDUAL OF THE ASSOCIATION EDUCATION-WAGE The negative values denote underrepresentativeness, and the positive ones overrepresentativeness We can now transpose these results to initial variations contingency, table III Table VII represents the enhanced variations contingency. In order to notice the differences, all grayed cells are pruned thanks to the RSA education wage [6;7] [8;9] [10;13] [14;18 2.85; 4.70] 3 4 15 -22 4.75; 7.14] 1 3 8 -12 7.30; 12.67] -2 -3 1 5 13.00; 26.29] -1 -4 -25 30 TABLE VII ENHANCED CONTINGENCY TABLE OF VARIATIONS FOR THE ASSOCIATION \(EDUCATION-WAGE This table is the starting point of the consolidation process described below 39 


V. CONSOLIDATION PROCESS The first step to build the largest zones is to scan the enhanced contingency table of variations looking for the cell with the highest absolute value This cell constitutes the first rectangle noted R1 with the coordinates of upper left point pl and lower right point pr The second scan compares all the values in the immediate neighborhood of R1. The expansion is performed in descending fashion, i.e. starting from the largest value with similar behavior of the constituted rectangle expanded to the new coordinates The expansion of the formed rectangle continues by performing the summation of its vicinity cells values. We start by including cells whose values sum is the largest. The expansion stops once meeting null cells and the consolidation process ends when all maximal rectangles are formed. These results allow restricting the number of records to be processed by only keeping those retained after the consolidation phase When applying this process to the enhanced contingency table of variations resulting from the education-wage only would be considered the records included in the clusters "education=[10;13]" or "education=[14;18]" associated to "wage=[2.85;4.70]" or wage=[13;26.29 Notice, in the case of the association education ? wage process enables to focus on 172 records instead of 526 \(32 VI. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we describe our discretization approach focusing on the potential interactions between a databases variables. This approach makes it possible to carry out a contextual discretization maximizing the informativeness and highlighting the variables dependencies The use of a tabular representation is particularly interesting in the case of numeric variables
