But a fundamental\nproblem is how to objectively evaluate an algorithm in terms of\nits ability to correctly identify false alarms and true alarms. To\nimprove the utilization of various machine learning algorithms,\nintelligent false alarm reduction has been proposed that aims\nto select and apply an appropriate algorithm in an adaptive\nway. Traditional metrics \(e.g., true positive rate, false positive\nrate metric seems suf?cient and objective enough\nto measure the capability of an algorithm in reducing false\nalarms. The lack of an objective and single metric makes it\ndif?cult to further ?ne-tune and evaluate the performance of\nalgorithms in reducing IDS false alarms. In this paper, we\nbegin by describing the relationship between the process of\nintrusion detection and the process of false alarm detection\n\(reduction Then we provide an information-theoretic analysis\nof intelligent false alarm reduction and propose an objective\nand single metric to evaluate different algorithms in identifying\nIDS false alarms. We further evaluate our metric under three\nscenarios by comparing it with several existing metrics.\nKeywords-Intrusion Detection, False Alarm Reduction, Algo-\nrithm Measurement, Information-Theoretic Metric.\nI INTRODUCTION\nIntrusion detection systems \(IDSs monitor system\nor network events for malicious activities. During the past\nyears, IDSs have been further developed and well-studied\nwith the purpose of detecting novel attacks and improving\ndetection accuracy. These systems can be roughly classi?ed\ninto two folders: signature-based IDS and anomaly-based\nIDS. A signature-based \(or rule-based  signatures, while an anomaly-based IDS [19] detects a\npotential attack by identifying great deviations between pre-\nde?ned normal pro?le and observed events. Several hybrid\nintrusion detection systems [10] have also been developed\nby integrating the above techniques.\nProblem. Although intrusion detection systems have well\nproven their capability of detecting various attacks and have\nbecome an essential part for current defense infrastructure,\na big challenge is that a large number of alarms, especially\nfalse alarms, are generated by these systems during the\ndetection [14, 15]. The large number of false alarms can\ngreatly reduce the ef?ciency of an IDS and signi?cantly\nincrease the burden on analyzing these alarms. For example,\nthousands of alarms may be generated in a day, which are\na big burden for a security of?cer. Even worse, false alarms\ncan make a negative effect on the analysis of IDS outputs\n\(i.e., reducing the accuracy of analysis  Therefore,\nfalse alarm is a key limiting factor in impeding the further\ndevelopment of these detection systems 2].\nTo mitigate this problem, constructing a machine learning\nbased false alarm ?lter is a promising and effective way that\nis easy to design \(i.e., without modifying the structure of an\nIDS deploy \(i.e., deploying behind an\nIDS applied to reducing false alarms. Every work\nclaims that their algorithm can achieve a better outcome.\nHowever, in real-world applications, the ?ltration accuracy\nof an algorithm may be ?uctuant \(i.e., in some scenarios, the\naccuracy is not good but quite good in other scenarios inherent limitations of machine\nlearning algorithms.\nTo further resolve this issue, intelligent false alarm lter\n\(or called intelligent false alarm reduction  from a pool of\nalgorithms. This ?lter enables the algorithm selection in an\nadaptive way with the purpose of keeping a high and stable\n?ltration accuracy. But a fundamental challenge is how to\nappropriately and objectively compare the performance of\ndifferent machine learning schemes in reducing false alarms\nand select the best one.\nMotivation. Measuring the capability of an algorithm \(i.e.,\nclassifying an incoming alarm as true or false Our motivation is therefore to develop\nan objective and single metric, in the context of intelligent\nfalse alarm reduction, to measure the capability of different\nmachine learning schemes and make a better decision.\n2013 12th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications\n978-0-7695-5022-0/13 $26.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/TrustCom.2013.33\n241\nContributions. In this paper, we ?rst identify the relation-\nship between the process of false alarm reduction and the\nprocess of intrusion detection by establishing their abstract\nmodels. Then, based on information theory, we propose\nan objective and single metric in measuring the capability\nof different machine learning schemes in identifying false\nalarms. Our contributions can be summarized as below:\n• We establish and compare the abstract models 


between\nthe process of intrusion detection and the process of\nfalse alarm reduction. By analyzing these two models,\nwe indicate that it is feasible to apply information the-\nory to the measurement of an algorithm in identifying\nand reducing IDS false alarms.\n• Referring to [8], we ?ne-tune and propose a single and\nobjective metric of RCFA \(False Alarm Reduction Ca-\npability is similarly de?ned as the ratio of the mutual\ninformation between the algorithm input and output to\nthe entropy of the input alarm.\n• In the evaluation, we further analyzed other existing\nmetrics \(e.g., decision value, relative expected cost results indicate that RCFA is a better\nmetric in the ?eld of intelligent false alarm reduction.\nNote that our proposed metric of RCFA can be regarded\nas an application of CID \(Intrusion Detection Capability  area of intelligent false alarm reduction. But it is still\nexisting some differences in the evaluation of an IDS and an\nalgorithm \(we will discuss it later existing metrics such as\ntrue positive and false positive, but attempts to complement\npreviously developed metrics and provide another view of\nmachine-learning based false alarm reduction.\nThe remaining parts of this paper are organized as follows.\nIn Section II, we introduce the background of intelligent\nfalse alarm reduction. We establish and compare the ab-\nstract models between the process of intrusion detection\nand the process of false alarm reduction, and describe the\nconstruction of our proposed metric of RCFA in Section III.\nSection IV analyzes current existing metrics and describes\nthe computation of our proposed metric Section V presents\nthe evaluation of RCFA under several scenarios. Section VI\nintroduces related work and Section VII concludes our work\nand presents future directions.\nII. INTELLIGENT FALSE ALARM REDUCTION\nCurrently, a number of machine learning algorithms have\nbeen developed and applied to the area of IDS false alarm\nreduction. In real applications, it is sometimes very hard to\nevaluate these schemes, though each algorithm claims that\nthey can achieve a better result in the experiment. The main\nreason is that the performance of an algorithm may be varied\nunder distinct scenarios \(i.e., the output depends heavily on\nthe training datasets nIntelligent Algorithm Selection \nAlarm Standardization \nFalse Alarm Reduction \nAlarm Processing \nID\nS nA\nla\nrm\ns \nFigure 1. The high-level architecture of the intelligent false alarm ?lter.\nalgorithm always achieve a better output under some speci?c\nscenarios.\nTo mitigate this problem, one of the potential alternatives\nis to select an appropriate algorithm in an adaptive way,\nwhich is called intelligent false alarm reduction \(technique  appropriate algorithm from a\npool which performs the best single-algorithm performance.\nThe basic idea is to adaptively choose an effective and\nsingle algorithm. The major merits of this approach are:\n1 algorithms in an adaptive way can maintain\n?ltration accuracy at a stable and high level; 2 algorithm can relatively reduce computational burden\nespecially on a resource-limited device; and 3 approach\ncan be easily extended by utilizing ensemble technique \(i.e.,\ncombining two or more algorithms high-level architecture of the intelligent false alarm\n?lter is shown in Fig. 1. There are four major components in\nthe architecture: Alarm Standardization, Alarm Processing,\nIntelligent Algorithm Selection and False Alarm Reduction.\nThe component of Alarm Standardization consists of two\nphases: feature extraction and format conversion. When\nan IDS alarm arrives, this component will ?rst extract its\nfeatures and then convert this alarm into a standard format.\nThe feature extraction is depending heavily on an IDS, that\nis, for different IDSs, selected features may be a bit different.\nTake Snort [22] for an example, its alarms can be represented\nusing 8 features: description, classi?cation, priority, packet\ntype, source IP address, source port number, destination IP\naddress and destination port number. After extracting these\npre-de?ned features all the incoming alarms are converted\ninto standard alarms \(the alarms which are represented by\nmeans of the de?ned feature-set extraction. The alarm\n242\nstorage provides a database for storing all \(standard extraction allows algorithms to request some\ndata \(e.g., labeled alarms the\ncomponent of Intelligent Algorithm Selection, the ?lter can\nselect the most appropriate machine learning algorithm in\nan adaptive way. To evaluate different algorithms, several\nmetrics \(e.g., decision value [17 relative expected cost [16 performs alarm reduction by means\nof selected algorithm and outputs true alarms.\nIII. OUR PROPOSED METRIC\nIn this section, we identify the relationship between the\nprocess of intrusion detection and the process of false alarm\nreduction, and describe our proposed metric of RCFA \(False\nAlarm Reduction Capability Abstract Models\nIn [8] and [9], an abstract model for the process of\nintrusion detection has been presented To make a better\nillustration, we summarize this abstract model in Fig. 2 \(a 


can be treated as a blackbox, and\nit accepts and analyzes an input data stream and generates\nalarms for potential attacks. We can model the input of an\nIDS as a random variable X that is composed of two values:\nN means no intrusion while I means there is an intrusion.\nSimilarly, the output of an IDS can also be modeled as a\nrandom variable Y , and it has another two values: N means\nno alarm while A means an alarm.\nWe assume the prior probability of an intrusion is P \(I  outputs of an IDS, we can therefore have four situations:\n• p\(Y = N |X = I there\nis no alarm when there is an intrusion.\n• p\(Y = N |X = N alarm when there is no intrusion.\n• p\(Y = A|X = I there is an intrusion.\n• p\(Y = A|X = N intrusion.\nSpeci?cally, p\(Y = N |X = I FN, denoted as Y = A|X = N the false\npositive rate \(FP, denoted as Y = N |X = N rate while p\(Y =\nA|X = I namely the detection\nrate evaluation dataset will be given\nin advance, so that we can compute B,? and ? based on\nthe ground truth.\nIn Fig. 2 \(b reduction at\nan abstract level, an alarm ?lter \(simply ?lter input alarm stream\nand identi?es false alarms. Similarly, we can model the input\nof the ?lter as a random variable X which has two values:\nN\nI\nX\n\(a b I I nP\(F F a b alarm detection \(reduction can be modeled as a random variable\nY that has two values: T means to classify as a true alarm\nwhile F means to classify as a false alarm.\nSimilarities. Based on these two abstract models, it is\nvisible that these two processes are similar. Therefore, we\ncan ?ne-tune and apply information-theoretic metric from\nintrusion detection to false alarm detection. There are also\nfour situations regarding the process of false alarm detection:\n• p\(Y = T |X = F Y T |X = T Y = F |X = F indicates the probability of\nclassifying a false alarm as a false alarm.\n• p\(Y = F |X = T probability of\nclassifying a true alarm as a false alarm.\nWe assume that the prior probability of a false alarm\nis P \(F Y = T |X = F negative rate \(FN,\ndenoted as ?f Y = F |X = T FP, denoted as ?f addition, p\(Y = T |X = T Y = F |X = F detection rate intrusion\ndetection to false alarm reduction. However, their application\nbackground may be a bit different:\n In the process of intrusion detection, its based rate B is\nvery slow in real environment \(e.g., 10?5 the\nprocess of false alarm reduction, the probability P \(F for an\nanomaly-based IDS \(e.g., 50% or even higher to ?nd the best operation point that can be achieved\nby the IDS in terms of its intrinsic ability. That is how\nto better con?gure an IDS. But for the intelligent false\nalarm reduction, the main purpose is to ?nd a more\nappropriate algorithm at a given time, based on the\nsame training data, without recon?guring this scheme.\n• A machine learning algorithm may have more outputs.\nFor example, WEKA platform [23] is widely used in\n243\nthe community of machine learning. It can output not\nonly true positive and false positive for an algorithm,\nbut also precision and recall.\nThese differences make the targets of the metric, which\nis used in the ?eld of intelligent IDS false alarm reduction,\na bit different from the process of intrusion detection.\nB Information Theoretic Metric: RCFA\nTo re?ne IDS false alarms through selecting the most\nappropriate algorithm in an adaptive way, the basic tech-\nnical challenge is how to appropriately evaluate different\nmachine learning algorithms. That is, the evaluation should\nfaithfully refer to the “truth” about the input alarms From\nan information-theoretic point of view, we should reduce the\nuncertainty about the input alarms if given the output.\nAccording to our established abstract model of false alarm\nreduction \(detection relationship as shown\nin Fig. 2, in this work, we propose an information theoretic\nmetric of False Alarm Reduction Capability \(RCFA the entropy of the input.\nDe?nition1: Let the random variable X denote the ?lter\ninput and the random variable Y denote the ?lter output.\nFalse Alarm Reduction Capability can be de?ned as:\nRCFA =\nI\(X;Y X X|Y  X 1  due\nto the similarities between two abstract models due to the differences be-\ntween application background 1 


information is normalized\nby the entropy of the input alarms. According to infor-\nmation theory, mutual information measures the reduction\nof uncertainty of the input alarms, while the entropy of\nthe input re?ects the original uncertainty. RCFA therefore\nmeasures the reduction of uncertainty of the ?lter input by\ngiving the ?lter output. Intuitively, a larger value of RCFA\nindicates that an algorithm has a better capability of correctly\nidentifying a false alarm.\nIV. ANALYSIS AND COMPARISON\nIn this section, we analyze several existing metrics re-\ngarding intelligent false alarm reduction, and describe the\ncalculation of the proposed RCFA.\nA Decision Value\nIn [17], an intuitive, single metric \(called decision value different machine learning\nschemes in the context of intelligent false alarm reduction,\nwhich can be represented as below:\ndecision value = 0.4× CA+ 0.6× PFA \(2 2 accuracy\nwhile PFA represents precision of false alarm. The de?ni-\ntions of these two measures are describes as below:\nCA =\nthe number of correctly classi?ed alarms\nthe number of total alarms\n\(3 false alarms classi?ed as false alarm\nthe number of alarms classi?ed as false alarm\n\(4 easily obtained by analyzing\nthe output of an algorithm. The pair of \(0.4, 0.6 17]. Generally, the equation \(2 5 above equation, W1 and W2 are two weight values.\nObviously, this metric of decision value is very subjective\nsince the weight value should be determined by a security\nof?cer in advance. In [17], the selected pair of \(0.4, 06 i.e keeping the ?ltration accuracy above 80 be decided by conducting experiments in advance, in\nwhich additional burden may be caused on a security of?cer.\nOn the whole, the construction of decision value may be\neffective in practice but is weak in theory.\nB. ROC Curve-based Measurement\nAn ROC \(receiver operating characteristic which illustrates the performance of a binary\nclassi?er system and each plot indicates the relationship\n\(fraction used for measuring IDSs\nunder one condition: if the ROC curves of the two IDSs\ndo not have a cross point i.e., one curve is always above\nthe other FP \(false positive true\npositive then\nthere is no easy way to compare the two or several IDSs.\nThat is, it is not appropriate to use the area under the ROC\ncurve \(AUC the above analysis\nof two abstract models \(see Fig. 2 curve to intelligent false alarm\nreduction \(i.e., measuring different algorithms the ?eld of intrusion detection,\nGaffney and Ulvila [5] combined ROC curves with cost anal-\nysis to compute an expected cost for each IDS. The expected\ncost can be computed for selecting the best operation point\nand be used to evaluate different IDSs. In [16], the metric of\nexpected cost was applied to evaluating different algorithms\nregarding intelligent false alarm reduction. To compute the\n244\nexpected cost, a cost ratio C is de?ned as C = C?/C?,\nwhere C? denotes the cost of identifying a false alarm as a\ntrue alarm while C? denotes the cost of identifying a true\nalarm as a false alarm. Both C? and C? are relative to\nthe cost of making a correct classi?cation. To reduce false\nalarms by means of different machine learning schemes, the\nexpected cost of any operating point can be decided by\nanalyzing a decision tree model [5, 16]. The equation of\ncomputing the expected cost is shown as below:\nCexp = min{C?fP, \(1? ?f 1? P 1? ?f 1? P  6 6 indicates\nthat the expected cost is the sum of the products of the\nprobabilities of the ?lter’s outputs and the expected costs\nconditional on the outputs. However, in real deployment,\nthe expected cost suffers some limitations. For instance, in\na realistic IDS operation environment [8], the base rate B\n\(namely P in the above equation e.g., 10?5  e.g., 10?3 negative rate e.g., 10?1 1 C?B + C\(1 rate and the false negative rate.\nTo resolve this problem, a metric of relative expected cost\n\(denoted as Crec  1? P 7 Crec is related to both false positive\nrate and false negative rate, and provides an prospective\nof cost analysis in evaluating distinct machine learning\nalgorithms on IDS false alarm reduction. But the same as\ndecision value, its construction still needs to be proved.\nIn addition, the cost ratio C \(where C = C?/C is a\nvery important factor in determining Crec whereas it is a\nsubjective measure that the cost should be decided by a\nsecurity of?cer. To conclude, the metric of Crec may be\nuseful in intelligent false alarm reduction, but it involves a\nsubjective parameter without a good analysis model so that\nit is sometimes hard 


to accurately estimate the cost ratio C.\nC. False Alarm Reduction Capability\nAs described above, false alarm reduction capability \(de-\nnote RCFA uncertainty of the ?lter input by giving the\n?lter output. That is, when we obtain the ?lter output, we can\nevaluate different algorithms in terms of their capability of\nreducing input’s uncertainty. Obviously RCFA has a strong\nbasis in theory as compared to the metrics of decision value\nand relative expected cost, and it is an objective metric\naccording to the equation \(1 calculation.\nIn addition, metrics of decision value, expected cost,\nrelative expected cost are all relative to false positive rate\n\(?f f  more sensitive to false positive\nrate and false negative rate. Referring to the above abstract\nmodels, we can infer that RCFA is also related and sensitive\nto ?f and ?f . Being sensitive means that a metric can re?ect\neven slight improvements \(regressions several different\nalgorithms even when they have very similar performance.\nTo conclude, the metric of RCFA has three major ad-\nvantages: 1 1 information theory; 2 more sensitive to the changes in\nfalse positive rate and false negative rate.\nTo compute RCFA, we present conditional probabilities\nof ?lter \(algorithm OUTPUT.\nFilter Report True Alarm \(X X Y Y addition, with regard to information theory, we can\nhave several equations shown as below [4]:\nP \(X|Y X Y |X Y 8 Y Xi Y |Xi 9 X|Y X = F |Y = F By\ncombining the equations \(8 9 X|Y X Y |X Xi Y |Xi 10 discussed above, we have known P \(X Y |X X|Y P \(F 1? ?f F 1? ?f 1?

In this section, we explore the performance\nof RCFA by comparing it with other metrics under three\nsimulated scenarios.\nDifferent from intrusion detection \(i.e., B is very slow F higher in real settings,\nespecially for an anomaly-based IDS. Thus, we simulate\nthree scenarios of false alarm rate to study the performance\nof RCFA as compared to the metrics of decision value and\nrelative expected cost.\nAs discussed in our previous work [17], we use the same\nmethod to construct three datasets by means of Snort alarms\nas below:\n• DATASET1: this dataset contains a total of 2142 alarms\nwith false alarm rate P \(F 0.3.\n• DATASET2: this dataset contains a total of 2142 alarms\nwith false alarm rate P \(F this dataset contains a total of 2142 alarms\nwith false alarm rate P \(F reasonable that nearly 2200 alarms\nare produced every day \(although the number of generated\nalarms may be about 1,000,000 in a large operational com-\npany [2], for our CSLab the number of produced alarms is\nabout 2000 per day 1:2,\n1:1 and 2:1 respectively. These datasets cover all possible\nsituations of false alarms in real deployment so that we can\nuse them to completely evaluate the performance of RCFA\nunder different scenarios \(the construction details of alarm\ndatasets can be referred to [17 of 7 spe-\nci?c algorithms provided by WEKA platform [23]: ZeroR,\nKNN \(IBK LibSVM SMO NaiveBayes, NN\n\(RBFNetwork J48 are widely utilized\nTable II\nPARAMETERS OF ALGORITHMS’ OUTPUTS.\nDATASET1 CA PFA ?f ?f\nZeroR 0.6536 0 0.654 0.346\nKNN \(IBK LibSVM SMO 0.297\nNaiveBayes 0.6867 0.628 0.526 0.313\nNN \(RBFNetwork J48 0.119\nDATASET2 CA PFA ?f ?f\nZeroR 0.5103 0.510 0.510 0.490\nKNN \(IBK LibSVM 0.8688 0.911 0.129 0.131\nSVM \(SMO RBFNetwork J48 0.665 0.665 0.335\nKNN \(IBK LibSVM SMO 0.668 0.650 0.338\nNaiveBayes 0.6447 0.67 0.624 0.355\nNN \(RBFNetwork J48 0.910 0.149 0.119\nin machine learning community, so that we can use it to\navoid any implementation bias.

These parameters \(e.g, CA, PFA, ?f , ?f all algorithms were\nused in default settings higher CA and a higher PFA,\nand have a lower ?f and a lower ?f .\nFluctuant Performance. As shown in Table II it is\nvisible that, for an algorithm, its performance varied with\ntraining datasets \(P \(F SMO for an exam-\nple, its classi?cation accuracy \(CA DATASET2.

The situation is the\nsame for the other two datasets. The results indicate that the\nmetrics of Crec and RCFA are better than decision value in\nre?ecting the intrinsic capability of an algorithm.\nSensitivity. As discussed above, being sensitive means\nthat a metric can re?ect even slight improvements \(or re-\ngressions algorithm. For different algorithms,\nthese two measures may change a bit. For example in\nDATASET1, the algorithm of KNN \(IBK Crec = 0.4007 and RCFA = 0.4626 LibSVM f = 0.118 and ?f = 0.119\n\(Crec = 0.3863 and RCFA = 0.48398 deviations regarding Crec and\nRCFA as below:\nDCrec = |\n0.4007? 0.3863\n0.4007\n| = 0.0359\nDRCFA = |\n0.48398 0.4626\n0.4626\n| = 0.0462\nIt is easily visible that DRCFA is larger than DCrec , the\nsituation is the same for other cases. The results verify the\nprevious analysis [8] that the metric of RCFA is sensitive to\nfalse positive rate and false negative rate, and also indicate\nthat RCFA is more sensitive than Crec. To conclude RCFA\nis an objective, single metric that provides a better view of\nevaluating different algorithms compared to decision value\nand Crec, in the context of ?f and ?f . In addition, RCFA\ncan better re?ect characteristics of a baseline algorithm \(e.g.,\nRCFA = 0 reducing false\nalarms. Lee and Stolfo [12] ?rst proposed a framework of\nusing data mining algorithms to deal with audits \(i.e., select-\ning and extracting features audit records. Then computational\nintelligence has become popular and widely used in the\nresearch community 24]. Pietraszek [20] described a system\ncalled ALAC \(Adaptive Learner for Alert Classi?cation false positives in intrusion detection, which supported\nthe human analyst by classifying alerts into true positives\nand false positives. The ALAC could effectively reduce the\nanalyst’s workload. Later, Alharby and Imai [1] proposed an\napproach for characterizing the “normal” stream of alarms\nby mining historical alarms and further developed an algo-\nrithm for detecting alarm anomalies by using continuous and\ndiscontinuous 


sequential patterns. Several other work can be\nreferred to [3, 6, 7, 11, 13, 18].\nEvery algorithm claims that they can achieve a better\noutput, but in real-world applications, their performance is\n?uctuant under different scenarios. In order to keep ?ltration\naccuracy at a high and stable level, Meng and Kwok 17]\nproposed an intelligent false alarm ?lter \(named intelligent\nfalse alarm reduction most appropriate\nmachine learning algorithm in an adaptive way, the ?lter can\novercome the ?uctuant performance of a single algorithm\nand provide a better ?ltration accuracy. However, a funda-\nmental problem is how to appropriately evaluate different\nalgorithms and determine the best one. In [17], a metric of\ndecision value was proposed but this metric is a subjective\nmetric without much theory support. Then, Meng [16 fur-\nther proposed a metric of relative expected cost in intelligent\nfalse alarm reduction to evaluate an algorithm. But the metric\n247\nof relative expected cost still contains a subjective parameter\n\(cost ratio its calculation.\nNote that these existing metrics are useful in practice, but\nit is still desirable to have an objective metric in resolving the\nabove fundamental problem and better evaluating different\nalgorithms according to their intrinsic capabilities of identi-\nfying a false alarm. In this work, we therefore propose an\ninformation-theoretic metric of false alarm reduction capa-\nbility \(RCFA alarm reduction,\nwhich can complement existing metrics in evaluating an\nalgorithm’s inherent capability of identifying false alarms.\nVII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\nThe technique of intelligent IDS false alarm reduction\naims to maintain ?ltration accuracy at a high and stable level,\nhowever, a fundamental problem is how to appropriately and\nobjectively evaluate the performance of different algorithms.\nIn this paper, we attempt to propose an information-\ntheoretic metric of false alarm reduction capability \(RCFA this fundamental problem. In particular, we ?rst\nidentify the relationship between the process of intrusion\ndetection and the process of false alarm detection \(reduction abstract models. By un-\nderstanding these models \(e.g., similarities, differences information theory in computing the metric\nof RCFA, which is the ratio of the mutual information\nbetween the algorithm input and output to the entropy of\nthe input alarm. Later, we explore the performance of RCFA\nunder three scenarios. The experimental results under three\nscenarios show that RCFA is more sensitive to false positive\nrate and false negative rate than other existing metrics such\nas decision value and relative expected cost, and that RCFA\ncan provide a better, more accurate decision.\nOur work is an early work in discussing the measurement\nof intelligent false alarm reduction from a viewpoint of\ninformation theory. Future work could include extending the\ncalculation of RCFA using channel capacity models from\ninformation theory \(e.g., Markov chain intelligent false alarm reduction.

stability \(standard deviation, tail percen-\ntile, PI multiple scenarios or system designs. This is an \narea in which our reporting is particularly weak. Even the formal statistical comparisons we provide typi-\ncally focus on a single measure, and nearly always compare means rather than measures of risk.  \nThis list of analytics challenges is not exhaustive, but it is a good start. We are currently giving simulation \nusers amazing tools for generating data, but not nearly as much help in getting the most out of these data.  \n7 CONCLUSIONS \nThis paper has continued the discussion of Grand Challenges in M&S by discussing these from an Opera-\ntional Research/Management Science \(OR/MS It has discussed themes including simulation \nin healthcare, value of information, data modeling, stochastic modeling and optimization, agent-based \nsimulation and simulation analytics. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThe work described in C.

introduced SALSA, an approach to automatically\nanalyze Hadoop logs to construct state-machine views of the\nplatform’s execution [25]. The derived state-machines are used\nto trace the data-flow and control-flow executions. SALSA\ncomputes the histograms of the durations of each state and uses\nthese histograms to estimate the Probability Density Functions\n\(PDFs between the PDFs across machines to detect\nanomalies. Tan et al. also compare the duration of a state\nin a particular node with its past PDF to determine if the\nduration exceeds a determined threshold and can be flagged\nas an anomaly.\nAnother related work to this paper is the approach of Xu\net al. in [26], which uses the source code to understand the\nstructure of the logs. They create features based on the constant\nand variable parts of the log messages and apply the Principal\nComponent Analysis \(PCA behaviour.\nAll the above approaches are all designed for system\nadministrators in managing their large clusters. Our approach,\non the other hand, aims to assist developers in comparing the\ndeployed system on such large clusters against the develop-\nment cloud.\nX. CONCLUSION\nDevelopers of BDA Apps typically first develop their appli-\ncation with a small sample of data in a pseudo cloud, then\ndeploy the application in a large scale cloud environment.\nHowever, the larger data and more complex environments\nlead to unexpected executions of the underlying platform.\nSuch unexpected executions and their context cannot be easily\nuncovered by traditional approaches.\nIn this paper, we propose an approach to uncover the\ndifferent behaviour of the underlying platforms for BDA Apps\nbetween runs with small testing data and large real-life data\nin a cloud environment. To evaluate our approach, we perform\na case study on Hadoop, a widely used platform, with three\nBDA Apps. The case study results show the strength of our\napproach in two aspects:\n1 drastically reduces the verification effort\nby 86-97% when verifying the deployment of BDA\nApps in the cloud.\n2 the prob-\nlematic logs reported by our approach are much fewer\nthan using keyword search, which makes it possible to\nmanually explore the problematic logs.\nIn addition, our approach provides additional context informa-\ntion \(execution sequences sequences of the logs to\nrapidly understand the cause of problematic log lines.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
