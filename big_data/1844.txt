Computerisation, Data Privacy and Scientific Excellence Where are e Going Damir Kalpi Department of Applied Computing Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing Unska 3, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia damir.kalpic@fer.hr Abstract  Computerisation of most human activities that handle data is widely in function nowadays. General fears of Big Brother syndrome are ubiquitous. The paper attempts to challenge this common wisdom by demonstrating on some examples how computerisation in connection with proclaimed data privacy politics actually hinders the useful information, some of which was even formerly available, without computerisation or in older information system versions before the current rigid data privacy legislation. Examples are taken primarily from some personal author’s experience and from information systems aimed for academic community in Croatia, developed at the author’s Department. Data privacy prevents ordinary members of the academic community or society from proper investigation that could challenge the adequacy of existing policies. At the same time, the persons who institutionally have granted access to the collected information and who are the most influential to conduct policies have hardly time to do so Keywords Personal identification number Identity fraud, Risk, Student administration Subsidised nourishment, Academic achievement 1. Introduction This invited paper offers the author a possibility to share with the audience some his first-hand experience in order to challenge some seemingly generally accepted threats, like disclosure of private data through computerisation. The famous personification of the ubiquitous presence of data collectors and abusers is named Big Brother after the Orwell’s character in his well known futuristic novel 1984 However, these widely expressed fears are in contradiction to the popularity of the equally named TV reality show where some irrelevant individuals perform some irrelevant activities while being thoroughly watched by wide enthusiastic audience who find inexplicable joy in watching someone’s alleged privacy. The press is overwhelmed with gossip and stories from private life of so called celebrities. This information is of no use to anyone, except that it can ruin someone’s life. This duality of human character is appropriately exploited by so called data privacy activists. How much the transparency and tax payers’ rights are endangered by hiding information which is of our common concern, is hardly ever asked On the other hand, overwhelming computerisation allows for providing to worldwide audience the measures of scientific activity for any scientifically active individual whether s/he likes it or not. Under circumstances of scientific overproduction and overflow of publications, some measures have been introduced to help reduce the noise. However these indices aimed for readers, have turned into major factors for evaluation of individual scientific excellence. This attitude shall be under scrutiny in this paper The topics are considered thanks to the author’s experience regarding the abolition of the Personal Identification Number in Croatia development at his Department of two nationwide information systems to support higher education and through his recurring duty of evaluation of his peers’ proposals and performance for their re-election or promotion 2. Personal Identification Number In early 1970-ties the introduction of Unique Citizen’s Identification Number started as an answer to requirements of early computerisation efforts. At that time, no computer networks were available, so that rules regarding the construction of that number had to enable its creation locally The number was determined to be 13 digits long It started with the date of birth, where the year 89 Proceedings of the ITI 2008 30 th Int. Conf. on Information Technology Interfaces June 23-26, 2008, Cavtat, Croatia 


was presented by 3 digits, so it was not affected by the Y2K problem. Locality of birth code and sex code followed, ending with a serial number of the individual in the local birth registry. The last digit was a control one, calculated modulo 11. In the years to come, this number has become the commonly accepted unique key to identify the citizens. In 2002 the Croatian Parliament in a poor and misunderstood imitation of foreign practice, pretending to protect data privacy brought a legal act practically abolishing the use of that allegedly “all-revealing” number. There were reasonable voices in the Parliament to object this Act but they were overridden by the computer-illiterate majority. An exchange of existing personal documents followed, having the number removed The legislators did not bother to consult profession. Afterwards, the author was engaged by the Government in a group of about 40 professionals from different fields to solve the problem how to proceed further without the Unique Personal Identification Number. After having achieved the e-mail addresses of all the Group members, the author sent them a longer email message explaining that this number was used as a substitute primary key instead of the imperfect combination of family and personal names, extended by the date and place of birth and father’s name; as it had been usual beforehand. The author pleaded for withdrawal of the Act instead of trying to find solutions to an unnecessarily provoked problem. He also offered a modest financial reward to any information that anyone could obtain from his Personal Id, except his date of birth, place of birth and sex. After these mailings, the Group was never convened again. The author had an opportunity to criticise the Act at an open public discussion, in a radio talk and in form of an interview in the major daily newspaper [1  In this interview h e  admitted that the Personal Id does unnecessarily reveal a personal information – date of birth which was inevitable due to the technology available when it had been introduced. He proposed, if necessary, but hardly as a priority, a one time substitution with non-revealing numbers. The efforts of some other individuals and organisations, like the Banking union also were in wane. The existing documents were substituted with useless ones. The citizens had to provide other documents as statehood certificate or birth certificate and/or to carry with them the old voided documents in order to prove their identity The Act has made it easier to steal identity or to hide own wrongdoing. Data privacy activists were happy to deprive the banks of a unique person’s identification. This made possible to a person deeply in debt and unable to repay it, to get another loan in another bank and double the damage. The banks’ normal reaction would be to increase the interest rates for loans as result of increased risk.  Honest citizens can be punished due to villains. Eventually, the banks reintroduced the use of Personal Id. At first, it occurred “voluntarily”. A person, who would not submit it, would not be considered for a loan Afterwards, the banks did not have to fear because the very Ministry of finance required the Personal Id for taxation purposes. Some other institutions were damaged. The author had the opportunity to witness it at a Croatian state agency which had problems to collect some fees from land owners who were not uniquely identifiable. There were identity frauds where a person was selling someone else’s real estates due to increased mess in cadastre and even more so in land registry To be fair, one must admit that even some honest people could take advantage of the Act, as illustrated in the following story The author’s colleague in rush to a business meeting had parked his car in the city centre at a prohibited place. After the meeting, his car was not there, obviously towed away by the communal service, just as he expected. He went to the tow lot to pay the fine and take his car back. The car was not there. There was no information about having towed away his car The author’s colleague went back to the position he had parked the car in order to call the police and report his car stolen. But his car was back there! How come? The author’s colleague bears the same personal and family name as the newly appointed minister of transportation at that time While checking the car owner without the Personal Identification Number, one confounded the author’s colleague with his boss, the new minister. The reaction was quite expected In the end of the day, this year, the so called Personal Taxation Number is to be introduced. It will not reveal any personal information but it will completely assume and extend the role of the former Personal Id. Nobody officially admits that it could have been done immediately, as the author proposed in [1  Nobody in author s knowledge, at least until now, has come to the idea to complain about the endangered personal data privacy introduced through this new 90 


number. The author wonders if some data privacy activists could miss such a splendid opportunity to let themselves heard. Ignorant technophobes may again raise their voices against the “all revealing number”, while if somebody bears a rare, uncommon name, which also uniquely identifies a person, nobody objects The unhappy ones among honest citizens are actually those who have very common names and are often confounded with someone else 3 Subsidized nourishment of students Ministry of Science and Technology at the end of the last century faced an annoying problem. In major student feeding facilities or students’ restaurants, food stamps were issued to students after a payment. The students were using these stamps to pay for their meals and the Ministry had subsidized this activity. It can be easily devised that the Ministry was paying also when nobody did actually eat and the subsidising money was split between student and the restaurant In order to avoid the misuse in this activity with the budget larger than the University’s, the Ministry financed the project of a computerised system for management of students’ nourishment based on a sort of credit cards issued to students 3 stem h a s been successfully put into function and it is still running. One of the aims of the system was to detect inappropriate use of subsidise. Statistics showed some abnormality in the distribution of consumption. Some students did not use the system for what it was designed to enable them regular convenient and appropriate food. Instead they were buying resalable packed products like juices, packages of e.g. 27 puddings or yoghurts etc. The developers of the system organised web sites where such abuses were made public. On the other hand, the system could reveal the cashiers who were selling such packages with no questions asked. Very soon, revealing of this information was banned by the Ministry because it would offend the abusers’ rights”. So, the abuses persist, probably lower than before the system introduction, but they still represent a misuse of the taxpayers’ money and encourage socially unacceptable behaviour among the student population. Taxation money is used partially to support fraud.  Honest students appear to be fools for not enjoying fully the beauty” of the system 4. Student Administration Software The tradition of developing software to support student administration is rather long 4    u t each versi on was beco ming ever  more restrictive following the legal regulations The last version [8  aim e d for the higher education in the whole country is strictly obeying the data privacy rules in order to satisfy the most restrictive user. How restrictive a user can be illustrates the recorded case of legal suite of a professor against his colleague because he had examined the accuser’s student in a course they commonly taught. Beforehand, some analyses, if even in their initial stage, had been preformed in order to try to find some behavioural patterns of students and educators [9  Now, thanks to an unfortunate appeasement to pusillanimous behaviour of some faculty members already at the time of the former software version and due to fear from being accused for breaching the data privacy, excessive limitations have been introduced. The data privacy enforcement is omnipresent. The mentor of a student can only observe the grades his student has achieved in the mentor’s courses and the overall average grade. Whether his or her student is more inclined towards mathematically oriented courses or hardware or software or social sciences whether the student is a regular one or a notorious repeater, remains for the mentor a mystery. The mentor is also supposed to advise his mentored students regarding the enrolment in elective courses. Publicly visible, there exist the contents of each course. The professors are obliged to enter also the time plan for weeks of educational activities, but as they do not see it immediately, it is understandable that they are reluctant to do it, or they use alternative means to expose it. Even if the very precise educational schedule and contents of an elective course were available, it is not enough. The course quality and attractiveness heavily depend upon the execution. There are regular anonymous students’ evaluations of educators, three times per course, for each course separately [2  Th e deviation from data secrecy is in the fact that all the educators in the same course can see each other’s scores. The written students’ comments are hidden, except to the educator in question what is appropriate because the comments can sometimes be singular no justified attacks, while the scores are of statistical nature and represent fairly the audience’s opinion. Still the 91 


information among all the teachers is not revealed This is a giant leap forward in comparison to recent times when the educators were untouchable”. The author remembers how the first attempts of these enquires were abolished as it turned out that a certain professor’s lectures ranked as “hardly understandable”. For the author and his team who provided software, that outcome had been the best proof that the software performs correctly! Now, this secrecy appears to be very humane towards the educators. It certainly is. However, what about the students? A mentor can advise them only according to some gossip to avoid certain educators. Is it correct, or it might be protracting prejudice The students who prolong their study excessively are required to pay tuition. Their parents are eager to know what they are paying for. Is their descendant in the first or in the last year of study, or somewhere in between? The same can be said for the taxpayers and for all the students because even if tuition paid, it is only a fraction of the real costs. The majority of the costs are still covered by the taxpayers’ money The spending per student differs heavily among faculties and their source is far from transparent At once, the results of examinations have become a secret, although there has been in the university regulations since ancient times that the examinations are public. The author’s Faculty is an institution that boasts with its acknowledged quality, it is the only Croatian faculty to be internationally accredited and it is notoriously free of bribery, as different enquiries among the University students had demonstrated. One of its prides is the long tradition of entrance examination process consisting of performance in the secondary school and achievements at the entrance examination Am ong other things  it is made public how many credits a candidate has brought from the secondary school and what were his or her achievements at the examination Recently the Croatian Personal Data Protection Agency tried to convince the author’s institution to hide all the data regarding the entrance examination and to reveal only the personal result to each candidate. Of course, this could open unlimited opportunity to fraud and arbitrary behaviour. Decades of building confidence and eliminating of any possibility for bribery or corruption were invested in order to acquire the status of a fair and trustworthy institution for students, since the very beginning, since their entrance examination. A civil servant tried to endanger it, wishing desperately to find some argument for the Agency’s existence. In accordance to the Bologna process, the examinations are being performed simultaneously, in large groups and homework has been introduced. All this is applicable under presumption that the students would not be cheating, what is absolutely understandable at any renowned university in the world. Our students had to sign statement obliging them not to breach these regulations. However, recently a few students were caught to be cheating without any doubt. The Faculty decided to announce their misdeeds in public as a warning that an expulsion may follow. This act has caused incredibly fierce reaction from the media and from the data privacy protectionists. They regarded it as an intolerable abuse of data privacy. It has remained unclear what would they suggest instead – expulse the students silently, so that no one knows and can experience it only if caught in the same criminal activity; or should these students have obtained a special reward for cheating? The Student Administration Software collects interesting and useful data. Only a fraction of it is ever used or reviewed thanks to data privacy enforcement. The very few who are entitled to examine the data, can hardly find time, motivation or competence to do it Therefore, the whole system, developed and deployed after substantial efforts and invested competence, is reduced to a few very ordinary administrative functions, performed just because they are a duty. If there is no feedback to the data one enters, there is not much enthusiasm left among the educators for filling in, less than while filling in a taxation claim Who benefits from the data privacy in stateowned public universities? Before the Bologna process analyses regarding examiners’ attitudes could have been interesting. Nowadays, the examiners have little to say. The grades are derived from the credits achieved in continuous mostly written examinations and are interpreted after the ECTS rules, according to the Gaussian distribution. What remains to be seen are the individual students’ grades. Who are the best who fair, mediocre or poor? Wouldn’t it be interesting for the industry to have access to these data in order to offer scholarships not only to the best and the brightest, but also to those who may fit best their needs? Data privacy protects these students from such offers Actually, hardly anybody knows who the really 92 


good students are. The overall average mark does not reveal everything. Some who have very high marks in all courses are not apt for every job. It is also interesting to know whether the grades have been achieved in first trial or after multiple repetitions. Employers cannot offer adequate salaries to newly graduated ones taking into account also their academic performance, in comparison with the others. The employers or professionals from industry and business act sometimes as guest lecturers in some practically oriented courses in order to reveal their professional experience. In this way they risk to be accused for revealing some of their business secrets for the sake of spreading knowledge However, if they ask their host at the Faculty for information about students they could recruit they are turned down due to data secrecy. Who benefits? Benefit the students who protract their study endlessly, or pretend to be excellent while being mediocre. They are supported by taxpayers and by their parents, presenting them false or no data at all. Good students are punished while the worst are rewarded Finally, there is a very recent example of a received e-mail, the author could not answer without trespassing the ruling official secrecy.

Scientific excellence In very contradiction to the above mentioned proceedings in the Croatian higher education and public life, so called measures of scientific excellence are sometimes, but not consequently widely accessible The Rugjer Bošovi scientific institute in Zagreb has developed and maintains the Croatian Scientific Bibliography \(CROSBI\abase. It is a very useful application which should have, but it has not, avoided the need to re-declare the same data in different occasions, like promotion application for scientific projects, applications for scientific novices etc. Everybody can observe someone’s achievements and conclude about competences thereafter. Any change of data requires authentication and authorisation, exactly as it should be On the other hand, the Croatian Ministry of Science, Education and Sports maintains the Registry of Scientists in Croatia. The data privacy is very strongly enforced so that the only information one can obtain is the Personal Scientist’s Id if the user submits the person’s personal and family name and the date of birth This information is generally useless except for administration purposes where in some reports and applications this number is required. It serves to nothing because not even the scientific status of the person gets revealed. However, for some administrative purposes a certificate that one is in some scientific status can be required According to regulations, as published on the Ministry’s Web, such a certificate can be issued to a scientist after a written request. The author has recently submitted such a request, and as he received it a month and a half later, it was no more useful for him. The author often acted as referee for someone’s election or promotion, for evaluation of scientific projects and programs for evaluation of proposals of study, for evaluation of proposals for establishment of new institutions etc. The main factor in all these considerations is the people who should perform No information about them was available from the Register, initially envisaged as the main and trustworthy source of information. Data privacy hindered practical use of it. The referee can rely only on the data that the proponents have submitted about themselves. Some guilt for the criticised Register may be with the author of this paper who was engaged in the computerisation project for this Register. He should have maybe influenced its more appropriate fate 93 


Worldwide, information about scientists is widely accessible in scientific indices. The most famous one, the Current Contents, was envisaged to help the readers find relevant stuff under conditions of overproduction of scientific articles. In the meantime, much of the world academic community, have become addicts of scientomerics. The scientometric indices were not intended for the purpose of personal evaluations and the proof of someone’s identity does not exist. The author can find in famous Ovid under “Kalpic, D” only his references There is another Kalpic, “Kalpic B”, unrelated and personally not known to the author, but who publishes in a close field as the author of this paper If his name had started also with “D”, the author \(and his counterpart\y enjoy a higher reputation in some scientific circles! The information which is public is misused for the purpose it was not foreseen for A wider discussion about the criteria for academic promotion deserves another paper. In brief, the author strongly believes that exclusive insistence on scientometric quantifiers is contra productive, driving some of the best & brightest towards irrelevant, but easy to publish niches of science 6. Possible further developments If the data secrecy is rigidly enforced further on, there will be someone to fill the gap, mostly with disinformation, of course. Nowadays, junk mail arrives in hundreds messages per day to those of us who have our e-mail addresses openly exposed. These are well known non customised messages related to easy money, sex medications or replica watches. The sources of these fraudulent messages seem to be uncontrollable. It is conceivable that someone can on order  ”customise” such messages and send abusive contents regarding some person to many addresses. This could become a blackmailing instrument under circumstances that there were no publicly available sources of correct personal information. Recently, at the author’s institution some alleged student posted on the Web the story about a professor being permanently drunk. The professor in question is an extremely sober and morally straight person but he was still injured by such accusations. How come that he was so wrongly accused? His family name can be reduced to a nickname meaning “cork” in Croatian. Someone who had only heard that nickname invented and posted the rest Junk mail and viruses have deteriorated our life on-line. The same can be expected to happen with disinformation. When it comes to absurdity the legislators will have to admit their error and revoke the unnecessary information ban. It would be better if this can occur before too much damage has been done 7. Conclusion Data privacy policies should be seriously reconsidered, not only in Croatia. Outcomes of public education, paid by taxpayers’ money should be equally transparent to citizens like the results of scientific production which is often financed in the same way Internationally recognised scientific indices widely open to public, should be used primarily as a valuable tool for information retrieval rather than measure of someone’s scientific excellence Lack of reliable information can lead to disinformation and harm principally the correct citizens The author might have been too provocative self-centred and abusive for an invited speaker Nevertheless, the author strongly believes that at least some of his hypotheses do have foundation and he would be more than happy if this article could make any contribution to future improvements, or if a discussion could convince him that he was wrong. If proven to be wrong there will be still time enough to prevent broadcasting the Peking 2008 Olympic Games results in public. The competitors’ data privacy rights would be best protected if they were the only ones to know their own results 8.

  may capitalise on their opportunities offered by LGA initiatives \(e.g. e-Government\se then they may efficiently interact with their citizens and other stakeholders on a consistent basis w e v e r EAI is an emerging area within LGAs, thus, there remains an absence of theoretical models, which means there is still a case for the identification of factors that affect the decision making process for EAI adoption and identification of adoption lifecycle phases, with the development of empirically validated underpinnings argued, justified and presented in this paper. The authors sought to address the established voids by proposing a novel conceptual model for EAI adoption in LGAs. The model takes into consideration the parame ters that were identified in the normative literature as influencing factors and adoption lifecycle phases. The proposed conceptual model is novel as it includes: \(a\e model consists of a set of factors influencing EAI adoption in LGA_A and incorporates factors identified separately in previous studies. These factors are used for the developing an EAI adoption model in LGAs, \(b\e model incorporates adoption lifecycle phases Empirical findings illustrate that LGA_A passed through these phases while adopting EAI, \(c\e model assimilates the mapping of factors influencing EAI adoption in LGA_A on the adoption lifecycle phases, and \(d\e model incorporates the prioritisation \(importance\ EAI adoption factors in LGA_A on the adoption lifecycle phases The model can be used as a tool for decisionmaking to support LGAs and allow decision makers and researchers to understand and analyse EAI adoption. The concepts of the proposed model can be used for the adoption of inter-organisational IS since such systems should focus on integrated technologies and infrastructures. An interpretive, qualitative case study approach was selected to conduct this research It is not the intention of this paper to offer prescriptive guidelines to EAI adoption but rather describe case study perspectives that allow other researchers to relate their experiences to those reported. Hence, offering a broader understanding of the phenomenon of EAI adoption in LGAs Therefore, the lessons learnt are a result of the description provided and do not seek to be prescriptive. These lessons are summarised below Lesson 1 The practical implications of the mapping of factors on adoption lifecycle phases are  this process can support in better understanding the factors influencing EAI adoption in LGAs. This is vital as it can also support the managements  decision-making process while introducing EAI Lesson 2 Prioritising the importance of EAI adoption factors on adoption lifecycle phases can further enhance the decision making process in LGAs. During the mapping of factors, the importance of factors was not recognised Prioritising the factors can assist LGA officials in realising and understanding the factors influencing EAI adoption in LGAs Lesson 3 Findings on the mapping of factors and prioritising the importance of factors on adoption lifecycle phases reflect that each interviewee from LGA_A has relatively different conception while mapping the factors and prioritising the importance of factors on adoption lifecycle phases. This may also illustrate that within different LGAs interviewees understanding, knowledge and ability to comprehend the importance of factors may differ Lesson 4 Findings related to the mapping of factors and prioritising the importance of factors cannot be generalised as they may also differ from one LGA to the other Hitherto, the authors highlighted the individual elements of the contributions and research novelty presented in this paper. However, at the wider context this research aimed to enhance the technical decision making process while adopting EAI technologies in LGAs. This was achieved by proposing and validating a novel model \(Figure 1 for EAI adoption in the practical arena \(LGA_A The key beneficiaries are the decision makers and practitioners within LGAs, and researchers within the academic community. All of these benefit from the research in this paper as a guideline to analyse and understand EAI adoption in LGAs. In doing so this research work significantly contributes to the body of knowledge and practice in the areas of EAI and the local government domain by providing sufficient support to the decision makers in speeding up the EAI adoption process in LGAs   7.

Figure 9 also highlights the difficulty in designing a dynamic algorithm that is stable for most network configurations For data point 5 and 9 jitter is difficult to predict based on the AR PRESET This variability is most likely a result of the tolerance mechanism presenting artifacts during certain network configurations If the algorithm chooses too aggressively for too many data flows the contention parameters are set more aggressively and performance in the network suffers Although jitter remains better than NoDiff for all data points in Figure 9 providing more consistent behavior should be a primary goal for future versions of the AA SD Video Jitter 0.07 0.06 0.05  0.04  0.03 0.02 0.01 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Number of VCT and TS Nodes Figure 10 SD Video Jitter The average jitter for SD video is shown in Figure 10 This data represents a lower priority level and as compared to voice jitter in Figure 9 is able to provide better predictability The data still shows that performance for AA experiences greater variability than Normal but over most data points is better than both NoDiff and Normal HD video performance is similar to SD but has greater overall jitter and is therefore not shown Telemetry Jitter o 045 o 04 4 NoDiff Normal 0 035 AA 0 03 025 0  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Number of VCT Nodes 11 0.015 0.01 0.0050 Figure 11 Telemetry Jitter In Figure 11 which shows the jitter for Telemetry the data exhibits similar characteristics as the data for voice jitter Due to inconsistencies in the settling of the algorithm performance does not follow the same curve as NoDiff or Normal however for most data points the performance is better than NoDiff Figure 12 Command Round Trip Time The RTT for Command data is shown in Figure 12 Similar conclusions can be drawn from this data as have been discussed previously This data also exhibits greater variability than Normal and better overall performance than NoDiff The behavior of AA closely resembles that of AA in Figure 11 which reinforces the conclusion that the builtin hysteresis of the algorithm does not fully accommodate all network configurations Overall the Adaptive Algorithm is able to meet its goals of being a distributed way to dynamically manage priority and still perform similarly to static prioritization and better than no differentiation at all The self correcting characteristic of the algorithm leads to increased variability in performance which in some cases such as extreme network load causes the Adaptive Algorithm to perform significantly worse than static prioritization On the other hand network throughput is improved when the network is under-utilized because the Adaptive Algorithm is only engaged when performance requirements are not being met When viewed as a trade-off between simplicity of deployment and performance benefits over non-prioritized networks the Adaptive Algorithm can provide significant value to network architects and TS 


9 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK We have presented an extension to 802.1l e that dynamically adapts the contention parameters to meet performance requirements of lunar communications We have explored the capacity of 802.1lg using dynamic 802.1le to handle VoIP command telemetry and video according to their respective QoS requirements The data presented here shows that the Adaptive Algorithm can be deployed in these scenarios to effectively manage priority without a complicated centralized infrastructure This capability will be essential for short-range lunar communications in that quick deployment will be a primary goal The prevalence of 802.11 hardware and the possibility of the 2.4GHz band to perform at long and short ranges make it a viable option for future lunar networks However priority will be a necessity especially if the network carries non-critical traffic alongside mission-critical VoIP and data Future work on the algorithm will include improvement to the tolerance mechanism to reduce added contention from over-adjustment It is possible that more testing with more conservative settings will result in less variable network conditions at the expense of faster convergence Although we feel that the algorithm presented here is important we believe it is not the total solution It has been shown in previous works that in general 802.1 le increases contention in the network which results in overall lower throughput The Adaptive Algorithm does alleviate this disadvantage for some scenarios but not all Other works show that 802.1 le under the HCCA can solve the problem of throughput at the expense of simplicity and rapid deployment Therefore we expect that many 802.11 e deployments will use a mix of pure EDCA and HCCA in addition to using EDCA as a backup measure for HCCA Having an efficient and simple way to use ECDA will provide network architects with greater flexibility and will further reduce dependence on proprietary network design as we move towards expansion beyond the Earth 10 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The research described in this paper was carried out at Clemson University under the South Carolina Space Grant Consortium Research and Education Awards Program REAP and at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 1 ANSI/IEEE Std 802.1 lb 1999 Edition IEEE Standard for Information technologyTelecommunications and Information exchange between systems Local and metropolitan area networks Specific requirements Part 11 IEEE 1999 2 ANSI/IEEE Std 802.1 le 1999 Edition IEEE Standard for Information technologyTelecommunications and Information exchange between systems Local and metropolitan area networks Specific requirements Part 11 Amendment 8 IEEE 1999 3 Wi-Fi CERTIFIED for WMM Support for Multimedia Applications with Quality of Service in Wi-Fi Networks Wi-Fi Alliance September 1 2004 4 Swaminathan Arvind and James Martin 2006 Fairness Issues in Hybrid 802.1 lb/e Networks Consumer Communications and Networking Conference 2006 3rd IEEE Vol 1 Issue 8-10 50-54 5 Wietholter Sven and Hoene Christian 2003 Design and Verification of an IEEE 802.1 le EDCA Simulation Model in ns-2.26 TKN Technical Report Series Technical University Berlin November 2003 6 Cali F M Conti E Gregori 2000 Dynamic Tuning of the IEEE 802.11 Protocol to Achieve a Theoretical Throughput Limit IEEE/ACM Transactions On Networking Vol 8 No 6 December 2000 785-799 7 Cali F M Conti E Gregori 2000 IEEE 802.11 Protocol Design and Performance Evaluation of an Adaptive Backoff Mechanism IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications Vol 18 No 9 September 8 Chen D S Garg M Kappes K Trivedi 2002 Supporting VBR VoIP Traffic in IEEE 802.11 WLAN in PCF Mode Center for Advanced Computing and Communications ECE Department Duke University Durham NC Avaya Labs Research New Jersey 9 Siris Vasilios and Stamatakis George 2006 Optimal CWmin Selection for Achieving Proportional Fairness in Multi-Rate 802.1 le WLANs Test-bed Implementation and Evaluation International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking WiNTECH 06 10 He Dajiang and Charles Shen 2003 Simulation Study of IEEE 802.1l e EDCA Vehicular Technology Conference Spring 2003 Vol 1 685-689 12 ILREFERENCES

14 is particularly challenging It is noteworthy that these translations may well be haptic and audible as well as visual A final building block for the disseminated user interface is the development of advanced packaging techniques for assembly of the HSI components into sufficiently small packages that may be unobtrusively introduced into crew quarters and crew clothing so that their use requires little or no special setup before operation Power sources and lightweight batteries would be needed as well compatible with the spacecraft environment Changing your shirt may also change your batteries for the wearable sensors Intelligent agents are a focus for many of the activities of the Intelligent Systems Division at NASA Ames Several demonstrations of early prototypes have been performed so this area is considered one for development rather than just research 7. C ONCLUSIONS Inflatable spacecraft represent a revolutionary way of creating viable living and operations volume for humans engaged in exploration missions providing increased usable volume with reduced launch mass and volume They can potentially increase resistance to micrometeorite and space radiation hazards over conventional aluminum structures while being more flexible for reconfiguration from transit to habitat modes Challenges maintaining avionics operation during dynamic changes from stowed to deployed state during inflation providing feedthroughs between the inner and outer surface of the pressure vessel and for monitoring the health of the inflatable fabric itself can be met by applying innovations in the areas of avionics architecture intelligent sensors, human-system interfaces and spacecraft information interaction, currently in the research and development phase These innovations leverage the capabilities of each other to provide new concepts for the operation of long duration human spacecraft MAA is based on a massively redundant peer-to-peer construct providing much higher fault tolerance and higher computational performance Intelligent sensors have the potential for dramatically reducing sensor failures and inaccuracies again by employing many redundant elements with internal cross-checking of function and accuracy MAA directly supports roaming mobile HSI and its excess computational power can be used for hosting intelligent agent technology for information management and access The use of wireless networks and wireless power distribution directly supports inflatable spacecraft by eliminating inflexible cables and feedthroughs across the pressure vessel An innovative operations concept for transit vehicle piloting operation and maintenance was outlined incorporating these technologies providing virtual cockpits for vehicle operation, augmented reality for complex support activities and unobtrusive interfaces for common activities Design guidelines for constructing such HSI systems were presented consistent with current human factors practice The use of intelligent agents nicely complements advanced HSI allowing natural interaction between crew and spacecraft systems and payloads, effectively increasing crew size Technology for implementing proof-of-concept prototypes already exists Significant improvement in performance power consumption size mass and cost are required for all elements but are anticipated to be achieved using modern semiconductor advances Packaging and hardening for the space environment will remain serious challenges Critical advances in software architecture and algorithms will be needed to integrate these widely dispersed assets into a coherent system capable of maintain function despite failures and changing mission conditions In many ways the system architecture described is a good host for developing and testing many advanced software concepts Agent-based design in general may help coordinate many of the loosely-coupled modules and functions identified Successful implementation of this architecture and complementary features can lead to more robust inflatable spacecraft, increasing the performance and capabilities of the spacecraft and its crew during the conduct of exploration missions to the moon and Mars

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
