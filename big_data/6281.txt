Big Data in Smart Cities From Poisson to Human Dynamics Antonio J Jara Dominique Genoud Yann Bocchi Institute of Business Information Systems University of Applied Sciences Western Switzerland HES-SO Sierre Switzerland jara@ieee.org f dominique.genoud yann.bocchi g hevs.ch Abstract Big Data is conceived as the powerful tool to exploit all the potential of the Internet of Things and the Smart Cities Historically several of the human-related behaviours have been modelled with Poisson distribution but a new dimension of understanding about the human behaviours is reached through all the gathered data in the emerging smart environment This work analyses the data from the European Project SmartSantander This work has correlated the traf\002c behaviour with respect to the temperature in the Santander City This has been presented as the evolution of both 003ows present a similar behaviour The traf\002c distribution aggregated by temperature bins follows up a Poisson distribution model Thereby allowing interpolate and predict complex behaviours based on simple measures such as the temperature At the same time this data presents a burst behaviour human dynamics when the data is analysed in sequence instead of aggregated by temperature bins Therefore this work concludes that human-related behaviours can be described with both Poisson and Human Dynamics distribution depending on how the data is represented and aggregated Index Terms Big Data Internet of Things Smart Cities KNIME Human Dynamics I I NTRODUCTION Internet of Things IoT 2 is generating prodigious amount of data increasing sophisticated analytic mechanisms and tools that are providing insight that allow us to operate the machines in entirely new ways more effectively and in a collaborative way The power of the data provided by all the resources that are being connected to Internet will bring a new conception of the world where the big data analysis is required to take advantage of its potential for high-level modelling and knowledge engineering The potential of this 003ow of data from physical resources towards the Future Internet facilities is what we want to analyse in this work through Big Data Analytic tools The challenge for Big Data is to understand the interactions between smart objects and humans The origin of the Internet has been a human-human type interactions since the content was de\002ned by humans to be consumed by other humans but with the IoT the content is being de\002ned by objects Therefore the interactions and in\003uence over our lives is an open issue and this needs to be understood how the IoT will play a key role in our Smart Cities and Smart environments In particular this work will analyses these interactions and potential from the perspective of the Human Dynamics  the potential of the Big Data and Smart Cities to increase our quantitative and qualitative understanding regarding the human behaviours Therefore this work will evaluate the potential of the realtime data to build data-driven models and patterns based on human dynamics provide some data-driven models as proofof-concept of the potential of the Big Data Analytic tool for Smart Cities

This work is focused on the SmartSantander testbed which is a port city in the north of Spain which offers 002xed sensors that record temperature traf\002c noise etc The bene\002ts of big data for smart cities include real-time systems monitoring management and optimization Some of the areas where this bene\002ts can be applied include 003ow of traf\002c gas water and electricity monitoring the condition of pipes and bridges planning new public transport routes and grids for utility distribution systems monitoring public health and managing emergency response We analyse the correlation between traf\002c temperature season and working day These inter-relations de\002ne a complex network Complex networks mean that many interacting parts which behave according to simple and individual rules produce a globally coherent behaviour i.e emerging properties and patterns The challenge by what big data is required and all the analysis of these interactions as a network is due that the behaviour at the systems as a whole cannot be predicted from the individual rules only such as stated by Aristotle the whole is greater than the sum of its parts  One of the reasons because the inter-connections/interrelations among different variables in complex networks such as smart cities look random is due to the fact that we are not yet able to understand how all of them are inter-connected Following the last results in network sciences 7 we are aware that not everything is random since everything is connected through networks Therefore we are starting

to disclosure the hidden patterns of the universe and the universality among them 5 These networks are physical social biological cultural and human networks that govern how the different parts of the world operate and how they affect our lives The challenge for the Big Data and IoT is to take bene\002t of this insight to really understand how things are interconnected Then we will be able in a close future not only to understand else able to predict act manage and prevent these situations Thereby evolving from areas partially overlapped such as Big Data IoT Cloud Computing physical devices and humans to a common ecosystem that will be able to act/operate enhance and 002x based on all this emerging knowledge and understanding i.e insight This fusion among areas to build solutions able to solve real problems and act/operate is denominated Cyber Physical Systems II S MART S ANTANDER T ESTBED The port of Santander on the northern coast of Spain is the most data-intensive city in Europe SmartSantander has some 18000 stationary and mobile sensors of various types thought the municipality of around 180000 residents These sensors monitor air pollution noise and other environmental conditions Sensors buried in the pavement detect open parking spaces and relay that information to digital displays mounted at the major intersections to help guide drivers This infrastructure is available for researches at the same time that it is continuously being used by the city services SmartSantander also features a smart phone application denominated PaceOfTheCity  that allows residents to use an augmented-reality solution to interact with over 2600 optical and wireless tags at tourist attractions bus stops shopping centres and other locations throughout the city to readily obtain online information about those places SmartSantander has de\002ned an ecosystem which it is not only a testbed for wireless sensor networks and Future Internet architecture it is also opening new opportunities to be interconnected with Big Data and Cloud Computing to provide intelligence in order to be able to understand the behaviours and even de\002ne actions according to the information captured by the smart objects that are able around the emerging smarter cities In particular SmartSantander EU Project is providing one of the major Smart Cities and IoT testbed in Europe This testbed is providing data from noise traf\002c temperature power consumption parking pots smart labels and other environmental monitoring Figure 1 presents the part of the testbed used for this experimentation composed of 97 temperature sensors and 38 traf\002c sensors The Figure 1 depicts that the areas where the traf\002c and temperature are measured are divergent The same happens with the noise area Consequently it cannot be directly correlated some measure data such as the in\003uence of traf\002c with the noise and the direct in\003uence of the traf\002c density heat radiation from cars with the temperature in that area III K NOWLEDGE DISCOVERY FROM DATA Knowledge discovery from data KDD is composed of multiple stages covering from data analytic to data mining It is the con\003uence of multiple disciplines such as pattern recognition statistics visualization machine learning database technology and other speci\002c disciples depending on the problem such as human dynamics in the scope of this problem The challenges in the knowledge discovery from the data are the management of big and real-time data integration and analytic for urban information in order to build models and patterns about performance infrastructure usage urban information and human dynamics Some examples of these models and patterns are to identify the nature and cause of changes in the different streams in order to predict traf\002c congestions look for patters to explain logical connection of knowledge at various point of time The patterns and behaviour evaluations offers the opportunity to identify the truly interesting patterns representing knowledge based on the interestingness measures from the Smart City Regarding the behaviour such as described by A Barabasi  8 it is v ery focused on b ursts one proof of this is the high number of peaks followed by period of inactivity even during the working hours However it can be modelled with Poisson in order to get a more general estimation Therefore this scenario is probing the A Barabasi conclusions about bursts but at the same time this also shows us that Poisson is a good model for the traf\002c behaviour based on the temperature Similar conclusions about the proper Poissonian explanation of burst behaviours have been also offered for the Barabasi models in In order to see this correlation in more details the knowledge presentation is presented through the visualization in the Figures 2 of the traf\002c aggregated by temperature bins Thereby this aggregation by temperature bins offer the opportunity to see clearly what is the direct in\003uence of traf\002c with respect to traf\002c density The correlation and aggregation of the data between the temperature and the traf\002c presents as several of the human behaviours a Poisson distribution model The Poisson distribution model allows us to determinate the quantity of traf\002c through the interpolation of the 025 value For example for this speci\002c case in August 2013 we have that 025  22  i.e the maximum traf\002c happens between at 22 degrees Knowing that the distribution is Poisson and 025  22 for August Then the level of traf\002c for the rest of temperatures can be interpolated for that period of time At the same way it can be also seen that in December is the maximum traf\002c happens between at 025  10  5 degrees And we can see as in April the traf\002c is much more distributed in a major range between 7 and 12 degrees since this season spring presents a warmer weather and not so characterized by cold or hot as winter and summer respectively Thereby even when we have seen in the Figures 2a and 2b that the behaviour was based on bursts i.e when we analyze

Fig 1 SmartSantander TestBed Traf\002c and Temperature Deployment the behaviour in detail when we try to build a more general model then we discover that such as de\002ned historically the Poisson is a good model to simplify and evaluate these variables Finally the traf\002c density distribution have been also evaluated where we can see in the plots from the Figure 3 that the majority of the time the traf\002c density is low for that reason 002rst column is always the higher and that after that the most common range of traf\002c is among 8 and 10 which means a very 003uid traf\002c Finally heavy tails are presented for high densities This contrast among a long time of low activity and heavy tails for high traf\002c density is what present a bursts behaviour such as described by A Barabasi in It is usual that these environments where the time without activities and with social in\003uences such as time for lunch and time to go to work de\002ne the bursts that are followed by long inactivities such as nights and mid-term of\002ce hours IV D ISCUSSION The human dynamics and clear correlation among nature and our behaviours Demonstrate that the nature is not a result of the chaos and does not exist the lawlessness in the universe If we see chaos or lawlessness it is due to the lack of knowledge The lack of knowledge has been historically the main reason to does not understand the patterns laws and complex networks inside of what we are just able to interpret as random The insight of the world will be one of the major success during the coming years as a consequence of the new senses to see the world provided by the Internet of Things the Big Data tools to extract knowledge from the data and the advances in modelling and formalizing network sciences Parts of these synchronism between traf\002c and temperature are biologically de\002ned by the circadian rhythms At the same time it is clear that not only the temperature is an in\003uence else it is a complex network where all the people is in\003uenced among them Another nature proofs of this are the 002re\003ies that light up at the same time ants colonies neurons or g anizations the evolution of species are proofs of the existence of a universal connection and collective intelligence Such as mentioned by Aristotle in the 4th century BCE the whole is greater than the sum of its parts  This work has presented the analysis of the traf\002c and temperature correlations where has been seen a Poisson distribution even when the nature of the data has bursts behaviours such as described in the Human Dynamics In order to present the bursts behaviour it has also modelled the traf\002c density distribution where it is evaluated that the

majority of the time is presenting a low activity due to the social cycles Consequently contrasting with the high activity periods burst periods such as early morning to move from home to the of\002ce or lunch time Therefore even when bursts behaviours are present when it is analysed taking into account some of the in\003uences in the complex network such as the temperature a Poisson distribution is presented offering therefore a modelling and simpli\002cation of the problem In de\002nitive it cannot be determinate that Poisson is not longer a valid model since it is clearly modelling the correlation between temperature and traf\002c but at the same time we need to take into account the human dynamics and burst nature of the data V C ONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS The entities in the world are not just able to act else they are also able to sense Smart cities via IoT devices are also being able to sense in addition to act Therefore it is expected that at the same way that the rest of the nature we can learn and synchronize in order to optimize our energy time and life quality The recent changes in the world such as the lower cost for sensors more capacity or data analysis all the devices machines and appliances communicating seamlessly with each other and with us are allowing to build a world where information itself becomes intelligent and comes to us automatically when we need it without having to look for it All this is impacting since it is allowing us to shift to preventive condition-based maintenance which means 002xing machines just before they break without wasting time i.e serving them on a 002xed and planned schedule Zero unplanned downtime which means will not more power outages no more 003ight delays no more traf\002c congestion We are starting the new age of the human dynamics insight and smart cities as SmartSantander are establishing the reference of infrastructure of what will be a mandatory need in a very close future This has been just an initial analysis of our experiences with Big Data and Smart Cities over European testbeds in IoT Regarding the SmartSantander testbed we have found the inconvenient of the lack of geo-correlations among the different sensors which is limiting the direct correlation of noise temperature number of parking pots with traf\002c etc For that reason in addition to the SmartSantander testbed the coming works are also promoting to gather more contextualized data through the crowdsensing of the temperature and individual tracking informations from personal platforms such as smart phone Thereby it could be extrapolated to traf\002c forecast The ongoing work is focused on the data characterization i.e produce a description summarizing the characteristics of the human dynamic by traf\002c density and other factors in order to offer classes such as 003uid and heavy traf\002c which can be extrapolated from the difference between working day/weekend temperature season and hour of the day This data characterization will allow to carry out data discrimination among classes in order to offer a comparison of the general features of targeting classes of traf\002c and behaviours with the general features of other cities which could act as contrasting classes Finally it could offer the opportunity to develop new applications and solutions to offer prediction of the traf\002c and consequently prevention actions such as suggest usage of public transport or recommend a time to depart in order to arrive on time to the of\002ce or for a meeting VI A CKNOWLEDGEMENT The authors would like to

the size of the data cube and does not change as the number of updates increases We also evaluate the scalability of R-Store In this experiment the number of nodes and the data size increase with the same ratio The percentage of updates is set to 1 for different scalability settings As can be seen in Figure 6 the running time of both re-computation the brown line and incremental update blue line do not change much as the number of nodes increase which demonstrates the scalability of R-Store 1 algorithm which optimizes the real-time query using the data cube with the algorithm implemented with

shuf\224es fewer data to MapReduce 2 its MapReduce job processes fewer data than that of re-computation However as the percentage of updated keys increases more data are shuf\224ed from HBaseR to MapReduce Thus both the scan time and the execution time increase In contrast for  since the always shuf\224es one version for each key to MapReduce the amount of data shuf\224ed from HBase-R is constant As a result the running time of is almost constant Due to the existence of the 223ltering condition on attribute  most tuples of the table are 223ltered and fewer data are sorted and

involve multiple tables which will not be able to illustrate as clearly the effectiveness of the basic operators supported in R-Store The parameter of TPC-H Q1 is set to 215365\216 days and only about

method increases slightly which is due to two reasons 1 the data before In this experiment we investigate the performance of OLTP queries when OLAP queries are running The workload is update-only and the keys being updated are uniformly distributed We launch ten clients to concurrently submit the updates when the system is deployed on 100 nodes Each client starts ten threads each of which submits one million updates 100 updates in batch Another client is launched to submit the data cube slice query That is one OLAP query and approximately 50,000 updates are concurrently processed in R-Store The system reaches its maximum usage in this setting based on our observation When the system is deployed on other number of nodes the number of clients submitting updates is adjusted accordingly Figure 11\(a shows the throughput of the system The throughput increases as the number of nodes increases which demonstrates the scalability of the system However when OLAP queries are running the update performance is lower than running only OLTP queries This result is expected because the OLAP queries compete for resources with the OLTP queries We also evaluate the latency of updates when the system is approximately fully used As shown in Figure 11\(b the aggregated response time for 1000 updates are similar with respect to varying scales VII C ONCLUSION MapReduce is a parallel execution

MapReduce HBase-R has to scan all the of the table Since the is materialized to HDFS when it is full these 223les are sorted by time Thus instead of scanning all the and between  only the between   are scanned The value of decides the freshness of the result There is a trade-off between the performance of the query and the freshness of the result the smaller is the fewer real-time data are scanned Figure 9 shows the query processing time with different freshness ratios which is de\223ned as the percentage of the real-time data we have to scan for the query In this experiment  1600 million and 800 million updates on 1 distinct keys are submitted to HBase-R When the freshness ratio is 0 the input of the query is only the data cube Thus the cost of scanning the real-time data is 0 When the freshness ratio increases to 10 the cost of scanning the real-time data is around 1500 seconds because the cost of scanning the real-time table dominates the OLAP query As the freshness ratio increases the running time of and  and when it is not  and  We submit 800 million updates to the server each day and the percentage of keys updated is 223xed to 1 The data cube is refreshed at the beginning of each day and the OLAP query is submitted to the server at the end of the day Since the data are compacted after the data cube refresh the amount of data stored in the real-time table are almost the same at the same time of each day The processing time of and are thus almost constant In contrast when the compaction scheme is turned off HBase-R stores much more data and the cost of locally scanning these data becomes larger than the cost of shuf\224ing the data to MapReduce As a result the processing time of and increases over time and and a user speci\223ed timestamp still need to be scanned and 2 the amount of data shuf\224ed to mappers are roughly the same with different ratios Figure 10 depicts the effectiveness of our compaction scheme In this experiment we measure the

Compaction    a Throughput    b Latency Fig 11 Performance of OLTP Queries a large scale distributed environment However most existing works only focus on optimizing the OLAP queries and assume that the data scanned by MapReduce are unchanged during the execution of a MapReduce job In reality the real-time results from the most recently updated data are more meaningful for decision making In this paper we propose R-Store for supporting real-time OLAP on MapReduce R-Store leverages stable technology HBase and HStreaming and extends them to achieve high performance and scalability The storage system of R-Store adopts multi-version concurrency control to support real-time OLAP To reduce the storage requirement it periodically materializes the real-time data into a data cube and compacts the historical versions into one version During query processing the proposed adaptive incremental scan operation shuf\224es the real-time data to MapReduce ef\223ciently The data cube and the newly updated data are combined in MapReduce to return the real-time results In addition based on our proposed cost model the more ef\223cient query processing method is selected To evaluate the performance of R-Store we have conducted extensive experimental study using the TPCH data The experimental results show that our system can support real-time OLAP queries much more ef\223ciently than the baseline methods Though the performance of OLTP degrades slightly due to the competition for resources with OLAP the response time and throughput remain good and acceptable A CKNOWLEDGMENT The work described
