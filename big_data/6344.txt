en-US Miniaturized Claw-Pole Generators and Motors with High Power Density en-US  O. M\366nnich 1 R. Dreyer genannt Daweke 1 H. Lehr 1  en-US 1 Technische Universit\344t Berlin, Department of Electromechanical and Optical Systems, Germany en-US moennich@fmt.tu-berlin.de en-US  en-US  en-US Abstract Energ y harvesting systems converting kinetic energy to drive an electromagnetic ge ne ra tor either to power an electronic device directly or to charge a secondary battery may be used to substitute big size and heavy weight batteries of autonomous sy st ems.  The output voltage and current of the generator is mostly transient and discontinuous in nature and must be converted to a DC signal  This requires energy converters with small vo lume and low weight.  We therefore present a novel topo logy for a claw-pole generator which features an extremely compact design and high conversion efficiency.  The de sign can be further miniaturized still using conventional processes and technologies for manufacturing  In the development process a na lytical calculations applying re luctance network techniques were first carried out in order to determine the basic geo me try of the magnetic circuit.  A 3D-FE model was created to perform field calculations in order to  op timize the alternator's out pu t power.  These investigations also allowed a substantial re du ction of  the cogging torque which is typical for claw-pole machines  The 3DFE model cal cu lations are in good agreement with ex pe rimental results.  However, it turned out that there is a high sensi tivity of the cogging torque to geometrical variations of the claws.  When extending the system to two electrical phases, the generator principle was applied to build a motor with a high torque density.  In a comparison with the data of commercially available motors of similar size it turned out that this new machine is more than a match to them en-US I  I NTRODUCTION  en-US Kinetic energy is one of the most readily available energy sour ces  for energy harvesting devices  Typical applications in clude the displacement or vibration of a proof mass in magnetic induction transducers or inertial converters based on piezoelectricity  However rotating machines are rather seldom applied up to now, although there are a number of small mo tors on the m ar ket  One reason may be  that they have a fixed shape, which is rather often not adapted to existing as semblies.  Clearly, they are not optimized to be used as genera tors.  They usually contain permanent magnets, which provide high power density without energy consumption and coreless coils which are fabricated using specific manufacturing methods \(Faulhaber, Maxon en-US On the other hand, there are only few miniaturized gene ra tors available.  Relatively small claw-pole synchronous generators are now widely used as alternators in automobiles [1    The main drawback of usual claw-pole alternators is their complex geometry often resulting in structures which are complicated to manufacture Due to small air gaps they nevertheless offer the opportunity to fully utilize the high flux density from nowadays rare earth magnets en-US There is a growing demand for small generator systems with high efficiency for energy harvesting purposes.  Typical applications are miniaturized energy sour ces with a huge lifetime for autonomous electronic devices such as portable energy sources for emergency systems wireless electronic door locks or portable medical devices en-US In order to miniaturize the size of a claw-pole ge ne rator and to ease its construction different geometrical modifications have been applied.  In a first step, the ring magnet was substituted by smaller separated ma gnets, leading to a reduction in diameter.  The to po logy of the soft-magnetic rotor was also changed.  The new shape leaves more space for the coil simplifies the ma nu fac tu ring of the rotor considerably and enables further mi ni atu ri zation of the system  In Fig 1 the consecutive steps of design optimization are depicted  As a re sult the new structure provides for an easy fabrication of both the soft magnetic parts and the ring coil.  The cylindrical coil is  simple to manufacture and thus well-suited for mass production.  It allows a high package density of wire, which en-US en-US  en-US  en-US Fig. 1  Different topologies of the claw pole alternator with 6 pole pairs Subfigures \(a\ to \(d\ indicate how the miniaturized system \(d wa s developed from the known form  in \(a 2   en-US  445 978-1-4799-5183-3/14/$31.00 \251  2014 IEEE

L eft: maximum flux through the coil middle no flux through the coil  right maximum flux through the coil with opposite flux  direction 2  en-US re duces Ohmic losses  Moreover the flat shape of the coil provides a relatively large surface for heat transfer to the housing en-US The soft-magnetic parts, the claw disk shaped rotor and the yoke of the proposed design feature very simple geometries and are easy and cheap to manufacture, applying typical mass fabrication technologies like e. g. stamping or injection molding of polymer bonded magnets en-US By use of a specific mounting jig the small permanent NdFeB magnet chips, which are available on the market, are in one assembly step glued to the return yoke with alternating po larity en-US However  due to the transverse-flux-machine topology, the magnetic field in the air gap distributes in a complicated way in three dimensions This results in an elaborate calculation and design process en-US The principle of operation is shown in Fig. 2 Depending on the rotor rotation angle, the magnetic flux generated by the permanent ma gnets changes its direction when passing through the core  In a position where the rotor claws are aligned with the permanent magnet poles the magnetic flux through the core and the coil reaches a maximum.  As the ro tor angle increases, the flux generated by two adjacent magnets closes across the claw, leading to zero magnetic field in the core  Further rotation results in a change of field direction du e to the opposite pole direction of the following permanent magnets  At constant rotation al  speed the flux change features an a pp ro xi mately sinusoidal function, which leads to an in duced voltage in the coil en-US  en-US  u i  t  1 en-US  en-US where N is the number of coil turns.  With a sinusoidal flux change, the induced voltage will also be sinusoidal.  In order to attain a generator voltage at low rotational speed, suited for specific applications the amplitude of the magnetic flux  through the coil has to be maximized since the number of windings cannot be chosen freely for a miniaturized system without considerable increase of Ohmic losses en-US Due to periodic changes in reluctance with increasing rotor angle, the amount of energy which is stored in the magnetic field varies   en-US The result is a periodic cogging torque, which is given by en-US  en-US  T cogg  m  2 en-US  en-US Therefore one main development goal is  to minimize the cogging torque as it hinders smooth rotation and creates additional loads for the bearings  This means that the machine has to be designed such  that magnetic energy varies as less as possible during rotation en-US II  A NALYTICAL AND NUMERICAL G ENERATOR M ODELS  en-US During the early stage of development the generator was modeled with a reluctance network in order to develop its basic geometry  The network is shown in Fig  3 en-US Taking approximate material properties of the permanentmagnet, geometrical parameters like pole and yoke thickness as well as air gap size were obtained.  But there is no doubt that analytical calculation can only give approximate results  Hence in a second step t he se  parameters were optimized using the finite element method \(FEM\.  A 3D model of the ge nerator was created and computed in order to obtain mor e accurate results for the relevant properties of the system, such as magnetic flux trough the coil and the resulting cogging torque en-US With the basic geometry, a 3DFE model was created using ANSYS Maxwell \256 [3    I n  o r d er  to  o p tim ize th e a l ter n ato r  power output and to reduce the cogging torque geometry parameters such as claw width and thickness the size of the permanent magnets and coil dimensions were varied en-US Fig. 4 shows the magnetic field distributions in the alter na tor at different rotor angles, where the magnetic flux changes its direction th rough the system en-US The cogging torque was found to depend on the width of the rotor claws.  This is illustrated in Fig. 5, which depicts the cogging torque as function of the rotation angle for different claw-pole widths  The mi ni mum cogging torque arises at a en-US en-US  en-US  en-US Fig. 3  Reluctance network representing the ma gnetic circuit  en-US of the generator   2   446

If a certain loss of magnetic flux is accep ted the  cogging torque can be reduced considerably [2   en-US claw width of 1.8 mm However, the magnetic flux through the coil is also influenced by the claw width   en-US This is shown in Fig 6  where both the amplitude of the calcu lated and measured cogging torque as well as the ma gnetic flux are plotted as function of the claw width  The magnetic flux decreases with increasing claw width, since broad claws facilitate the flux leakage between adjacent magnets  M in imal cogging torque values are ex perimentally ob tained at a claw-width of 1.9 mm at only one percent loss of calculated flux amplitude en-US III  P ROTOTYPE MANUFACTURING  en-US Due to its high saturation polarization of about 2.35 T Vacoflux 50 \(cobalt-iron  is chosen for all soft-magnetic parts of the generator [4    T h e co il  h as 500 turns and consists of a selfbon ding copper wire with a diameter of 80 \265m.  As energy density is vital for miniaturized systems, NdFeB is chosen as permanent magnet material  The bearing consists of bronze sinter material en-US Only conventional manufacturing methods such as milling and lathing were applied, whereas for mass production, other techniques are more suitable en-US Fig 7 presents a picture of the first generator prototype with 6 pole pairs, whereby the rotor is removed.  The gene ra tor has a diameter of 12 mm and an axial length of 3 mm  en-US IV  EXPERIMENTS  en-US Data from different generator prototypes were taken on a test bench  The generators were identically constructed except for the rotor, where different claw widths were applied according to the FEM calculations.  The test bench allows the determination of the rotational speed, the applied torque, the terminal voltage and the current.  The generators were driven by a motor at various rotational speeds, with different load resistances applied.  Due to that, input and output power could be computed en-US V  RESULTS  en-US The graph in Fig. 6 shows a good agreement of the calculated and measured cogging torques.  The minimum cogging torque of 0.2 mNm is achieved with a claw width of 1.9 mm  However, the cogging torque turns out to be very sensitive to changes in the claw width  T he  variation of the claw width with 0.2 mm leads to a doubling of the cogging torque for example   en-US The terminal voltage as a function of rotational speed is shown in Fig. 8  It increases monotonically with increasing ro tation speed.  The open circuit voltage reaches about 5 V at 4 000 rpm  The output power amounts to 400 mW at 20.000 rpm  The maximum efficiency is 49 en-US VI  A PPLICATION OF THE G ENERATOR  en-US The claw-pole generator described above was developed to fit exactly into a new autonomous door lock system  Operating the door handle manually see Fig 10  the resulting torque rotates a transmission train which actuates the geneen-US en-US  en-US  en-US Fig. 4  Magnetic induction in a gene rator at three different angles of ro ta tion  0\260, 7.5\260 and 15\260, respectively [2  en-US en-US  en-US  en-US Fig. 5  Calculated static torque for different widths of the rotor claws from 1 5  mm  to 2.0 mm [2  en-US  en-US en-US  en-US  en-US Fig. 7  Claw pole generator with rotor removed [2  447

Fast pressing of the door handle produces enough energy for unlocking  In case of slower movements a repeated motion was necessary  The dimensions of the gene ra tor are: diameter 12 mm, height 3 mm  Re quirements for the electrical data: 5 V at a power ra ting of 200 mW en-US VII  C LAW POLE MOTOR  en-US Based on the generator design in Figs. 1 and 2, a claw-pole motor was developed  It exhibits a very simple design and offers a high torque density, which is about 23 times bigger than those of other motors on the market  which are comparable in size [2  5  6    T h e  tw o  p h ase m ac h i n e is  co m p o s ed  o f  two identical setups  E ach  setup consists of a pot-shaped yoke a cy lindrical coil a claw disk and concentrically arranged magnets with alternating radial polarization  The claw disks are fixed on the shaft with an electrical offse t of ninety degrees to each other.  The construction of the claw-pole motor is shown in Fig. 9 en-US The motor can be operated by sinusoidal voltages with a phase difference of 90\260 or by block commutation.  The phase difference between the two coil voltages is used to control the di rection of the rotation  In order to simplify the electrical circuit, the motor is excited using block commutation during the experiments en-US A first prototype of the claw-pole motor is shown in Fig. 11 en-US Experiments were carried out with three different sized claw-pole motor prototypes  two with a diameter of 6 mm and with different numbers of coils turns and one with a diameter of 14  mm   en-US In order to find the rated current thermal investigations were carried out which included the application of different currents and the measurement of the stationary temperature using a thermal sensor en-US The critical component of the motor is the insulation layer of the copper wire for the coils, with a maximum temperature of 140 260C  The maximum operation temperature of the perma nent magnets is 150 260C Fig. 12 shows the stationary motor temperature as a function of motor current  It  de pends largely on the heat transfer to the environment.  The tempe ra ture is considerably lower in case the motor is embedded in the clamping of the test bench.  The stationary temperature is much higher for an operation in an air environment.  The air en vironment was assumed to re present the worst case and thus gives the rated current en-US At rated current, the motor with 6 mm diameter has an output power of 250 mW at 15.000 rpm  Maximum efficiency of the motor is 21 %, where as the prototype with a diameter of 14 mm reaches 49 % efficiency en-US Fig 13 shows that the developed motors are superior to other motors on the market when we compare the torques as function of the motor volumes.

en-US torque density is the high functional integration of the system s components  For example the soft magnetic yoke s serve as coil cores bearings and housing as well  The high torque opens a wide area of applications to the proposed motor type  Ho wever, the remaining cogging torque may rule out its application in cases where smooth running is mandatory en-US VI  APPLICATION OF THE MOTOR  en-US Due to the high energy density and its robust design, there were interests to combine the motor with a gear and to apply this system as window opener in a car left side Fig 14 The assembly of the prototype claw-pole motor with the gear unit right side Fig 14 fabricated by injection molding transmission ratio 20:1 lead to a driving unit with 13 5 mm diameter and a length of 15 mm, which produces a torque of 0.1 Nm en-US VIII  C ONCLUSION  en-US In this paper a miniaturized claw-pole ge nerator is  proposed to be applied in energy harvesting systems It offers a high power density a simpl e construction and is cheap to  ma nu facture  The claw geometry was op ti mized using 3D FE  cal culations in order to reduce the cogging torque while at the same time the magnetic flux was kept as high as possible  Experimental results confirm the generator data obtained by use of field calculations.  The applications of the generator in an auto no mous door lock system to generate electrical energy by pressing the door handle turned out to be rather successful However further development work will be done to reduce the cogging torque even more en-US From the basic generator design, a two phase synchronous reluctance motor was derived which proved to have higher torque density than other motors on the market comparable in size.  The combination of the claw-pole motor into a gear box resulted in a compact geared motor with high tor que  First tests revealed that this unit may well be used as a window opener in cars en-US R EFERENCES  en-US 1  H a i j u n  B a i   F e n g g e  Z h a n g   G r u e n b e r g e r   H  P    N o l l e   E   Study on Novel Claw Pole Automobile Generator with Outer PM Rotor  Industrial Electronics and Applications, 2007 ICIEA 2007. 2nd IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications pp 632 635 May 23  25 2007  doi: 10.1109/ICIEA.2007.4318484 2  W a l t e r   S    Entwicklung miniaturisierter elektrodynamischer Energiewandler mit Reluktanzl\344ufer PhD thesis at the Technische Universit\344t Berlin  2004 en-US 3  M A X W E L L 256 3 D v 1 6  A n sy s I n c   en-US 4  Va kuumschmelze GmbH  Co KG 2014 January 10 Weich ma gne tische Kobalt Eisen Legierungen  online product broschure     http://www.vacuumschmelze.de/fileadmin/documents/broschueren/htbr osch/Pht-004_d.pdf en-GB 5   L e h r   H    E h r f e l d   W    H a g e man n   B    K 344 mp e r   K  P    M i c h e l   F    Schulz, Ch.; Th\374rigen, Ch Development of micro- and millimotors  Minimally Invasive Therapy and Allied Technologies Blackwell Science Ltd., Volume 6, page 191 194 June 1997 en-GB 6   Ju f e r   M    P 351 c l a t   C    B i r k i c h t   A    Electromagnetic High Speed Micromotor Proc 26 th ann.

PRELIMINARY EMPIRICAL RESULTS This section reports an empirical study we performed with the aim of getting preliminary insights about the proposed change impact analysis approach. The goal of this study is to analyze to what extent Granger causality can be used as a complement to association rules to predict source code ?les change impact by using data from versioning systems. The quality focus is the increase of precision / recall in predicting change impacts, as well as the capability of di?erent techniques to detect complementary change impact sets. The perspective is of a maintainer interested to understand what 


les could be potentially a?ected by changes occurring in a given ?le. The context consists of change sets extracted from the versioning history of Samba1a well-known ?le and print service developed to ensure interoperability between Microsoft Windows and Unixes. Speci?cally, we analyzed 10531 snapshots, from release 1.9.16 to release 3.0.0 and restricted our analysis to ?les belonging to the Samba daemon \(i.e., smbd only 5265 dict change impacts, using the actual changes occurring in these snapshots as an oracle for evaluating the performances of our prediction Figure 1 shows, for di?erent values of top-n \(i.e., links with highest strength, increasing from the left to the right for di?erent techniques \(association rules, Granger causality, and the combination of both recall obtained when identifying the change impact of a class. Precision is de?ned as the ratio between the number predicted true changes and the total number of predicted changes, while recall is de?ned as the ratio between the number of predicted true changes and the total number of true changes As it can be seen, for lower values of n Granger starts with a high precision \(90 increasing top-n to about 70%, without positively increasing the recall. The precision for association rules starts lower 1http://www.samba.org       1  2 3 4 5 3 6 7 8

Finally, the precision for the combination of the two techniques starts very high 100%, with, however, few links retrieved to ? 75%, and ?nally rises again to ? 82%. Overall, the combination of both techniques seems to exhibit the best precision/recall compromise, i.e., to start with a very high precision, but then to keep it as high as association rules The complementarity of the two techniques is even more evident when looking at Figure 2, which shows, for di?erent values of top-n, the number of true impacts found by Granger causality \(and not found by association rules association rules \(and not by Granger causality found by both techniques at the same time. This ?gure shows that the intersection between the two techniques is always lower \(from 7 vs 37 and 31 for top-100, up to 25 vs 50 and 56 for top-200 one technique only Finally, Figure 3 shows an excerpt of an impact graph highlighting impact relations identi?ed by association rules plain lines dotted lines bold lines related to Samba authentication \(auth_*.c responsible of handling errors providing requests

Changes performed to auth_* ?les immediately impact on reply.c and on uid.c, as shown by relations identi?ed by association rules. Instead, the graph shows that changes are propagated only after a while to error.c: in fact the change impact relation is identi?ed by Granger causality only. For instance, on Aug 8, 2001 both auth_* ?les and reply.c \(revision 1.316 note \(smbd/auth server: Doco we want to use cli nt error here soon smbd/password.c management needs to be updated soon. This happened on Aug 27, 2001 \(commit note: . . . added automatic mapping between dos and nt error codes went a change \(to revision 1.6 The performed study su?ers of some threats to validity In particular, threats to internal validity, as this kind of impact analysis \(Granger test and its combination with as165 Figure 3: Excerpt of impact graph sociation rules signi?cant correlation between a change occurring to a ?le and future changes occurring to other ?les. Our approach is purely statistical, hence there is no guarantee to ensure source code change causality. Also, the study can su?er of threats to external validity, as this is only one, small preliminary study. Further, larger studies are desirable to better assess the performances and the scalability of the proposed approach 4. EMERGING RESEARCH DIRECTIONS Driven by bioinformatics, where the Granger causality test is largely used to derive causal relationships among different elements, such as genes and proteins, we have developed a novel change impact analysis method that uses the Granger causality test to learn impact relationships among software artifacts. The main idea of the method is to infer the mutual dependencies between software artifacts by measuring the statistical con?dence that the time series representing the history of changes of a software artifact can be used to predict the changes of another artifact. The problem is therefore posed as a statistical test, evaluating the quality 


of forecasting of a variable given another one In this paper the method has been compared with the application of association rules [9, 10], and the preliminary results suggest that the Granger causality test can be a viable approach to change impact analysis, as it complements existing approaches. As a matter of fact, while association rules capture co-changes, Granger causality helps learning consequent changes. While not shown in this paper for the sake of space, we have compared the results of the proposed impact analysis method against traditional methods based on static analysis, and also in this case we found that they are able to highlight complementary, yet useful, impact relationships. This opens the way towards an eclectic impact analysis approach that combines existing methods, to overcome the limitation of the individual methods, and provides software engineers with a richer set of information useful to assess the impact of a change There are several directions in which the work presented here can be expanded. Of course, a ?rst direction is the development of further empirical studies to fully understand advantages and limitation of the proposed method, to compare it with other \(traditional and to develop heuristics for improvement The application of Granger causality depends entirely on the appropriate selection of variables. In this paper we have used an impulsive \(0,1 in a snapshot. However, other variables should be explored for example the variation of some metric values. Furthermore, the method could be applied for object-oriented system, considering classes and methods instead of functions We are interested to compare the Granger causality approach against the dynamic Bayesian network inference, which is a well-known approach used to derive causal relationships. Finally, we are investigating the use of information theoretic approaches based on mutual information 5. REFERENCES 1] R. Agrawal, T. Imielinski, and A. N. Swami.

Pruning experiences at support 0.25  V. DISCUSSION AND CHALLENGES It is important to discuss the technique presented here with focus on the purpose the technique pursues:  to produce semantic recommendation The reader should have noticed that the algorithm presented 


relies strongly on "choice". For instance, the algorithm chooses ears in the graph to form an order for elimination, and the choice is arbitrary. This strategy is essential to maintain low complexity \(polynomial practical. Nevertheless, a warned reader may conclude that this arbitrary choice implies that there are many compactions to produce and therefore the approach as a whole does not show to produce an optimal solution. And the reader is right in this conclusion. Since the goal is compaction, the search for an optimal solution can be bypassed provided a substantial level of pruning is achieved To complete the whole view, we describe how web service descriptions are complemented with the association rules as recommendations. In effect, under our scheme, the document describing the web service is augmented with a set of OWL/RDF/S triples that only incorporate the non-pruned rules with the format of Example 1, that is, the set ARmin of the compaction program obtained by our algorithm, together with the thresholds applied to the mining process and a registered URI of a registered description service. The assumptions and defeaters are not added to the web service description. If the associations encoded in the triples are not sufficient for the client \(a search engine, for instance widening of the response to the description service identified by the given URI, and then the assumptions and defeaters are produced. The reasoning task required for deriving all the implicitly published rules is client responsibility Notice that, under this scheme, the actual rules that appear as members of the set initial ARmin set are irrelevant; the only important issue is the size of the set The developed scheme also supports an extension of the algorithm that admits the assignment of priorities to rules and to itemsets, in order to allow the user to produce a more controlled program as output. Nonetheless, the importance of the extension has not been already tested, and therefore it is beyond the subject of the present paper It would be also interesting to design a scheme that supports queries where the client provides an itemset class and values for support and confidence and the engine produces a maximal class of inferred associated itemsets as a response. This scheme is also under development, so we have not discussed this aspect here 


VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have presented a defeasible logic framework for managing associations that helps in reducing the number of rules found in a set of discovered associations. We have presented an induction algorithm for inducing programs in our logic, made of assumption schemas, a reduced set of association rules and a set of counter-arguments to conclusions called defeaters, guaranteeing that every pruned rule can be effectively inferred from the output. Our approach outperform those of [17], because all reduction compactions presented there can be expressed and induced in our framework, and several other patterns, particular to the given datasets, can also be found. In addition, since a set of definite clauses can be obtained from the induced programs, the knowledge obtained can be modularly inserted in a richer inference engine Abduction can be also attempted, asking for justifications that explain the presence of certain association in the dataset The framework presented can be extended in several ways Admitting defeaters to appear in the head of assumption, to define user interest Admitting arithmetic expressions within assumptions for adjustment in pruning Admitting set formation patterns as itemset constants Extending the scope, to cover temporal association rules REFERENCES 1]  R.
