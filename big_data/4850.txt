A Recommendation Model for Personalized Book Lists Suthathip Maneewongvatana  and Songrit Maneewongvatana   Department of Computer Engineering King Mongkutês University of Technology Thonbu ri, Thailand  E-mail: fay@cpe.kmutt.ac.th  E-mail: songrit@cpe.kmutt.ac.th    Abstract In this study, we present a novel approach to recommend the personalized book lists for the university members. Our approach co nsists of clustering the university 
members into different clu sters based on th eir recent circulation activities and discovering the interes t patterns of members in the cluster. In the first step, we clustered memb ers sharing the common interests to the same cluster by using K-means algorithm, after that we explored the possible interest patterns performed by members in each cluster by association rules Finally, we provided the recommended booklists that satisfy their individual needs and in terest patterns. A questionnaire survey was performed to evalua te the accuracy satisfaction of predicting the satisfy booklist to an individual. The evaluation results reveal the possibility of using circulation activity history 
to predict the current interest of an individual member and construct the personalized book lists that satisfy their interests  I  I NTRODUCTION  Many online businesses are trying to improve their marketing approach by discovering the customer interest and delivering the personalized recommendation list of the products that satisfy the customer needs. The personalized recommendation lists capitalize in motivating the new customers and retaining th e existing customers Similarly, to improve the personal efficiency in the academic organizer consisting of members with variety in interests, the organizer should provide 
the information satisfying their interests.  This work applies the personalized recommendation system to th e libraryês circulation activities for generating the personal book list for its members. The problem of personalized book recommendation system is the enormous number of members and books. Under this circumstance, we cannot create the specific booklist for an individual member. To solve this problem, we categorized the members into clusters based on the similarity of their interests and assigned the su itable book categories to the members within the cluster. A book categorization system that is widely used in libraries is the LC call number. This system classifies the books into different subject areas. For member clustering 
we adopt the concept of data mining techniques such as Kmeans clustering algorithm to cluster the members based on their transaction history. This tec hnique is similar to the news feed service of Carvalho et al [2  which used an internet access log file to cluster the users with similar behavior and deliver the suitable news to the cluster members We also extended the book recommendation system by studying the interest patterns of members in different clusters The interest patterns are discovered by analyzing the patterns of circulation activities performed by the members through the association rules. To approach the current interest of an 
individual, we considered both explicit and implicit patterns by using Apriori and Tertius asso ciation algorithm to analyze the circulation data In order to generate the recommendation list for the members, we adopt the conc ept of collaboration by aggregating the favorite from all members similar to the work of Rome us ed the web usa ge pattern of one group of student to construct the web travelling recommendation system for othe r students in the self learning environment In the end of our study, we evaluate the user satisfaction to their personal book recomme ndation list. The evaluation results reveal the possib 
ility of using circulation activity history to predict the current in terest of an individual member and construct the personalized book recommendation lists II  P ROPOSED B OOK R ECOMMENDATION SYSTEM  The processes of our proposed book recommendation system can be divided into 2 ma in stepspatron clustering and interest pattern discovery. In the first step, the library circulation history data is preprocessed to eliminate noise After that the cleansed data is passed through the patron clustering process. In this state, we clustered patrons with 
similar interest into the same clu ster and differentiates patrons with unrelated interest into other clusters. In the second step the possible interest patterns pe rformed by patrons in each cluster were discovered. We can generate the cluster preference lists and discover the cluster interest patterns via the association rules. Finally the personalized book recommendation list was generated for an individual member of the cluster. The diagram representing the process of our proposed system is shown in Fig. 1. The detail of our proposed system is explained below  389 978-1-4244-7010-5/10/$26.00 c2010 IEEE ISCIT 2010

The total number of subclasses is 219 subclasses There are other types of proprietary systems of library classification such as Dewey Decimal Classification \(DDC that can be used to categorize the book in the library. Our concept can be applied to any of those which hierarchically divide subjects into classes and subclasses B  Data Collection The data of circulation acti vities are collected from the circulation history database of the Library Management \(LM system of King Mongkutês University of Technology Thonburi. Circulation activities cons ist of check in, check out reservation, renew, fine relat ed activities, etc. However, we used only check out, reservation, and renew transactions since other activities do not represent the member interest on particular subject. The transactions were collected during 20/12/2008-12/10/2009. There are 70,720 transactions performed by 4,421 patrons. The information for each transaction consists of patron ID, and the LC call number of item  After collecting the history of circulation activities, we constructed the feature vector of circulation activ ities for an individual member by counting the numbers of transactions related to both patron ID and LC call subclass \(see Table III For example, a member with patron ID 100001 has 5 circulation activities on books of subclass QA. Initially, the 390 


feature vector has 219 elements corresponding to LC subclasses T ABLE III A N EXAMPLE OF FEATURE VECTORS REPRESENTING THE NUMBERS OF TRANSACTIONS FOR DIFFERENT LC  CALL SUBCLASSES OF AN INDIVIDUAL PATRON  ptnID  AC  AE  AG    QA    TP    ZA  1000000  0  0  0    0    4    0  1000001  0  0  0    5    0    0  1000003  0  0  0    2    0    0  1000006  0  0  0    1    0    0  1000019  0  0  0    0    0    0                      1040433  0  0  0    0    0    0  C  Data Preprocess The feature vectors of circulation activity give the information of the number of transactions that an individual member employed the items in each subclass. We filtered the trivial data by removing the feature vector of members that have the total number of transactions less than 5. Moreover we also removed the subclasses that have the total number of transaction less than 5. Finally, we have the number of members and LC call subclass equal to 2031 members and 90 subclasses, respectively  After filter the insignificant data, the next step is data normalization. We normalized the number of transactions that an individual member performed in each subclass by dividing it with the total number of transactions for an individual member. Hence, we got the circulation matrix which is feature vectors consist of the proportion of transactions that a member made in each subclass from their total transactions  D  Patron Clustering Based on Library Circulation Activities K-Means algorithm The K-means algorithm is the most prominent clustering technique measuring the distance between each data object and the centroid \(or medoid of each cluster The data object is assigned to the cluster with the smallest distance The basic K-means algorithm can be described by the following algorithm  Algorithm Basic K-means algorithm  1: Select K points as initial centroids 2 repeat  3 Assigning each instance to its closest centroid 4 Recompute the centroid for each cluster 5 until Centroids do not change   Patron Clustering In order to group the members based on the similarity in circulation activities, we concep tualized and viewed each patron ID as a transaction deal an d the LC call subclass as the items of this transaction. We clustered the members into 10 clusters by using K-means algor ithm of the software WEKA  results of cl ustering are the list of cluster assignments of each individual member. Moreover, the centroid for each cluster is calculated. After that the dominant subclasses in a certain cluster are selected. These subclasses can be detected as the outliers of the normal pr obability plot of centroid values in that cluster and can be represented by the histogram of Fig. 2  Fig.2 Histogram of the cluster centroid. The dominant subclass is the subclass having the significant high degree of transactions Finally, the dominant subclasses will be assigned to be the representative name for the cluster. For example, the cluster with high centroid of QA was named as Mathematics group  E  Association Rule Generation for Interest Patterns Discovery Association Analysis The example of association rule analysis was originally proposed in the common probl em known as market basket transactions for discovering hidden purchase patterns in a large transaction data Let I= {i 1 i 2 i d  be the set of all items in a market basket data and T={t 1   t 2 t N  be the set of all transactions. Each transaction t i contains a subset of items in I An association rule is an implication expression of the form XY where X  and Y are disjoint itemsets, and X  I and Y  I The importance of an association rule is measured in terms of support and confidence. The support value of the rule XY is the fraction of transactions containing both X and Y while its confidence value is the fraction of transactions containing Y to the transactions containing X  al definitions of support and confidence can be represented by Eq.1      Confidence   Support X Y X N Y X        1 The value of support is an important feature to define the popular patterns. Whereas the confidence measure the reliability of the inference made by a rule. For example, the high confidence of the rule XY means that it is the high 391 


possibility that Y will be presented in the transactions containing X   for m i ning association rules This strategy control th e exponential growth of candidate itemsets based on the support measure called support-based pruning. In order to eliminat e the uninteresting itemsets, we need to setup the support threshold value. Initially, every item will be considered and the candidate item with lower support than the threshold will be discarded. Next, the algorithm will iteratively generate new candidates of k itemsets by using only the frequent itemsets found in the previous step and calculate their support values. Th e itemsets with low support value will be eliminates. The alg orithm terminates when there are no new frequent itemsets generated. Finally, the association rules are generated from the frequent itemsets The rules are generated by partitioning frequent item Y into two sets X and Y-X and calculate the confidence of rule XY-X The rules with low confidence may be discarded. Fig 3 shows the example of association rules generation from the frequent itemset Y={a,b,c,d We can see that, there are 14 possible rules generated from this frequent itemset  Frequent itemset abcd bcd -> a acd -> b abd -> c abc -> d cd -> ab bd -> ac bc -> ad ad -> bc ac -> bd ab -> cd d -> abc c -> abd b -> acd a -> bcd  Fig.3 Association rules generation from the frequent itemset Y={a,b,c,d Tertius is another algorithm for extracting the implicit unusual, or interesting rules. Th e idea of this algorithm is to measure how strongly the rule is confirmed by determining the number of instances that satisfy the rule together with the number of counter-instances of th For exam ple, to  consider the confirmation of the rule mother\(X,Y female\(X\we will focus on the number of counterinstances of this rule which is the number of instances satisfy fe male\(X\ can be run by setting the following values   Confirmation threshold: the minimal confirmation of the accepted rule AB   Noise threshold and frequency threshold  are the maximal and minimal frequencies of the counterinstances of the role AB Association Rules of the Circulation Activity After clustering patron based on their similarity of interest to discover the relatio nships of interesting patterns of patrons in a cluster, we apply associatio n rules for analyzing the transaction data. The steps of association rule generation start from quantizing the number of transactions in a circulation matrix into 3 levels of interest: low, medium, and high according to the distribution of our gathered data. In this work we used the following criteria for assigning levels of interest   The level of interest is lo w, if the proportion of transaction that a member made in each subclass is less than or equal to 0.1   The level of interest is medium, if the proportion of transaction that a member made in each subclass is higher than 0.1 but less than or equal to 0.4   The level of interest is high, if the proportion of transaction that a member made in each subclass is higher than 0.4 Hence, we got the circulation pattern composing of the nominal scale for representing the degree of interest in different book categories. The matr ix of interesting degree of patrons in each cluster is the input data for generating cluster association rules. By matching the appropriate association rule to the past transactions of each patron in a cluster, we can predict their futu re requirements F  Discovery of Cluster Memberês Preferences In this study, we generated the book recommendation list by analyzing the past transacti ons performed by all members in each group and f ind the characteristic of book that favored by the majority of members  Our collaborative member preference task generates the similar interested information among members in a specific cluster. The similar interested informat ion used in this study includes the favorite title and the favorite authors. These favorite lists are built from the collection of past transactions performed by members within a cluster  Finally, the book recommendation list for each patron is created by selecting the book ite ms having the characteristics that match the favorite lists for exam ple the book from the favorite author. Our book recommendation list contains 10 book titles selected from th e favorite title list, the newest books from the favorite authors, and also includes the new arrival books. The proportion of books for different categories depends on the related association rule of an individual patron For example, the patr on with related association rule as QD=high QA=high will get the recommended book list containing 5 books from QD category and another 5 books from QA category, where the patron with related association rule as QD=high QC=low will get the recommended book list with all of 10 books from QD category III  E XPERIMENTAL RESULTS  A  Patron Clustering by K-means Algorithm By applying K-means algorithm, we clustered the patrons based on the similarity in their library circulation activities 392 


into 10 clusters. The number of members and the dominant subclasses for each cluster are shown in Table IV T ABLE IV T HE RESULTS OF MEMBER CLUSTERING BY KMEANS  Cluster  Member  Dominant subclasses  Representative name  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8   9   10  112  108  57  261  165  204  214  141   698   71  QD  PE  BF  QA  TK  TA  PN  TJ, TP   TS, TP   TJ  Chemistry  English Language  Psychology  Mathematics  Electrical Engineering  Civil Engineering  Literature  Mechanical Engineering Chemical Technology  Manufacturer, Chemical Technology  Mechanical Engineering   The result shows that there are at most two dominant subclasses for each cluster. This result suggests that the members within the same cluster share the common interests in specific domains and differ from the members in other clusters B  Example of Generated Association Rules We generated the association rules for each cluster by using the transaction data of patrons in the cluster. The association rules are generated by Apriori algorithm of WEKA software Because we prefer the variety of rules to support the variety of patron requirements, we setup the low value of support threshold to 0.2 and confidence threshold equals to 0.8 Moreover, we run the Tertius algo rithm to extract the implicit association rules by setup the confirmation threshold equals to 0.1, frequency threshold equals to 0, noise threshold equals to 0.01.

In the questionnaire, we asked the patrons to specify the books from the list of 10 books that highly correlated with his/her interests There are fourteen out of fifty four patrons answered the question. The respondents are divided into 2 groups instructor-researcher, and student \(5 and 9 patrons respectively\ 5 faculties. The total average number of selected books is 4.21 out of ten. The average number of selected books for instructor-researcher group and student group are 3.80 and 4.44, resp ectively. The average number of selected books separated by bo ok properties into favorite title favorite author, and new release can be shown in Fig. 4  393 


 Fig.4 The average number of selected books separated by book properties into favorite title, favorite author, and new release IV  D ISCUSSIONS AND C ONCLUSIONS  The total average number of books selected by the respondents is 4.21 out of ten recommended books \(42.10 This value closes to 38.10% accuracy rate of assigning book recommendation list generated from the expertise information of each respondent in the online bookstore application By considering the large number of books in the library, this number is sufficiently high to specify the scope of books that satisfy the individual The analysis of interesting pattern by association rules can be used to clarify the future requirement of the patron in each cluster.   In Table VI two patrons in cluster 1 which share the common interest of chemistry have different circulation patterns. This leads to di fferent in characteristic of book recommendation list assigned to these patrons The reply of respondents from the computer engineering departments suggests that the pat ron profile should be used in the book recommendation list generation phase to improve the quality of the book recommendation system. As we saw that the instructors and students in this group were more interested in the books with LC call number between QA76.75QA76.765 which related to the compu ter software than the other subclasses  the average number of selected books with LC call number between QA76 75-QA76.765 is 86.16% of their total selected books  The results of patron evaluation also suggest that students are more interested in the favorite title books than the author favorite, and new release books These favorite book titles are the books used in their st udy. Hence, this result can indicate the student demands for the book acquisition process The present study is only the preliminary experiment that reveals the possibility of using circu lation activity history to predict the future interest of an individual member and then provides the b ook recommended lists obtained from the transactions of other members which share the common interest. However, we need to perform the evaluation test with larger number of sample patrons This study has the contri bution in the personalization systems such as the uni versity web portal. Under this circumstance, we not only provide the ways to access the relevant information, but also satisfy the individual requirement A CKNOWLEDGMENT  We would like to thank the Library Management System development team of King Mongkutês University of Technology for providing the hist ory of circulation activity used in this study.
