These huge amount of \nfiles need to be processed by some applications as quickly as \npossible with parallel processing. With the increasing of cores in \nprocessors, parallel programming becomes more complex.

Consequently, this paper proposes a pipeline-\nbased parallel framework for mass file processing, in which file \nprocessing is divided into multiple stages to compose a pipeline. \nFiles flow through these stages one by one, and the interferences \nin file-accessing are avoided. Moreover, the parallel nprogramming can be simplified by means of parallel frameworks \nand programming interfaces.

INTRODUCTION \nWith the rapid development of the Internet and cloud \ncomputing, the requirement for big data processing is \nincreasing especially for mass file processing, such as pictures, \nweb pages, audio and video files. The operations on mass files \nare multifarious and even complex, and need to access file \nsystems and external storage systems frequently and return \nresults timely, all of which pursue high concurrency and low \nlatency. \nNowadays multi-core processors have become common \nand turn to many-core processor direction, so the computing ncapacities of computer systems increase constantly. However, \nthe performance of storage systems does not keep up with this \npace, although parallel file systems and advanced memory \nhierarchies have been developed Mass file processing needs \nfrequent access to storage systems, which may exacerbate this \nproblem. To solve such problem, on the one hand, multi-core \nand many-core resources should be fully utilized, and the nperformance of file systems should be improved as much as \npossible. On the other hand, due to increased cores in \nprocessors, programmers require efficient parallel \nprogramming methods to take full advantage of multi-core or \nmany-core processors. However, writing multi-thread/multi-\nprocess parallel programs manually is complicated, and \nmultiple parallel processes/threads accessing to the storage \nsystem simultaneously may interfere with each other and cause \nextra performance loss. \nFor the purpose of enhancing access to mass files, reducing \ninterferences among multiple parallel processes/threads and \nsimplifying parallel programming, we propose pipeline-based \nparallel framework for mass file processing. This framework \nemploys pipeline to divide file processing into several stages, \nthrough which files flow one by one, so many files can be \nprocessed concurrently. In prefetching stage, pipeline achieves \nmore accurate and predictable file accessing by informed \nprefetching[1]. In addition, we provide convenient \nprogramming interfaces for pipeline framework to \nprogrammers. \nThe main contributions of this paper include: i pipeline-architecture into mass file processing that \ncan both parallelize file processing and reduce the interferences \nbetween processes/threads in file accessing; ii programming interfaces, \nachieving underlying parallelization in runtime library, which \ncan free programmers from writing complex parallel programs \nmanually. \nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section I nintroduce this paper work. Section II briefly reviews the related \nworks. Section III outlines the motivation of pipeline-based \nparallel framework for mass file processing. In Section IV, we \nprovide the implementation of pipeline framework, and present \npipeline framework’s programming interfaces. Experimental \nresults from one real-world application and micro-benchmarks \nare presented in Section V. The paper closes with a conclusion \nand future work in Section VI. \nII. RELATED WORK \nAt present, there are a lot of work focused on big data \n\(e.g., mass file processing system and optimization, e.g., \n[2], [3] and [4]. [3] proposes a multi-layer prefetching \nalgorithm that can judiciously prefetch data from tapes to \nHDDs and from HDDs to SSDs, which can improve file \nprocessing efficiency in the view of file system optimization. \nFrom the perspective of parallel programming, H. T. Kung et al. \n2013 International Conference on Cloud and Service Computing\n978-0-7695-5157-9/13 $31.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/CSC.2013.15\n42\nproposes a speculative pipeline-based scheduling strategy that \nfits to mass file processing [5], and it uses speculative \nprefetching to minimize execution delays in stages, which ndepends on MapReduce programming model [6]. Speculative \nprefetching used in [5] perhaps is not very accurate to fetch the \ndata or files to be executed. \nIn multi-core/many-core era, parallel programming model \nis a requirement. For simplifying parallel programming and \nimproving efficiency, we apply DSL [7] [8], generally includes \ndomain language, parallel framework and specific library, to \ndo cooperative work, e.g., Merge [9 and StreamIt [10]. Merge \nis a general-purpose programming framework for \nheterogeneous multicore systems 


using a rigorous, library-\nbased approach to automatically distribute tasks to \nheterogeneous processor cores Within the streaming domain, \nStreamIt provides novel high-level representations to improve \nprogrammer productivity and program robustness. [9] presents \na generic software framework for a line-buffer-based image nreconstruction pipeline, which can reduce memory \nconsumption and support a wide variety of image processing nalgorithms. \nPipeline is an important programming model or \nframework. It can be used to simplify parallel programming, \nespecially for large-scale software development [11]. \nPipelining decomposes a complex problem into small stages so \nthat programs can run in different stages efficiently. \nConsequently, pipeline parallelism is proven to increase \nparallelism, improve cache locality, and increase power \nefficiency [12 nIII. MOTIVATION \nWith increasing cores in processor, we should accelerate \nthe speed of mass file processing by effectively utilizing multi-\ncore/many-core resources and parallel programming models. \nNevertheless parallel programming for mass file processing on \nmulti-core/many-core platforms faces several problems nFirst of all, because of the performance gap between \nprocessor and storage system, computing power, storage nsystem and I/O performance do not match with each other. \nWhen multiple parallel processes/threads access to the storage \nsystem simultaneously, file and storage system may become \nthe bottlenecks of the entire system In most of the time, \nprocesses/threads are in blocked state to wait for file access \ncompleted, making processors in idle state, which is a waste of \ncomputing resource. Mass file processing has to access to nstorage system frequently, which may prolong I/O delay. \nFurthermore, access behaviors may interfere with each other in \ncache buffer management, prefetching calculation of file \nsystem and storage system, resulting in system performance \ndegradation. \nSecondly, parallel programming is hard to write. \nProgrammers not only consider module division, program \ncontrol flow and logic as writing serial programs, but are also \nconfronted with a range of issues in order to guarantee \nparallelism, such as reasonable data partitioning, parallel task nsynchronization, and exclusive access to shared data. For \ninstance, an unnecessary lock operation in a parallel program \nperhaps leads to only one thread/process running but other ones \nblocking, causing program performance dropped. Conversely, \nremoving the lock in the program may significantly improve \nthe system performance. In brief, parallel programs are more \ndifficult and complex to write than serial programs nTherefore, it is necessary to design a parallel programming \nframework for mass file processing that can take full advantage \nof multi-core/many-core processors to improve I/O \nperformance, and simplify parallel programming. A bit of \nimprovement may bring enormous benefits for mass file \nprocessing. \nIV. PIPELINE-BASED PARALLELIZATION FOR MASS FILE \nPROCESSING \nPipeline divides an iteration of a loop into distinct stages \nof work. All stages are scheduled such that they can run \nconcurrently [13]. The output of a previous stage is treated as \nthe input of the next stage. For mass file processing, we split \ncomplicated mass file processing into multiple parallel stages, \nand ensure that at least one process/thread is working in each \nstage. The different processes/threads are working in different \nstages, which can make full use of multi-core/many-core nresources efficiently and process multiple files concurrently. \nPipeline-based parallelization for mass file processing \ndivides mass file processing into multi-stages, basically, \nincluding prefetching stage, computing stage, and result \ngeneration stage. If computing stage is multifarious and \ncomplex, it can be split into sub computing stages. Prefetching \nstage is responsible for prefetching files; computing stage takes \ncharge of processing and computing files; file results are \nreturned in result generation stage. At least one process/thread \nruns in computing stage and result generation stage \nrespectively. \nA. Pipeline Architecture nNormal processing for mass file processing is equal to \nserial processing that goes through I/O reading computing, \nresult generation stages generally.  \nThis paper assumes that the applications employing our npipeline framework are I/O bound, which means the time of \nprefetching stage is the longest among all the stages of pipeline \nframework.  \nAs Fig.1 shows, in normal processing, File 2 can be \ncomputed after I/O 2 and until this time, the processors are in \nan idle state, which is a waste of computing resource. For mass nfile processing, there should be a huge waste. In comparison, as \npipeline processing in Fig.1, we divide pipeline into \nprefetching stage, computing stage and result generation stage. \nWhen File 1 is in computing stage, File 2 has been prefetched \ninto memory. Prefetching file ahead of time hides the gap \nbetween I/O and computing capabilities. For example, in \nnormal processing, File 2 is to be computed at t1, while the \ntime is t2 in pipeline processing. Time saved of one single file \nis \(t1-t2 is N* \(t1-t2 pipeline processing. \n \n \nFig. 2. Files in Pipeline. \nPipeline for mass file processing has the ability to manage \nmultiple files simultaneously. Fig.2 shows the files in one \npipeline. Every stage can process multiple files respectively. \nComputing stage could be divided into sub stages if file \ncomputing is complex The processes/threads running in stages \nprocess file concurrently, combining with prefetching function \nof 


pipeline, can improve I/O performance and utilize multi-\ncore/many-core resources efficiently. \nB. Pipeline Implementation \n \nFig. 3. Detail implementation of pipeline. \nAs Fig.3 shows, basically, pipeline for mass file \nprocessing is spilt into prefetching stage, computing stage, and \nresult generation stage, and each stage has a deque for caching \ndata. \nPrefetching, an effective method to improve system's I/O \nperformance is that system executes I/O operation and loads \ndata from external storage to memory in advance. Compared nwith traditional serial programs, this approach essentially \nexplores the concurrency of computation and I/O accesses, thus \nthe processor stall time on I/O accesses can be masked as well. \nMost existing prefetching schemes fall into two categories: \npredictive or informed prefetching. The former infers likely \nblock accesses based on past I/O system call patterns. The \nlatter uses hints provided by applications to inform file systems \nof future data block requirements [14]. Predictive prefetching \nhas some inevitable limitations Because it is usually located in \nthe lower level of system and can only prefetch data according \nto local information, lack of enough supports from upper level, \nthe accuracy of prefetching is difficult to ensure For this \nreason, we adopt informed prefeching as the first stage of \npipeline for mass file processing, and the prefetching details \nare notified by applications from upper level of the system. \nIn prefetching stage application provides prefetching \ninformation explicitly, e.g. the paths of prefetching files \(as the nFilelist in Fig.3 to prefetch \nfiles from external storage to buffer \(queue the efficiency of prefetching, the \nnumber of prefetching files for pipeline is more than one, \ndepending on the buffer size. According to the file list, the files \nwill be prefetched from the mass file external storage system to \nthe buffer, waiting for being processed by next stage. \nComputing stage could be divided into sub computing \nstages in case that file processing is complex. Sub stages are \nstill pipeline architecture. In Fig.3, computing stage is \ncomposed of computing I, computing II, … , computing N. \nThe number of sub stages are decided by programmers, and \nhad better not be deep, for preventing performance degradation. \nWhen computing stage is processing files, prefetching stage is \nnot affected and prefetches files concurrently from external \nstorage system to the buffer. For less computing file processing, \npipeline may apply fewer sub computing stages and every \nstage employs one process/thread. The framework in this paper \nuses one thread in each stage. Results are produced by result \ngeneration stage. \n44\n1 Class intermediateResultSet \n2{ \n3 intermediateResultSet  Type* intermediateResult_2 = new intermediateResult_2 new intermediateResult_N  intermediateResult_1; \n13       delete intermediateResult_2; \n14        ... \n15       delete intermediateResult_N; \n16    } \n17 } \nFig. 4. Class IntermediateResultSet. \nTo guarantee pipeline efficiency pointers that point to \nintermediate result set are saved in buffers. Intermediate result \nset includes diverse results of different stages. At the beginning \nof program, pipeline allocates memory space for all the nintermediate results once to avoid memory scheduling \(pseudo-\ncode is shown in Fig.4 processing results, \nclasses IntermediateResultSet will be immediately destructed. \nFor mass file processing there are a lot of files but they have \nsmall sizes. Prefetching stage is the most time-consuming part \nof pipeline\( mentioned in Section IV, Part A because of the \nstrong computing power of multi-core/many-core and I/O \ndelay. Consequently, files in pipeline flows quickly, and will \nnot take up memory for a long time. Therefore, one-time \nallocating space for the intermediate results of each file is \nfeasible and efficient. \n \nFig. 5. Pipeline buffer. \nFor parallel programming, the exclusive accesses of \nmultiple processes/threads to share data, as well as \nsynchronizations between them will impact program \nperformance seriously. According to [15], [16], Lamport has \nproved that under sequential consistency, the locks could be \nremoved from the single-producer/single-consumer \(SP/SC ncase, resulting in a concurrent lock-free \(CLF calculations, one \nthread is used in each stage. For pipeline framework, the input \nof buffer \(queue considered as a producer while the \noutput is a consumer, and totally, it is SP/SC \(Single \nProducer/Single Consumer Multi-\nProducer/Multi-Consumer multi-processes/threads’ \nreadings and writings. For mass file processing, SP/SC is more \nefficient than MP/MC. Thus, we employ the SP/SC method \n\(red color in Fig.5 processing, such \nas starting multiple pipelines for mass file processing \nsimultaneously to process mass file more rapidly. \nC. Programming Interface \nTo resolve the difficulty of parallel programming, it is \nessential to develop appropriate abstractions so that \nprogrammers can write high-level code and do not worry about 


nlow-level details that negatively impact productivity. Thus, \nthere is a need for parallel heterogeneous programming models \n[8] .We develop programming interfaces named PMFP \n\(Pipeline-based parallel framework for Mass File Processing are shown in Fig.6. \n1 void PMFP_Init\( int stageNumber int FileNumber PMFP_CompStage\(bool onlyOneCompStage, int index  interfaces. \nThe PMFP_Init initializes threads and buffers of all the \nstages, and programmers should provide the stage number of \nthe pipeline. A call to PMFP_PrefetchStage with file number \nas its argument is as the first stage of pipeline, and prefething \nfile paths should be provided in this function. Then, a call to nPMFP_CompStage expresses computing stage of the pipeline. \nWhen bool variable onlyOneCompStage is true, that means \nonly one computing stage in pipeline, and its index is 1; if it’s \nfalse, that means more than one step in computing stage, and \nthe index should be the actual total number of computing stage. \nPMFP_ResultGenStage is used to generate results of pipeline. \nV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS \nA. Experimental Setup \nWe evaluate pipeline framework for mass file processing \nin this paper using one real-world application and a bank of nmicro-benchmarks. Parallelized program speedups are \nmeasured using a large input set on a PC with 8-thread Intel i7-\n2600 quad-core, 4G memory and Seagate Barracuda \nST3500418AS \( 500 GB, 7200 RPM, 16MB Cache, SATA n3.0GB/s 3.5" Internal Hard Drive gcc \ncompiler version 4.4.6. The experiments take an amount of \ntime, and the performance times are average execution times \nover 5 runs. \nB. Bzip2 \nBzip2 is a freely available, patent free, high-quality data ncompressor [17]. “It uses the Burrows–Wheeler transform to \nconvert frequently-recurring character sequences into strings of \nidentical letters. It then applies move-to-front transform and \nHuffman coding “[18]. It is an I/O bound application for a \n45\nnumber of files [19]. We use PMFP to parallel Bzip2 into \nprefetching computing and result generation stages. \n   \nFig. 7. Pipeline speedup vs. serial \(Bzip2 includes about 600,000 images \(from Baidu \nCompany, and average size is about 100k nspeedup with serial with Bzip2. As Fig.7 shows, as the number \nof files increasing, the speedup is rising as well until to a flat \ntrend. When the number is 300,000, the speedup is 2.34x. If \nreaching the max number 600,000 all the threads \nrun the same serial code, but on different data. This technique \nhas similarities with data parallelization  n \nFig. 8. Homogeneous parallelization vs. Pipeline \(Bzip2 times \nbetween one pipeline and three homogeneous parallelization \nthreads for different image numbers. The red line means the \ntime ratios of homogeneous parallelization and pipeline, and \nthe average value is about 1.6x. The results illustrate that \npipeline is more efficient than homogeneous parallelization. \nThe reason is that, when 3 homogeneous parallelization threads \nare reading files from external storage concurrently, there are \ninterferences among them, while the pipeline only has only one \nthread to do prefetching and without competitions. \nBzip2 pipeline’s pseudo-code for processing 10,000 files \n\(images stages number is 3, and \ncomputing stage number is 1.

The file sizes we tested are 10k, 50k, 100k, 200k, \n500k, 1M, and file numbers are range from 1,000 to 600,000. \nPrefetching time for a single file less than 1M is about n10ms~12ms [21]. Consequently, we designed a pipeline with 3 \nstages, and computing and result generation stages both need \n10ms. Fig.10 presents one micro-benchmark’s pseudo-code. \n1 void PMFP_Init\( 3 PMFP_PrefetchStage\( 10000 1, 0 traversing the data in a file for 10ms;} \n6 void PMFP_ResultGenStage 10ms;} \nFig. 10.

While the file size is 50k prefetching time is about \n10ms as well, and equal to the other two stages, so it has the \nhighest speedup n46\n Fig. 12. Homogeneous parallelization vs. Pipeline \nFig.12 shows the time ratios of homogeneous nparallelization and pipeline in different file sizes. The result \nshows that one pipeline made of 3 threads is more efficient \nthan 3 homogeneous parallelization threads. The reason is that \n3 homogeneous threads read data from disk concurrently, the \nmagnetic head of which causes shared resource contention, so \nthe threads interfere with each other. One pipeline has only one \nthread to read data from disk without resource

That is because \nthat the times of prefetching one file \(from 50k to 1000k  1ms and 5ms. The pipelines with \nstages taking 10ms have the best performances. For Fig.13 \(a is 10k, and the prefetching time is closer to 5ms, \nand pipeline with stages taking 5ms is better than other two \nones. Therefore, when all the stages take approximately the \nsame time, the pipeline may be the most efficient. Thus, \nprogrammers should ensure the load balance in all stages of \npipeline in the design of programs. \nVI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK \nThis paper presents a pipeline-based parallel framework for \nmass file processing. In this framework, a large number of files \ncan be concurrently processed by some applications as quickly \nas possible. File processing is divided into multiple stages to \ncompose a pipeline with files flowing through these stages one \nby one. Moreover, parallelization is achieved while ninterferences in file-accessing are avoided. The programming \ninterfaces this framework provided also simplify parallel \nprogramming and make it more efficient. Evaluation results \nshow that pipeline-based parallel framework for mass file \nprocessing achieves satisfied performance and scalability. \nIn the future we plan to apply pipeline-based parallel \nframework for mass file processing in distributed data \nprocessing systems, such as Hadoop [23], etc., in which \nmultiple pipelines can also be employed. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThis work is supported by the Natural Science Foundation \nof China under Grant No. 61073011 and 61133004, National nHigh-Tech Research and Development Program of China \nunder Grant No. 2011AA01A205. \nREFERENCES \n[1 Patterson, R.H., Gibson, G.A., Ginting,E., Stodolsky, D., Zelenka, Jim., \n“Informed prefetching and caching Proceedings of the fifteenth ACM \nsymposium on Operating systems principles \(SOSP  J., Sun, XH. ,Thakur, R., “KNOWAC: I/O Prefetch via \nAccumulated Knowledge”, IEEE International Conference on Cluster \nComputing \(CLUSTER  Exploring \nParallel I/O Concurrency with Speculative Prefetching”, 37th \nInternational Conference on Parallel Processing \(ICPP  for \nHybrid Storage Systems: Algorithms, Models, and Evaluations”, 39th \nInternational Conference on Parallel Processing Workshops \(ICPPW  Speculative Pipelining \nfor Compute Cloud Programming”, Military Communications \nConference \(MILCOM pp: 2026-2034.    \n[6] Dean, J., Ghemawat, S., “Mapreduce: simplified data processing on \nlarge clusters”, 6th Symposium on Operating Systems Design and \nImplementation \(OSDI  J., Sloane, A.M., “When and how to develop \ndomain-specific languages”, ACM Computing Surveys \(CSUR nVol.37 No.4, pp: 316-344.  \n[8] Chafi, H., Sujeeth, A.K., Brown, K.J., Lee, H., Atreya, A.R., Olukotun, \nK A domain-specific approach to heterogeneous parallelism”,  \nProceedings of the 16th ACM symposium on Principles and practice of \nparallel programming \( PPoPP  Wang H., Meng, T.H., “Merge: a \nprogramming model for heterogeneous multi-core systems”, \nProceedings of the 13th international conference on Architectural \nsupport for programming languages and operating systems n\(ASPLOS  Streaming Applications”, Proceedings of the 11th International \nConference on Compiler Construction \(CC 2002, pp:179-196.  \n[11] Bienia, C., Li, K., “Characteristics of workloads using the pipeline \nprogramming model”, Proceedings of the 2010 international conference \non Computer Architecture \(ISCA n[12] Gordon, M.I., Thies, W., Amarasinghe, S., “Exploiting coarse-grained \ntask, data, and pipeline parallelism in stream programs”, Proceedings of \nthe 12th international conference on Architectural support for \nprogramming languages and operating systems \(ASPLOS  M.K., Khubaib, N.Patt, Y., “Feedback-\nDirected Pipeline Parallelism”, Proceedings of the 19th international nconference on Parallel architectures and compilation techniques \(PACT  Alghamdi, M., Al Assaf, M., Ruan, X., Ding, Z., Qin, X., “An \nAutomatic Prefetching and Caching System Performance Computing \nand Communications Conference \(IPCCC  Specifying concurrent program modules”, ACM \nTransactions on Programming Languages and Systems \(TOPLAS 1983, \nVol.5 No.2, pp: 190-222.  \n[16] Giacomoni, J., Moseley, T., Vachharajani, M., “FastForward for

Codeword buffering delay – we assume the \ncodeword frame synchronization mechanism will \nrequire 3 code frames to acquire and to confirm \nframe sync.  Let R denote the data rate.  Thus the \ncodeword buffering delay for DSN missions and \nSN/NEN missions are 3x2048/R and 3x4500/R \nrespectively \(in unit of seconds 


Frame buffering delay – we assume a Space Link \nExtension \(SLE acquired and confirmed in one frame.  \nThus the frame buffering delay is 10240/R \(in unit \nof seconds Ground transmission delay – from prior statistics \nfor DSN data delivery over the NISN lines, we \nobserve that the long-haul latency between DSN \nsites and JPL Central is approximately 2 times the \npropagation delay.  As ground transmission latency \nis a small fraction compared to the other delays, we \nuse the rough estimation of two times propagation \ndelay to model the ground transmission delay.   \n \nUsing the Straight-Forward Leveling Scheme we estimate \nthe link sizes of the network paths of the four ISE options \nfor the “base” case and high” case traffic scenarios, both \nfor bulk science latency requirements of 1 hour and 8 hours nrespectively.  The aggregated WAN bandwidths of the four \nISE options for both cases are given in Tables 1 and 2.   \n \n \nTable 1: Aggregated WAN Bandwidths \(Gbps Straight-Forward \nLeveling Scheme \n \n \nTable 2: Aggregated WAN Bandwidths \(Gbps Eight Hours, Straight-Forward \nLeveling Scheme \n \nSimilarly we apply the 2-State Markov Leveling Scheme, \nand the aggregated WAN bandwidths of the four ISE \noptions for the base and high cases are given in Table 3 \n\(with bulk science latency of 1 hour with bulk \nscience latency of 8 hours Aggregated WAN Bandwidths \(Gbps nTable 4: Aggregated WAN Bandwidths \(Gbps Scheme \n \nTo validate the accuracy of the leveling schemes, we choose \nthe DSN’s GSS-MOC links for the ISE option-1 for the case \nwhen the bulk science latency requirement is one hour, and \ncompare the bandwidth estimates generated by the Straight-\nForward Leveling Scheme and those generated by direct \nsimulation using MACHETE10.

All other links are store-and-forward links, and the \nlink sizes are driven by the combined effects of nmission data rates, data types with different latency \nrequirements, and duty cycles.   \n3. For ISE-3 and ISE-4, the aggregated WAN \nbandwidths are insensitive to data type latency \nrequirements as their WAN bandwidths are \ndominated by the real-time GSS-INOC links.   \n4. For ISE-4 with two different bulk science latency \nrequirements, the aggregated WAN bandwidths for \nthe high-case are only 20% higher than those of the nnominal case.  This is because the ISE-4 WAN \nbandwidths are dominated by GSS-INOC links that \ntransport RF/IF samples, and are independent of \nthe data rates.   \n5. For ISE-3, ISE-4, and ISE-5, the aggregated WAN nbandwidths of the “high” case are approximately \nthree times as those of the “base” case.  This is nconsistent with the fact that the “high” case \nconsists of future mission data rates that are 3 times \nthose of the “base” case.   \n6. The WAN bandwidths of ISE-3 and ISE-4 are \nmuch higher than those of ISE-1 and ISE-2.   \n \n \nV. CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE WORK \n \nIn this paper, we describe new leveling schemes to model \nthe traffic flow and buffering mechanism of a large-scale \nstore-and-forward network.  We apply these techniques to \nestimate the wide area network \(WAN options of the \nproposed Integrated Space Communication and Navigation \n\(ScaN improve the fidelity \nof the leveling schemes and enhance the INA Study are as \nfollows:   \n1. Use statistical description to define link bandwidth \nrequirements.  The current analysis uses the min-\nmax approach to estimate the link sizes of a \nnetwork as described in Section 4.  A better \napproach to quantify the link sizes is to describe \nthe individual link size in terms of mean and \nvariance based on the simulated traffic that flows \nthrough the link.  By invoking the Gaussian \nassumption and using the 2nd order statistics ngathered from the traffic flow simulation, one can \nspecify the link sizes based on the statistical nconfidence level to prevent overflow.   \n2. Provide data type modeling for each individual \nmission.  The current analysis makes blanket \nassumptions on mission data types across all the \nmissions as described in 


Section 4.  When data \ntype allocation information is available for an \nindividual mission, we can implement the specific \ndata type allocation for that particular mission to \nimprove the simulation fidelity.   \n3 Include other latency contributions.  The current \nanalysis only models the store-and-forward delay \nbased on the latency requirements of the data types, \nwhich accounts for the majority of the latency in \nthe data delivery operation.  We can improve the \naccuracy of the analysis by modeling the additional \nlatency contribution of codeword buffering delay, \nframe buffering delay, and ground transmission \ndelay as described in Section 4.   \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \nThe authors would like to thank John Segui for his \nengineering and simulation support, and Loren Clare for his \ninsightful comments.

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
