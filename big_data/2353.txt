If a web page is\ndelivered to a user but the ad fails to load in time, the\npublisher cannot charge the advertiser for that impression.\nDetecting whether a speci?c ad will render in time could give\nthe publisher a choice to show that ad or another one Further,\ndiscovering the root causes of latency, possibly over time as\nnew violators emerge, would allow the publisher to address\nthe actionable issues. We propose a system that predicts, at\nserve time, which ads are likely to have high latency. Once\nidenti?ed we can either ignore those ads, even if they win the\nauction, or apply a penalty to those ads. In addition, our system\ncollects the daily impression logs, consisting of different types of\nobservations measured at serve time and the associated latency\nin milliseconds, and analyzes the data to identify the features\nassociated with late ads and likely to be causing the delay.\nKeywords-ad latency; classi?cation; big data; mapreduce;\nI. INTRODUCTION\nAs computers and network speeds have increased, users\nnow expect web pages to load seemingly instantaneously.\nAlong with wanting content to arrive quickly, websites want\nto ensure ads are also delivered promptly since sites cannot\ncharge advertisers for ads that never show. Improving ad\nload times will ultimately improve both the user experience\nand the revenue for sites.\nThe online advertising world consists of advertisers, or-\nganizations wishing to advertise a product, service or event;\npublishers, who run the websites and want to supplement\ntheir income; and ad exchanges, to connect the participants\ntogether and create a marketplace.\nStudies of user responses to page load times indicate that\nusers prefer faster loading pages [1 For users who are likely\nto engage with an advertisement, having an ad display sooner\nmeans the user has a chance to see the ad before becoming\nimmersed in the page content. Even for a user who will\nnot engage with an ad, having the completed page ?nish\nrendering quickly will avoid a potentially distracting page\nchange as a white space placeholder is suddenly ?lled after\nstarting to consume the page’s content.\nFinancially, the impact of slow ads is clear. If an ad\ntakes too long to load, the user may navigate away from\nthe page before seeing the advertisement. This results in a\nmissed opportunity for the advertiser and lost revenue for\nthe publisher.\nIn this work, we consider two ways to use machine\nlearning to analyze latency data from Yahoo’s ad serving\nsystem to reduce the impact of ad latency. Only a small\nportion of traf?c has been instrumented to record ad latency\ndata but Yahoo’s large scale means that even with a small\nsampling rate we still have tens of millions of records per\nday.\nFor the ?rst method, we perform of?ine analysis on recent\ndelivery data to identify the largest factors contributing to\nslow ad rendering times. Second, we propose a run-time\nsystem to predict when ads are likely to be late. Using\nsuch a system, we could choose to bypass ads with a high\nprobability of being late, even when selling the impression\nslot via auction.\nII. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION\nIn the ad latency setup, the input space is de?ned by a\nfeature vector x ? X , and the output is de?ned as a latency\nvalue in milliseconds y ? Y . The problem can be formulated\nas a binary classi?cation problem with labels c ? {0, 1} by\nthresholding. An ad is de?ned as being late, where c = 1,\nif the time between an ad request and the ad rendering is\nmore than ? milliseconds.\nLet D = {\(xn, cn sample\ndata, where N is our total number of records, xn is a K-\ndimensional feature vector of observations measured at ad\nserving time and cn is the latency indicator. Our goal is\nboth to learn a predictive model that maps x to a latency\nindicator f\(x measured features.\nThese two goals can be achieved simultaneously if a\nvisualizable and interpretable model with good prediction\npower [2] is used, such as logistic regression [3] or decision\ntrees [4].\nAn observation x consists of user features, advertiser\nfeatures, publisher features and temporal features. Table I\nshows speci?c features and their cardinalities. Some sensi-\ntive information is omitted \(marked as X features include features extracted from the\nbrowser’s user agent: the user’s device type, operating\nsystem browser, and whether or not the user is likely a\n2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data\n978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 762\nTable I: Ad latency feature categories and cardinalities\ntype feature card. feature card.\nUser\ndevice 15 OS 22\nbrowser 100 robot 2\nCS 10 country ?215\nstate ?261 city 5583\nISP ?3774 distance to DC numeric\nAdvertiser account X creative Xad size \(dim in KB numeric\nPublisher\nproperty X page on property X\nad position 28 DC X\nhostname X ad network X\nserve type X\nTime time 24 day of week 7\nrobot.

the\ncreative; and the size of the advertisement, both the 2-D\ndimensions of a creative and byte size. A single advertiser\nmay have multiple creatives, so some of these features are\nhierarchical.\nThe publisher speci?c features include the property on\nwhich the ad is shown \(in this case, limited to Yahoo-owned\nsites, e.g. Mail or Homepage e.g. compose new email the ad is shown \(e.g. top or right and\nthe data center used to process the ad request.\nWe use a one-hot encoding for our categorical features,\nmeaning each feature with cardinality k is mapped to k\nmutually exclusive binary features. The exact number of\nfeatures varies day to day, but the feature dimensionality\nis typically larger than 20, 000.\nWe use logistic regression, where the feature vector x\nis parameterized using a weight vector w, where large\npositive weights are associated with a higher likelihood\nof latency and large negative weights are associated with\na lower likelihood of latency. Using such a model, we\ncan provide feedback to publishers, advertisers and even\nthe exchange about the sources of latency. Examples of\nthe desired analysis could range from: “ads are late in\ngeographical region X ,” to “ads are late on a particular\ndevice Y and browser Z,” or “serving ads from data center\nW is problematic”.\nIII. METHODOLOGY\nA. Logistic Regression\nThe assumptions involved in logistic regression are sim-\nilar to those involved with any linear model, namely the\nexistence of a linear relationship between the inputs and\nthe output. In the case of logistic regression, we assume\nthat the posterior class probabilities can be estimated as a\nlinear function of the inputs x, passed through a sigmoidal\nfunction,\nP \(c = 1|x w0 +\nK?\nk=1\nwk · xk 1 c = 0|x c = 1|x ML The likelihood\nfunction of the data D is given by\np\(D|w cn|xn,w 1? ?n 2 cn = 1|xn 1??n probability of\nclass 0 when cn = 0, and to the posterior class probability\nof class 1 when cn = 1. In order to nd the ML estimate\nof the parameters, we form the log-likelihood,\nl = log p\(D|w cn log?n + \(1? cn log \(1? ?n 3 in K+1 unknowns, so\nwe do not expect a closed form solution. Hence, the usual\napproach is to apply the gradient descent \(GD estimates can also\nbe calculated to minimize the mean squared error \(MSE prediction f\(x,w w0 +\n?K\nk=1 wk · xk cn ? f\(xn,w 4 gradient descent or similar\noptimization algorithms.\nTo avoid over?tting, one can use regularization, such as\n2 or 1. Applying 2 regularization, adding ?2?w?2 to the\nloss function, forces the values of the parameter vector to\nhave low values, thereby ensuring that no one dimension can\nhave an overwhelming in?uence in classi?cation. Using 1\nregularization, adding ?1?w?1 to the loss function, induces\nsparsity in the parameter vector, reducing the feature space\nto a subset of features that are the most predictive This\nreduces the complexity of prediction which results in a faster\nprediction speed. Hyperparameters ?2 > 0 and ?1 > 0 can\nbe selected based on the problem requirements and require\ntuning.\nIn case of a class imbalance where examples of one class\nin a data set vastly outnumber examples of the other class,\n763\none can add weights per example mn to the loss function,\nbased on the proportion of the two classes in the data.\nThe ?nal problem that we tackle, including sample\nweights and regularization is of the form\nmin\nw?RK\n1\nN\nN?\nn=1\nmn\(cn f\(xn,w w 5 yˆn = f\(xn,w  yˆn threshold ? is usually set to\n0.5, f\(xn,w to ensure a desired False Positive\nRate \(FPR TPR implementations of different\noptimization techniques for solving problem \(5 such as stochastic and \(mini truncated Newton methods, trust region, and\nnonlinear conjugate gradient descent. An overview of differ-\nent optimization techniques for logistic regression is given\nin [5].\nB. Performance Metrics\nTo evaluate the performance of our ad latency model, we\nused a test set of labeled ad serving observations, disjoint\nfrom the training set, consisting of both late and non-late\nads.\nThe true positive rate, TPR, is de?ned as\nTPR nn1\nN1\n· 100, \(6 of late ad examples in\nthe test data.\nSimilarly, the false positive rate, FPR, is given as\nFPR =\nn0\nN0\n· 100 7 data examples\nin the test data\nFor different values of threshold ? the logistic regression\nmodel can achieve different TPR and FPR performance. By\nsliding the threshold from 0 to 1, both the TPR and the FPR\ndecrease and by plotting these values on a 2-D plane we\nform a Receiver Operating Characteristic \(ROC 


6].\nUsually the threshold is chosen depending on application\nrequirements.\nDuring online ad latency prediction, the publisher typi-\ncally prefers a very low FPR, ensuring that very few ads\nare wrongly classi?ed as late and thus minimally hurting\nrevenue. At the same time, the publisher prefers a high TPR.\nSince these two goals are con?icting, the best strategy is to\nmaximize the area under the ROC curve \(AUC EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nIn this section we present the results of a study of runtime\nprediction of ad latency and the sample output of our\npipeline for of?ine ad latency analysis.\nWe used the Vowpal Wabbit package1 [7] for logistic\nregression. This online-learning library is capable of running\nin a distributed manner on several machines in parallel, as\nwell as on a single machine. We demonstrate the trade-offs\nin time and performance of training on a single machine vs.\ndistributed training on a Hadoop cluster.\nTo address label imbalance, as overwhelming majority of\nour ads are not late, we use weighted learning \(5 the proportion of the classes.\nA. MapReduce and AllReduce\nThe MapReduce [8] abstraction, implemented as an open\nsource platform Hadoop2, has become popular for dis-\ntributed processing of big data. With the growth of data, per-\nforming regular operations and extracting statistics from data\nbecomes impractical with a single machine. The MapReduce\nframework helps to bridge the gap, whether the problem\nis storing all the data points or in memory when trying to\nperform operations on the entirety of data.\nThere are three different ways of utilizing MapReduce for\nmachine learning: 1 single reducer in an online\nlearning manner, without storing the points that are being\nstreamed; 2 several local models on parts of\nthe dataset in multiple mappers and combining the local\nmodels into a global model on a single reducer; and 3 exchange local gradients.\nIn the ?rst option, learning a model takes as long as\nlearning on a single machine The only bene?t is in data\nstorage, speci?cally the fact that you never need to store the\ndataset on a single computer’s disk.\nThe second option is a typically used for batch machine\nlearning algorithms. It requires running several MapReduce\njobs, where the mappers compute gradients and the reducers\nsum them. Thus one MapReduce job is analogous to one\nbatch gradient descent update. This method may be inef-\nfective because each iteration has large overheads \(e.g. job\nscheduling, data transfer, data parsing dozen\niterations often need to be conducted to ensure convergence.\nThe third option, is known as AllReduce 9]. Several\nresearchers in the ?eld have argued that AllReduce is better\nsuited for machine learning algorithms [10]. For solving\nproblems of the form \(5 based algorithm like gradient descent\nor LBFGS [11]. A typical implementation is done by impos-\ning a tree structure on the communicating mappers, where\n1https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal wabbit\n2http://hadoop.apache.org/\n764\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nFALSE POSITIVE RATE  n AUC=0.8894 AUC=0.8465 AUC=0.8350 a ad de?nition consequences\n0 10 20 30 40\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nFALSE POSITIVE RATE nP\nO\nSI\nTI\nVE\n R\nAT\nE \n\(%\n 10,272 features 853 features 72 features b regularization consequences\nFigure 1: Comparison of ad-latency algorithms\nTable II: Performance in terms of AUC\n#mappers avg map time total time AUC\n1 7hr 32min 7hr 32min .8894\n100 1hr 07min 1hr 10min .8893\n500 12min 14min .8891\n1000 6min 8min .8889\nlocal gradients are summed up the tree, and then broadcast\ndown to all mappers. In this approach, all computation\nis done in the mappers; reducers are never used even\nthough an implicit reduce is performed. VW contains an\nimplementation of AllReduce compatible with Hadoop. For\ndetails see [9].\nB. Runtime ad latency classi?cation results\nIn runtime ad latency classi?cation, the goal is to train a\nmodel that can predict in real-time whether or not an ad will\nbe late. If a late ad is detected before being served and an\nalternate ad predicted not to be late is available, the alternate\nad is shown.\nThe model is trained every day on the latest 7 days of\ndata, and updated hourly as new data becomes available.\nVW allows for storing the model in a form that allows\nfor continuation of training. We observed that updating the\nmodel during the day helps in discovering new emerging\ntrends. To reduce the complexity of the trained model and\nensure fast real-time prediction, we use 1 regularization.\nThe initial daily model is trained using VW’s AllReduce\ndistributed learning framework. The resulting model is saved\non a single machine and the hourly training updates are made\non the single machine, since the hourly data are not large\nenough to bene?t from distributed learning.\nFor purposes of experimental evaluation of our ad latency\nmodel in this paper, we used a training set of 1.3 billion\nexamples for training, and a test set of 200 million examples,\ndisjoint from the training set, for evaluating the performance\nDuring runtime ad latency prediction, the publisher typ-\nically prefers a very low FPR, ensuring that very few ads\nare wrongly classi?ed as late and thus minimally hurting\nrevenue. At the same time, the publisher prefers a high TPR.\nSince these two goals are con?icting, the best strategy is to\nmaximize the area under the ROC curve \(AUC 


results of\nsingle machine learning vs. learning on different number\nof machines in a distributed manner. To ensure that Hadoop\nschedules M mappers, we compressed the data into M ?les.\nFrom Table II we can conclude that the running time\ndrastically improves when we make use of the distributed\nlearning implementation. Also, by comparing different num-\nber of mappers, we can conclude that the performance only\nslightly decreases with the larger number of mappers, but\nwith a very large decrease in training time.\nAdditional results are presented in Figure 1. Figure 1a\nshows the ROC curves of the models trained on different\nde?nitions of late \(1, 2 and 3 seconds different values of the 1 regularization\nhyperparameter. Larger 1 values result in a sparser solution.\nSeveral observations can be made. First, it is easier to\ndistinguish between ads that are more or less than 1 second\nlate, than to distinguish between ads that are more or\nless than 2 or 3 seconds late Second, as we increase the\n?1 hyperparameter, the performance degrades slightly but\nwe get a much sparser solution, resulting faster runtime\nprediction. Finally, we observe that for a very low FPR of\n765\nTable III Aggregation of results per feature type\nad size user device user browser\n425x600 0.127 tablet android 1.147 safari65 1.132\n300x250 -0.086 xbox 0.970 safari75 1.065\n630x120 -0.149 tablet other 0.446 mob. safari 0.740\n300x100 -0.727 ps3 0.438 netfront 0.371\nhour PST iphone 0.433 ie6 0.352\n08h 0.131 mob. android 0.206 chrome4 0.318\n07h 0.046 mob. other -0.349 chrome11 0.312\n09h 0.024 desktop -0.675 realplayer 0.309\n22h -0.002 user os ?refox12 0.150\n20h -0.014 mac ppc 1.173 ie8 0.145\n21h -0.028 winphone7.5 0.854 ?refox3 0.144\nuser connection ps3gameos 0.362 safari5 0.137\noc3 1.226 win2k 0.254 chrome2 0.132\nsatellite 0.888 winxp 0.137 ie7 0.113\nmobile 0.826 winphone8 0.005 ?refox23 0.102\ndialup 0.227 os2 -0.030 ?refox11 0.090\nwireless 0.167 unix linux -0.062 chrome28 -0.007\nbroadband -0.156 win7 -0.174 chrome26 -0.046\ncable -0.433 win2k3 -0.247 safari85 0.080\nt1 -0.518 win8 -0.313 ie10 -0.117\nmac osx -0.435 ?refox21 -0.130\n?refox17 -0.180\nchrome27 -0.183\n2?3 we can detect and potentially eliminate 40% of late\nads.\nC. Of?ine ad-latency analysis results\nFor the of?ine ad latency analysis pipeline, we trained one\nlogistic regression model for each ad network. This choice\nwas made to better address any discovered issues.\nThe models for all R ad networks are trained in a single\nMapReduce job, where R models are trained on R reducers.\nThe mappers read close to a billion data points observed in\nthe latest 7 days. Ad network features are excluded from\nmodeling because they are redundant given the partitioning.\nModerate values of ?1 were used for 1 regularization.\nWe observed that this discards features with little support,\nfor instance operating systems, internet service providers,\nor browsers that very few people use, which is useful in\ninterpreting the results. Ultimately, advertisers will rarely\noptimize their ads for devices, or browsers that are not\ncommonly used.\nOnce the models are trained for a speci?c day, they can be\norganized by ad network in the form of high level features\n\(e.g. device, or browser to features with large positive and large negative\nweights, respectively. In addition, geographic \(geo features\ncould be displayed as a heat map. Table III shows a\nresulting visualization for some of the feature categories for\nan ad network. Most categories were omitted due to data\nsensitivity.\nThe analysis of type shown in Table III is very useful for\nall parties. Publisher can address the problematic web pages,\nadvertisers can revisit the design of certain creatives and\n?4\n?3\n?2\n?1\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nfe\nat\nur\ne \nwe\nig\nht\n \n \nISP\ncity\nspace ID\ncountry\ncreative ID\nstate\nbrowser\nos\nCS\ndevice\nhour\nad size\nad loc\ncolo\nFigure 2: Feature types sorted by logistic regression weights\noptimize them as needed, and the ad exchange can examine\nissues with speci?c servers, data centers or even ISPs.\nIf we sort the features by weights, as in Figure 2, we can\nfurther observe that ISP and geo features cover most of the\ntop and bottom positions. In the 100 features with highest\nweights, 75 are ISPs, 13 are geo, 6 are space IDs and 1 is\na creative. Of the 100 features with lowest weights, 62 are\nISPs, 21 are geo, 12 are space IDs, and 7. Interestingly, the\ntop negative position is held by a speci?c ad location on the\npage.\nOverall, the of?ine ad-latency analysis pipeline brings\nvalue to different players in the computational advertising\nbusiness. The hope is that over time, emerging ad serving\nand rendering problems can be detected early and resolved\nto some extent using the proposed method.\nV CONCLUSION\nIn this paper we show the results of a large scale ad\nlatency analysis. We described the methodology and high\nlevel implementation behind a system that collects and\nanalyses ad impression data. Using user, advertiser and\npublisher features, we trained models to predict ad latency\nvalues for runtime ad latency detection as well as for of?ine\nanalysis to help identify the features that are associated with\nlate ads. In future work, we will concentrate on regression,\nmodeling the interactions between the features by creating\ncross-features and develop an alternate modeling pipeline\nusing decision trees. We also plan to explore the idea of a\nPigovian tax [12], treating latency as a negative externality\nand penalizing an advertiser’s bid but allowing the ad to\nshow for a suf?ciently high cost.\nREFERENCES\n[1] J.

manufacturing configurations of the \nproducts from the ERP systems. After several iterative steps, \nthe results were approaching to a certain boundary value that \ncannot be further improved using static optimization methods.  \nFor this specific test case, the parameter variation was \nperformed for the total number of machine chains in a factory, \nthus the range of this particular parameter was varied between \ne.g. 3 and 6. Hence, each run of the algorithm determines a \nfixed number of so-called main process chains, which represent \nthe ideal machine configuration for this specific use-case. \nThe results of each run were then integrated through the \nintegrative information model served by the VPI Platform. \nThus, the different parameter configurations can be selected \nmodularly for different use-cases or optimization scenarios. \nThe results of each optimization run can consequently be \nvisualized continuously within a Web application, which was \ndeveloped for information management purposes. The use of \nthe web interface allows a user defined parameterization of the \ndifferent scenarios as shown in Figure 4. \nsawing turning grinding assemblingmilling drilling\nturning milling drilling\ngrinding assemblingmilling driling\nProduct 1\nProcess Chain\nProduct 2\n \n nFigure 4.  Web-App for the parametrized vizualisation of optimization results \nIn the figure a screenshot of the user interface for the layout \nplanning module of the factory planning application is shown. \nThe results for the process chain optimization algorithm that \nare visualized in the UI can be modified at each step of the \nplanning progress. The dependencies of these variations to \nother planning modules are consequently integrated in the \noverall planning process. The results for each specific \nparameter configuration can thus be utilized in all following \nplanning steps without further efforts. \nVI. CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK \nBased on a use case it was demonstrated that the use the \nVirtual Production Intelligence result in far reaching benefits in \nproduction planning. Due to the application of the VPI platform \nvarious constraints and parameters can be considered in the \nplanning. This enables an integrated, holistic view of various \nscenarios of the factory planning so that individual modules of \nthe production planning can be evaluated in the overall context \nof the planning process. Quantitatively reliable statements over \nthe planning success can thus be made at any time. \nIn the context of optimized production planning, the next steps \nwill consist especially in expanding the concepts presented in \nterms of a holistic interconnection of all levels involved in the \nproduction planning as well as in the manufacturing process. \nOn the methodological side, the presented concepts of the nvertical integration of production data have to be realized by \nextending the Virtual Production Intelligence Platform in terms \nof data flows from MES and the field level. These information \nneed to be processed and aggregated automatically so that they \nare available within the ERP systems and production planning. \nOnly through the interoperability between these systems an \nintegrated digital mapping of the production is possible. This \nprovides the basis for intelligent tools for the planning and \ndecision support in order to ensure a continuous improvement \nand further development of the production planning process. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT nThe present work is supported by the German Research \nFoundation \(Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft – DFG within \nthe Cluster of Excellence “Integrative production technology \nfor high-wage countries” at the RWTH Aachen University. \nREFERENCES \n[1] Menrath, M. \(2003 nWettbewerbsstrategie eines Unternehmens der Luftfahrtindustrie zur \nFertigungsstrategie des Standorts.

whether the design \nand staffing of polling places would allow everyone to exercise their right to vote with tolerable waiting. \nHistorical voting patterns including numbers of voters by precinct, actual voter turnout and the percent-\nage of the vote cast by time of day were available, as well as ballot-dependent models of the time to cast a \nvote. Simulations were constructed to assess poll performance for any given staffing level equipment ca-\npacity or registration policies.  \n Here are some reasons why reporting the results of stochastic simulation experiments is not easy: \n Simulations generate a lot of data: Even this simple example generates delay data for each of hun-\ndreds to thousands of voters; congestion data for the polling place, the registration desk and the voting \ndevices; and utilization data for poll workers and voting devices. A complex manufacturing or supply \nchain simulation could easily increase the amount of data by one to two orders of magnitude. The im-\nmense volume of data is one reason that simulation software invariably provides summary reports, typi-\ncally averaging everything in sight; but averaging introduces its own problems. \n Averaging through time masks time-dependent effects: A critical feature of voting is time-varying \nload. In some precincts voting primarily takes place before or after working hours; but a precinct serving \na retirement community will experience a very different distribution of load. The delay experienced by \nvoters, averaged throughout the voting day, will hide the long delays experienced by some voters during \npeak load periods by averaging them with brief delays for voters off-peak. While averaging across repli-\ncations is always statistically helpful, averaging within replications may be bad. \n The performance that interests us is often related to time: Recall our generic output da-\nta nyyy ,,, 21 … . These might be voter waiting times during the simulated day. To be very specific, in a \ntypical simulation these could be the waiting times of n  voters in the order that they completed waiting. \nNotice first that the index is not the order of arrival to the polling place, nor the order of departure from it. \nBut even if the output data were sorted in one of these two ways, it is unlikely that we are interested in, \nsay 32y , the waiting time of the 32\nnd voter of the day to arrive. Instead, the anticipated waiting time as a \nfunction of the time of arrival is what is relevant For instance, what delay might a voter expect who ar-\nrives at noon as opposed to 5 PM?  I am willing to argue that for nearly all systems with time-varying \nload, measures of delay should be indexed by time. But this a more subtle measure to define and estimate. \n A related problem is reporting results for continuous-time outputs, like queue length tQ . These out-\nputs are naturally indexed by time, so it is easy to generate a within-replication time plot of tQ  vs. t  as \nnearly all simulation languages do. Averaging such data across replications to get a better estimate of \nmean queue length as a function of time is certainly meaningful, but how do you do it? The most straight-\nforward way requires saving lots of data from each replication \(the values of itQ and it  at each point in \ntime it  when it changed amount of post-run computation. If a measure of varia-\nbility around this mean queue length is reported, as it should be, then there is even more work. Yet this is \nexactly the sort of information that would be meaningful in the voting model. \n Simulations are conducted in a sequential, exploratory manner: In classical design of experi-\nments, important factors are identified, levels of the factors are chosen, and all of these predefined exper-\niments are executed and the results analyzed. However, since simulations are not physical experiments ndata \(“runs to conduct some simulation studies in a more exploratory fashion. In the voting simulation we might \npick a particular layout and staff, make a few runs, look for problems, and adjust the staffing and capacity \nwhere we see congestion or idleness. How do we summarize a user-guided sequence of experiments on \ndifferent scenarios so as to insure that they did not miss something or get mislead? \n We focus on reporting error instead of risk: We have a historical focus on measures of error while \ndecisions should usually be based on measures of risk; even worse, users often confuse error with risk. A \nconfidence interval \(CI error; measures of error answer the question “have we done \n1278\nTaylor, Brailsford, Chick, L’Ecuyer, Macal and Nelson \n \nenough simulation to estimate whatever?” The answer should be related to the specific context like “I am \ncomfortable being off by ±$1000, but not ±$50,000.” The width of a CI says nothing about the natural \nsystem variability; that is, it says nothing about risk, although many people think that it does. A prediction \ninterval \(PI see when \nwe implement?” Measures of risk should be standard, but they are not. And when reporting either type of \nmeasure we should avoid statistically meaningless precision. See Nelson \(2008 2009 and Wieland and Nelson \(2009 and competing scenarios: It is a rare simulation that pro-\nduces only a single output measure, and for each output there may be more than one property we care \nabout. Trade-offs between costs, quality of service physical space, etc. are common. For some perfor-\nmance measures, the mean \(long-run average 


stability \(standard deviation, tail percen-\ntile, PI multiple scenarios or system designs. This is an \narea in which our reporting is particularly weak. Even the formal statistical comparisons we provide typi-\ncally focus on a single measure, and nearly always compare means rather than measures of risk.  \nThis list of analytics challenges is not exhaustive, but it is a good start. We are currently giving simulation \nusers amazing tools for generating data, but not nearly as much help in getting the most out of these data.  \n7 CONCLUSIONS \nThis paper has continued the discussion of Grand Challenges in M&S by discussing these from an Opera-\ntional Research/Management Science \(OR/MS It has discussed themes including simulation \nin healthcare, value of information, data modeling, stochastic modeling and optimization, agent-based \nsimulation and simulation analytics. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThe work described in C.

introduced SALSA, an approach to automatically\nanalyze Hadoop logs to construct state-machine views of the\nplatform’s execution [25]. The derived state-machines are used\nto trace the data-flow and control-flow executions. SALSA\ncomputes the histograms of the durations of each state and uses\nthese histograms to estimate the Probability Density Functions\n\(PDFs between the PDFs across machines to detect\nanomalies. Tan et al. also compare the duration of a state\nin a particular node with its past PDF to determine if the\nduration exceeds a determined threshold and can be flagged\nas an anomaly.\nAnother related work to this paper is the approach of Xu\net al. in [26], which uses the source code to understand the\nstructure of the logs. They create features based on the constant\nand variable parts of the log messages and apply the Principal\nComponent Analysis \(PCA behaviour.\nAll the above approaches are all designed for system\nadministrators in managing their large clusters. Our approach,\non the other hand, aims to assist developers in comparing the\ndeployed system on such large clusters against the develop-\nment cloud.\nX. CONCLUSION\nDevelopers of BDA Apps typically first develop their appli-\ncation with a small sample of data in a pseudo cloud, then\ndeploy the application in a large scale cloud environment.\nHowever, the larger data and more complex environments\nlead to unexpected executions of the underlying platform.\nSuch unexpected executions and their context cannot be easily\nuncovered by traditional approaches.\nIn this paper, we propose an approach to uncover the\ndifferent behaviour of the underlying platforms for BDA Apps\nbetween runs with small testing data and large real-life data\nin a cloud environment. To evaluate our approach, we perform\na case study on Hadoop, a widely used platform, with three\nBDA Apps. The case study results show the strength of our\napproach in two aspects:\n1 drastically reduces the verification effort\nby 86-97% when verifying the deployment of BDA\nApps in the cloud.\n2 the prob-\nlematic logs reported by our approach are much fewer\nthan using keyword search, which makes it possible to\nmanually explore the problematic logs.\nIn addition, our approach provides additional context informa-\ntion \(execution sequences sequences of the logs to\nrapidly understand the cause of problematic log lines.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
