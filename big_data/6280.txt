The Need of a Hybrid Storage Approach for IoT in PaaS Cloud Federation Maria Fazio Antonio Celesti Massimo Villari and Antonio Pulia\002to DICIEAMA University of Messina Contrada di Dio S Agata 98166 Messina Italy e-mail f mfazio,acelesti,mvillari,apulia\002to g unime.it Abstract Monitoring activities over many different types of sensors are very challenging to support advanced services for Internet of Things IoT and its future However one of the major issues is the explosion of the amount of heterogeneous information that has to be stored and processed thus causing the well known Big Data problem Some Cloud strategies have been investigated to offer IoT-oriented services but they do not speci\002cally address solutions for Big Data management In this paper we present a two-layer architecture based on a hybrid storage system able to support a Platform as a Service PaaS federated Cloud scenario The proposed architecture combines the bene\002ts of both storage approaches In particular it allows us on one hand to extend SQL-like legacy systems and on the other hand to manage Big Data through an XML-like non-SQL distributed storage system according to a Cloud federation approach Keywords cloud computing federation PaaS IoT Big Data monitoring sensor network I I NTRODUCTION Cloud computing represents a very 003exible technology that can ef\002ciently support Internet of Things IoT due to its ability in offering huge amount of resources and ef\002cient communication services for transferring 003ows of terabyte between data centers IoT enables seamless communication 003ows between heterogeneous devices hiding the complexity of the physical infrastructures and communication services However in such a scenario a huge amount of data 003ows across routers and computers and needs to be stored and processed Thus the research community is showing great interest in developing new Cloud platforms to integrate sensing activities in many application scenarios such as smart cities healthcare 3 homeland security 4 and so on Emerging Big Data solutions deal with storage strategies based on innovative NO-SQL database DB systems such as Sedna Cassandra Apache HBase MongoDB and so on Nevertheless most of the existing information systems are based on SQL-like DBs On one hand it is too hard imagining that existing providers would turn their SQL-like systems into NO-SQL ones in a short time On the other hand SQLlike DBs used for internal purposes by Cloud providers can yet ef\002ciently manage their local monitoring infrastructures Hence we think that legacy systems should be adapted and exploited according to new service models For these reasons in this paper we propose a two-layer hybrid architecture based on both SQL-like and NO-SQL XML-like technologies to provide a scalable ef\002cient and elastic sensing service New business opportunities also arise from federated environments where several Cloud providers join to share their resources Through federation they can offer theoretically unlimited sensing capabilities limiting costs for physical infrastructures Our solution decouples the local and the federated management of sensing resources Speci\002cally Cloud offers a Platform as a Service PaaS to store and access client data using a SQL-like DB At the same time they can share over the PaaS Cloud federation a portion of their data using a distributed NO-SQL XML-like storage system In this way the PaaS Cloud federation enables Cloud providers to collect and expose data coming from several heterogeneous sensing infrastructures with a good degree of ef\002ciency granularity and reliability In particular the proposed solution has been designed to address three main issues 1 how to build a data provisioning service across federated Clouds 2 how to store Big Data 3 how to provide heterogeneous sensing data to Cloud clients through seamless services The behavior of the whole system is based on a datacentric approach which allows to simplify asynchronous communications between monitoring environments and end-users To represents heterogeneous monitoring devices and data we refer the Sensor Web Enablement SWE speci\002cations de\002ned by the Open Geospatial Consortium SWE de\002nes data encodings and Web services to store and access sensorrelated data It is a widely adopted standard and has been also combined with new emerging standard such as the W3C Semantic Sensor Network ontology The paper is organized as follows In Section II we discuss related works Bene\002ts of Cloud federation in IoT are discussed in Section III Section IV introduces the Big Data problem in typical IoT scenarios The two-layer architecture enabling Big Data management in PaaS Cloud federation is discussed in Section V Conclusions and future works are summarized in Section VI II R ELATED W ORKS New Cloud systems interacting with sensors in IoT are recently appearing in literature In the authors highlight a

implementation shows all adopted solutions tailored for Smart Home scenarios a real use case deployed in Oulu Finnish city Another high level platform is reported in The presented framework is able to integrate Wireless Sensor Networks with Cloud Computing Cloud Computing is also becoming the basis for Big Data needs At the Infastructure as a Service IaaS level Big Data can leverage storage capabilities of Clouds as well as it can exploit computation power of virtual infrastructures Such an example is given in where Hadoop is instantiated into VMs and optimized for Big Data processing Another example of Big Data processing in the Cloud is presented in where the computation frame w ork called Sail\002sh is proposed to improve the disk performance for large scale MapReduce computations In the authors f ace up the Big Data problem in e-health scenarios looking at non-SQL DBs as key solution toward the full development of IoT and speci\002cally they investigate on how to shift towards the Web of Things The problem to 002nd an abstraction on sensing data representation was also identi\002ed from where authors analyzed the concepts of proximity adjacency or containment They even provided a global model with a dynamic interoperability disregarding how the global view should be accomplished Their decision-maker is able to process a huge amount of incoming data but it is not clear how such capabilities are practically addressed i.e scalability problems In it is presented an extension of the Ubiquitous Sensor Networks framework that leverage SWE along with the SIP protocol  Ho we v er  one of the main problems of the SIP protocol is related to network constrains Differently from 15 we think that v ery inno v ati v e and ef\002cient services can arise from the integration of many Cloud providers interested in gathering managing and processing monitored data coming from sensing devices in a federated environment III R ESOURCE M ANAGEMENT IN A C LOUD F EDERATION Federation is based on the concept that if a Cloud provider requires external resources it asks for them to other providers so that the resources belonging to a Cloud can logically be included in another Cloud This form of resource sharing aims to extend services and improve performance of each Cloud without conditioning its business According to the NIST formalization Cloud services are offered at three different service levels Software as a Service SaaS Platform as a Service PaaS and Infrastructure as a Service IaaS Cloud federation can be accomplished on each of these service level According to the nature of the federation resources can take different forms For example considering an IaaS federation a shared resource can be a Virtual Machine VM considering a PaaS federation a shared resource can be sensing data of a virtual sensor network in an IoT environment and considering a SaaS a shared resource can be an application accessible over the web Regarding the PaaS federation for IoT purposes sharing data means that Cloud providers are able to extend their services offering a more rich set of information since they can include data gathered from sensing environments managed by other providers In particular taking part in the federation implies share all or just a portion of sensing data Considering a scenario including different heterogeneous legacy systems each one using a SQL-like database a possible approach for the achievement of a PaaS Cloud federation consists in using a distributed XML-like NO-SQL distributed database on which each provider shares a total or partial view of the data stored in its local SQL-like database In this way a global XMLlike NO-SQL distributed database would enable the Cloud federation to address the Big Data problem Since each Cloud provider can manage heterogeneous sensing data the PaaS Cloud federation has to abstract and uniform data under a common global format In order to ful\002ll such a goal the Sensor Web Enablement SWE standard de\002ned by the Open Geospatial Consortium OGC is strate gic In fact the OGC-SWE framework speci\002cally faces sensing devices and enables web-based discovery exchanging and processing of sensor observations Services and encodings presented in the SWE methods are decoupled from any particular deployment scenario Within the SWE framework the development of a set of XML-like languages and Web service interface speci\002cations have been de\002ned In particular in the perspective of Cloud federation for IoT-oriented services information abstraction must be performed considering the following standards 017 O&M Observation and Measurements models and XML schema for encoding observations and measurements from a sensing environment 017 SensorML models and XML schemas for describing sensors systems and processes it provides the information required for sensor discovery sensor observations localization processing of low-level sensor observations and listing of taskable properties IV B IG D ATA IN I O T In order to explain why we refer to the Big Data problem when we discuss sensing activities in federated Cloud for IoT we discuss two typical IoT scenarios  i.e intrusion detection in smart cities and smart metering for power consumption management presenting the evolution of new smart devices for and analyzing the of data the y produce 017 Intrusion detection  Enforcing security is becoming crucial for all world-wide Governments Public Institutions and also private companies which are strongly working for implementing new solutions to improve what is commonly referred as Homeland Security HS Assessing and planning for risks can be done employing surveillance technologies in order to increase effectiveness in the response to future forthcoming and present risks Let assume that a City Council decides to install several surveillance cameras in strategic public targets to monitor suspicious activities For example we can consider a deployment of about 1000 cameras all around the city Common cameras are featured by RGB

sensors with a resolution of 640 x 480 pixels They might continuously record videos that will be stored in dedicated datacenters owned by the city government However cameras can optimize the necessary storage size recording their acquisition only whenever they detects movements According to in one yea r  1000 cameras need about 13,68PB of storage unit size 017 Smart metering  A recent survey sho ws that US public facility providers are strongly interested in adopting Smart Grids for smart management of the Electricity facility for several reasons reduction in restoration time analytics-based decision making reduction in peak demand increased visibility and control customer satisfaction in changing pattern based on end-users demand energy ef\002ciency and so on Similarly other type of public facilities e.g water gas network connection  can bene\002t a lot from smart metering systems These requirements impose a realtime analysis of data in short time ranges e.g 1-5 minutes Summarizing for each measurement we need roughly 4,200 bytes If we assume a sensing time interval of one minute over 50.000 buildings roughly estimate for a city with 200.000 citizens in one-year we need to store about 353,61TB of data The proposed analysis concerns only the smart meter for electricity facility If we extend the service to other facilities water gas network connection each building needs three/four Smart Meters and we the amount of data to store is about one or more PBs If we consider different cites each one acting as an independent Cloud provider and controlled by a central government we can easily understand how much sensitive is the Big Data problem V T WO L AYER A RCHITECTURE FOR B IG D ATA S TORAGE IN P AA S C LOUD F EDERATION In this Section we discuss a new solution for Big Data management in PaaS Cloud federation We assume that each Cloud exploit SQL-like DBs for internal management of data and services This assumption is very realistic considering the wide diffusion of SQL-like technologies Our solution allows providers to both bene\002t of SQL-like advantages in terms of 003exibility and to develop ef\002cient services without divesting their legacy systems In order to stimulate the cooperation among Clouds each provider stores all or a portion of data even in a Global XML-like non-SQL distributed storage system which is accessible from all the Clouds belonging to the federation As shown in Figure 1 such a strategy implies a two-layer hierarchy of storage Typically considering legacy systems each Cloud provider acting in IoT gathers data coming from several sensor networks and store them in its own local SQL-like DB This management is generally performed by a Database Agent DBAgent Clients can access data making speci\002c queries to the local SQL-like DB through the DBAgent SQL-like DB allows small/medium Cloud providers to manipulate data in an easy way and to bene\002t of high performance and 003exibility in information retrieval In our two-layer architecture the DBAgent is also responsible to store a total or partial view of gathered sensed data in a Global XML-like NO-SQL distributed database Global DB that is spread over all the federated Cloud providers Such a Global DB must be accessible from other Cloud providers and clients The Global DB needs to be highly scalable and to support an ef\002cient retrieval of data XPath and XQuery capabilities make the behavior of the Global DB SQL oriented This allows to easily retrieves information from the DB formatting data according to the XML-like semantic of the SensorML and O&M speci\002cation into the SWE standard According to federation agreements and Cloud policies for data management data are not roughly pushed on the Global DB but they can be 002ltered e.g at speci\002c time interval or geographical areas and/or manipulated e.g aggregated data differential values  before making them available according to speci\002c agreements among federated Cloud providers Such 002ltering and manipulation processes guarantee 003exibility in data management inside each Cloud provider and reduces the amount of data available in the federation Since the Global DB collects data coming from all the Cloud providers it has to be designed to store Big Data with NO-SQL solutions The proposed two-layer architecture improves the scalability of the data access service since it decouples intra-domain activities from the inter-domain ones The cost of a higher complexity of the architecture is balanced by its great 003exibility As shown in Figure 2 in order to enable the PaaS federation each Cloud system must include 002ve components a Middleware a Sensor Observation Service SOS Agent a local DB a Sensor Alert Service SAS Agent and a Web Service The DBAgent functionalities presented above are accomplished combining the features of these 002ve elements The Middleware can be whatever system adopted to administrate the Cloud provider The SOS Agent gathers sensing data from several sensor networks through a sync mechanism It implements the functionalities of the SWE-SOS which speci\002es both the XML-like language and interface for requesting 002ltering and retrieving observations and sensor system information It provides a way to integrate data from heterogeneous monitoring systems in a standard format accessible from Cloud providers by using a language and XML schemes for describing sensors systems and processes according to the SensorML standard and models and XML schema for encoding observations and measurements from a sensor network according the Observations and Measurements O&M standard According to the SWE standard the SOS Agent can be a software module independent from the legacy system It is responsible to store sensed data in the local SQL-like DB optionally and to forward sensed data for both event-based and on-demand interactions To make reliable and 003exible the services offered by the Cloud federation the two-layer architecute must enable clients to gather and deliver sensed data according to two approaches on-demand interaction and event-based interactions Figure 2

Fig 1 Hierarchical storage system for IoT in Cloud federation shows how these two types of interaction work according to the two-layer architecture The on-demand interaction allows clients to access sensed data when required typically by means of web service queries The event-based interaction is supported by the SAS Agent and provides sensed data to the client according to a publish-subscribe model Data can be classi\002ed in Subscription Offerings according to different features such as type of observation covered area monitoring device and so on Each type of Subscription Offering is identi\002ed through an Offering Identi\002er OfferingID  which univocally describe a speci\002c type of observation The main concept of OfferingID is introduced by the SWE speci\002cations and the management of such identi\002ers is out of the scope of this paper Using one or both the two approaches to access sensing data in the PaaS Cloud federation depends on the speci\002c use case On one hand the event-based interaction allows to gather near real-time data whenever a particular event occurs in the environment that is in the sensing infrastructure It can be useful for real-time added value services for example for land monitoring purposes On the other hand a Global DB distributed across all the federated Cloud providers allows to store huge amount of data for long time thus the ondemand interactions can be useful for tracking the history of a particular event or for statistical analysis We discuss client interactions in detail in the next sections The whole architecture also includes the Global DB and a Message Oriented Middleware MOM The MOM allows to interconnect federated Clouds building up a communication system based on message exchange Further details on MOM functionalities are discussed in the next sections A On-Demand Interaction In case of on-demand interaction the SOSAgent forwards sensed data to the middleware of the Cloud provider The middleware stores sensed information in the Global DB that is distributed across all the Cloud providers belonging to the federation As previously discussed the Global DB has to be based on an XML-like non-SQL distributed database To this regards possible solutions include Sedna Cassandra Apache HBase MongoDB and so on For this reason the queries must be accomplished by means of XPATH/XQUERY typically used to navigate and to retrieve data through elements and attributes in XML documents Clients can access these data using a web service e.g REST-based In particular users can query the Global DB using a web service software client interacting with a web service using the Application Program Interfaces APIs exposed by the Cloud provider B Event-Based Interaction In case of event-based interaction the SOS Agent forwards sensed data directly to the MOM using an Instant Massaging Protocol IMP e.g the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol XMPP No middleware pre-processing on data is necessary because the SWE compliant algorithms format observations as XML data and XMPP natively support XML This allows to reduce the overhead of the system The MOM is distributed across all the Cloud providers joining the federation In this way the sensed data coming from different Cloud providers can be shared with both clients and other Cloud providers Sensed data are delivered to clients by means

Fig 2 On-demand and event-based interactions of the SAS Agent according to a publish-subscribe model In particular a user subscribes an OfferingID and access data over the Multi User Chat MUC that is created for the speci\002c OfferingID  XMPP offers several bene\002ts to set up event-based interaction in a PaaS Cloud federation It is able to offer decentralization i.e no central master server should exist in a way similar to a p2p communication system for granting faulttolerance and scalability when new clients join the system 003exibility to maintain system interoperability security based on the use of channel encryption All these features are guaranteed in the current implementation by means of the employment of the Ejabberd XMPP server Ejabberd is an instant messaging server licensed under GPLv2 i.e free and open source written in Erlang/OTP Moreover Ejabberd is crossplatform fault-tolerant clusterable and modular Even though XMPP uses a client/server model there is not a central authoritative server As anyone may run its own XMPP server on its own domain it is the interconnection among these servers which makes up the XMPP network Each component on the network has a unique Jabber ID JID To avoid requiring a central server to maintain a list of IDs the JID is structured like an email address with a user name and a domain name for the server in which that user resides separated by an at sign  Cloud providers univocally de\002ned by JIDs make agreements and participate to the distributed management of the federation into assigned chat-rooms Moreover since XMPP can work on HTTP on TCP port 80 there is not problem for inter-domain communication even though Cloud providers are behind Network Address Translators NATs or 002rewalls VI C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORKS In this paper we presented a two-layer Cloud storage architecture for IoT purposes which aims to extend resource availability of each Cloud by means of a PaaS federation It offers data gathered from several heterogeneous monitoring infrastructures to IoT clients in a uniform way by exploiting data abstraction functionalities according to the SWE standard To address the Big Data problem the proposed architecture

allows to bene\002t of both SQL-like and non-SQL DB solutions It guarantees high stability and ef\002ciency proper of a SQLlike DB for the management of information inside a Cloud At the same time a distributed non-SQL DB gives world-wide extension to the system Moreover we discussed two possible types of interaction with Cloud clients i.e event-based and on-demand In future works we plain to

  7 4   R ESULTS AND D ISCUSSION  The power analysis of the MPSoC as generated by the XPower Analyzer tool from Xilinx is shown in figure 14 The estimation was carried out at an ambient temperature of 26 C  without air flow and no heat sink The estimated  maximum ambient temperature in atmospheric pressure was 78.8 C This is the estimated maximum temperature which might surround the FPGA during its operation and would not lead to exceeding the operating temperature limits. The commercial grade of the XCV 5LX50 has a recommended operating range of 0 to 85 C  The maximum die temperature is 125 C after that limit the FPGA would shut down automatically for protecting the die The estimated power consumption of the system is less than 1 Watt which is a good value for a design that contains 4 processor systems   Figure   14  XPower Analyzer estimation of the system power consumption  The temperature measurements of the sensors attached to the FPGA top surface, under the FPGA board and the target profile is shown in figure 15    Figure   15  Thermal vacuum test results for the XCV5LX50 MPSoC OBC  The sensors labels in figure 15 matches the positions labels in figure 8 and 9 The profile temperature indicates the temperature at the attachment point to the satellite structure which is also known as the mounting point This temp erature was controlled using a heater and a close loop control implemented in LABView The temperature of the FPGA top surface is almost identical for sensors 1 and 4 However sensor 1 showed slightly high values than sensor 4 as it located just on the cen ter of the FPGA The die is located in the center of the FPGA as well The die dimensions for the XCV5LX50 is 1.2mmx1.2mm The FPGA package is BGA of dimensions 27mm x 27mm Sensor 4 was located at the  top surface edge of the FPGA  The difference in tempe rature between sensor 1 and 4 is due to the heat propagation through the metal cap of the FPGA and the fact that sensor 1 is directly located above the die while sensor 4 is at the edge of the package The temperature under the FPGA showed lower values as it is 


  8 not touching the FPGA at all It is just located below the FPGA board in the space between the FPGA PCB and the base plate PCB The heater temperature measurement is shown in figure 16   Figure   1 6  Heater temperature during the tests  The shroud te mperature is shown in figure 17. The shroud top sensor showed slightly lower and stabilized readings than the shroud bottom sensor. Lower readings were due to the fact that the top sensor faces the entrance nozzle of the liquid nitrogen gas. The stabilizat ion in the sensor readings due to the heat dynamics as the liquid nitrogen propagates from top to bottom of the shroud and it is affected by the heat being emitted by the system and the heater   Figure   17  Shroud top and bottom surface temperatures  The supply of the liquid nitrogen was cut by the beginning of the high section of the second cycle. We cut the supply to save the liquid nitrogen as this part of the cycle is already in high temperature and liquid nitrogen would not affect the profile when we cut it. Therefore we decided to economize the consumption by cutting the liquid nitrogen at the beginning of the second cycle high section at the time marker \(28801\sec. Cutting the liquid nitrogen supply had the effect that the curves of the temperature sensors at the top and bottom of the shroud started to raise as shown in figure 17. Again this does not affect the profile as shown in figure 15. There is another advantage for cutting the liquid nitrogen supply at the last high cycle The temperature of t he shroud would start to raise and that would reduce the recovery time of the chamber as we can not open the chamber if its temperature is very low. typically we recover the pressure to the atmospheric pressure level and the temperature to 30  C  The syste m showed a robust operation and the curves obtained were clear and expressive The FPGA system worked flawlessly and all the interrupts were received adequately during the test time. A snapshot of the processors operation is shown in figure 18    Figure   18  Snapshot of the processors outputs  The design showed a robust performance and the operation of the test was maintained successfully The XCV5LX50 commercial grade withstood the thermal vacuum vibration test at the temperature profile set by the SMC standard   5   C ONCLUSION  In this paper we showed the thermal vacuum test setup procedure and results for an MPSoC OBC developed at Kyutech   The OBC was developed using the Virtex5 XCV5LX50 FPGA. The FPGA showed robust performance durin g the thermal vacuum tests. Although the FPGA was of a commercial grade it managed to operate at the  temperature profile from 24 C  to 60  C The FPGA temperature reached about 102 C This is a high temperature as the manufacturer recommends 85 C as a  maximum operating temperature. Thermal control should be used to attach the FPGA surface to a radiator such as heat sink or to maintain the temperature profile at the mounting point of the FPGA board to be lower than 60 C An  industrial grade FPGA might be another option as it has a wider operating temperature range from 45 C to 155 C The design that was tested shows the maximum utilization of the FPGA slices which gives a good indication about the maximum expected operating temperature of this class of FPGAs in the thermal vacuum environment of space We would repeat the tests to assess the durability of the system during long test cycles about 10 to 14 cycles Also we would use heat sink for thermal control of the FPGA  We recommend repeating the te sts on other FPGAs families and designs to enrich the literature with more data about the thermal perf ormance of COTS FPGAs in space

evidently clear that Big Data has come to stay. This is 
The Linear Search and Parallel Search however shows consistent result since the focus is on the entire specified data source. The false negative values are small and the true positive index is also high. An observation however is that, the false positive and false native results in the Linear Search also re-occur in the Parallel Search. This can be attributed to the fact that the Linear Search is the underlying methodology on which the Parallel Search is running In Table IV, the result from crawling some selected websites are shown. This websites are for health care providers. Using similar types of terms from the NoSQL, we perform similar searches on the Web. The accuracy index dropped because there were higher false positive and false values. This is more likely due to the fact that the web is wide with similar written terms but with different meanings. Since not all the keywords from the web are captured in the Dictionary/Thesaurus, most of the specified terms were mislabeled In Table V, we report the results from the search in the SQL database. The data here is a fraction of the NoSQL version. The results in the structured data source show very high accuracy in comparison to the rest of the data sources This is not because the proposed framework works better with structured data source but, because the data itself is very small in comparison to the rest. Further, we know where to find most of the terms we were looking for so narrowed our database choice in the case of the Pessimistic and Optimistic Search methodologies VI C ONCLUSION With the present direction of corporate transactions, it is because most traditional business transactions which use to be paper-based are all being digitized. Besides, user generated content across different spectrum of the enterprise landscape is increasing in volume at an exponential rate. While Big Data has its tremendous advantages, the fact that the data is heterogeneous \(i.e., variety\poses new challenges Previously, the data mining and knowledge discovery in database \(KDD\procedures were designed for schema-oriented databases. However, the data today is multifaceted and has no schema. Though the NoSQL databases have been proposed to accommodate the data, not many tools are available that performs data mining and analytics from such storages Our work details an Analytics-as-a Service \(AaaS\ tool that performs terms mining and analytics from multiple data sources. Currently, the following data sources are supported NoSQL \(e.g., document style storages such as CouchDB SQL, Tag/Flat file storage \(HTML, XML, RTF\, and Textual Documents \(e.g., PDF\ Furthermore, we conducted experiments using the various styles of storage such as NoSQL, Web, and SQL. The pilot testing shows an encouraging result especially from the NoSQL domain. Our future extension aims at incorporating learning and adaptability features. This will further facilitate the ability to do recommendations for users based on their term and topic mining requirements R EFERENCES  M R WI GA N A N D R   C L A R K E  B i g D a ta  s  B i g Uni nt e nd ed Consequences," Computer , vol.46, no.6, pp.46-53, June 2013, doi 10.1109/MC.2013.195 2
