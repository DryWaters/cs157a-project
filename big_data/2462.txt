This additional metadata may provide insight that can\nbe exploited for detection of anomalous events. In this paper, we\nuse a generalized linear model for random attributed graphs to\nmodel connection probabilities using vertex metadata. For a class\nof such models, we show that an approximation to the exact model\nyields an exploitable structure in the edge probabilities, allowing\nfor efficient scaling of a spectral framework for anomaly detection\nthrough analysis of graph residuals, and a fast and simple\nprocedure for estimating the model parameters. In simulation,\nwe demonstrate that taking into account both attributes and\ndynamics in this analysis has a much more significant impact\non the detection of an emerging anomaly than accounting for\neither dynamics or attributes alone. We also present an analysis\nof a large, dynamic citation graph, demonstrating that taking\nadditional document metadata into account emphasizes parts of\nthe graph that would not be considered significant otherwise.\nIndex Terms—Subgraph detection, network modularity, signal\ndetection theory, attributed graph modeling, generalized linear\nmodels\nI. INTRODUCTION\nIn numerous big data applications, relationships between\nentities are of interest. Connections between computers may\nbe analyzed for a computer security application [1], for\nexample, and large social networks are frequently analyzed\nto find communities and influential figures [2], [3]. In these\napplications, while the entities themselves may be of interest, it\nis their connections and relationships that provide real insight\nand situational awareness.\nWhen working with relational data, a graph is a natural\nmathematical structure for data representation.

Traditionally, graphs consist of only vertices\nand their connections, possibly with weights on the edges.\nIn many application domains, relational datasets also contain\ncontextual information on both edges and vertices. We receive\nraw collections not as a graph, but as a potentially multi-\nsource the data is not considered. If\nthese usually-ignored portions of the data are retained, they\ncan be useful for many purposes. In particular, these metadata\nprovide extra dimensions to the graph that can help determine\nwhich observed edges are likely to occur, and which are out of\nthe ordinary. This enables the uncued detection of anomalies in\nthe graph, which is the primary objective of many applications.\nIn earlier work, we developed a framework for uncued\nanomaly detection in large, dynamic graphs [4]. Detection\nof anomalous subgraphs is an important capability across a\nvariety of applications, such as detection of malicious software\nin a computer network, or the detection of threat actors in a\ncommunication network [5]. This framework treats a graph\nas an instance drawn from a distribution of random graphs,\nand performs spectral analysis of graph residuals \(i.e., the\ndifference between the observed graph and its expected value determine the presence of anomalies. This analysis uses a\ngiven expected degree model, which has a low-rank expected\nvalue structure, to facilitate efficient residuals analysis. The\nparameters of this model have a simple, closed-form estimator\nthat is approximately asymptotically unbiased, as shown in [6].\nThe residuals were analyzed over time, with a filter applied\nto emphasize certain behaviors. Steps toward optimizing such\nfilters were later presented in [7].\nIn this paper, we demonstrate a new technique for detection\nof anomalies in large, attributed graphs. Leveraging recent\nwork in subgraph detection, we show that this technique\nenables the detection of emergent activity that would not be\ndetectable in a static graph, or one without attributes. This\ntechnique is based on a generalized linear model \(GLM Since this model has some\nproperties that would make it intractable for real-time analysis\n978-1-4673-6213-9/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 179 ISI 2013, June 4-7, 2013, Seattle, Washington, USA\nof large datasets, we provide an approximation that enables\nfast parameter estimation and efficient analysis of attributed\ngraphs at large scales.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In\nSection II, we outline basic graph properties, and the attributes\nconsidered in our analysis. Section III presents the anomaly\ndetection problem model and our temporal integration tech-\nnique. In Section IV, we present the analysis of an efficient\nmethod for incorporating the GLM into the subgraph detection\nframework, which allows 


for an eigendecomposition of the\nresiduals matrix to be performed in linear time for a constant\nnumber of categorical attributes. Section V presents results\nof this technique in simulation, demonstrating the power of\nusing both dynamics and attributes in the analysis of graph\nresiduals, and in Section VI we present findings when this\ntechnique is applied to a large document corpus. In Section\nVII, we summarize and outline future research directions.\nII. GRAPHS AND ATTRIBUTES\nAs mentioned previously, a graph is a pair of sets G n\(V,E the two\nvertices are connected with no notion of ordering. In the\nformer case, E ? V ×V , where ordering denotes the direction,\nwhereas in the latter case E consists of 2-vertex subsets\nof V . For the purpose of this paper, we will consider only\nunweighted graphs, though the analysis can be extended to\ngraphs with weights. For convenience, let N = |V | and\nM = |E|. An important notion in our analysis is that of\nvertex degree. The degree of a vertex is the number of other\nvertices with which it shares an edge, i.e., the degree of v ? V\nis |{u|{u, v} ? E}| for undirected graphs, and in a directed\nsetting, v has in- and out-degrees of u|\(u, v v, u ? E}|, respectively.\nIn our detection framework, we make use of matrix repre-\nsentations of a graph. The adjacency matrix A of the graph is\na matrix in which the entry in row i and column j is nonzero\nonly if there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j. \(This requires\nan arbitrary labeling of the vertices with integers from 1 to N weighted graph, or 1 for an unweighted graph. Also, if the\ngraph is undirected, the adjacency matrix will be symmetric.\nFinally, let k ? ZN denote the vector of observed degrees,\nwith the ith component ki being the degree of vertex i. For\ndirected graphs, there will be two vectors, kin and kout, for in-\nand out-degrees.\nWe will consider graph attributes that can be divided into\nthe following cases:\n• Vertex attributes: properties of the entities, which may be\nreal-valued or categorical;\n• Edge attributes: properties of the relationships which\nmay be real-valued or categorical;\n• Vertex pair attributes: regardless of the presence of an\nedge, an attribute regarding a pair of vertices.\nWithin this context, edge attributes are typically part of the\nobserved relationships, e.g., duration of a connection in a com-\nputer network or amount of money transferred in a financial\ngraph. Thus, real-valued attributes can be expressed as edge\nweights, and categorical attributes can be encoded through the\nuse of multi-graphs, i.e., graphs with multiple edges allowed\nbetween one pair of vertices, in this case denoting different\nkinds of relationships.\nWith this in mind, we will limit the scope of attributes\nwe consider to those related to vertices and pairs of ver-\ntices That is, the attributes of interest will be those that\nmanifest themselves as parameters to the model intrinsic\nvertex properties observed relationships purpose of the approximation\nintroduced in Section IV, we will also only consider vertex\npair attributes that are categorical. While this ignores some\npotentially interesting behavior—such as cases where past\nobservations impact the probability of future ones—it enables\na convenient, exploitable model that enables efficient residuals\nanalysis in a broad space of random graphs.\nIII. PROBLEM MODEL\nWe pose the subgraph detection problem as one of tradi-\ntional signal detection theory, as first discussed in [8 The\nobjective, given an observed graph over time, G\(n test:{\nH0 : The observed graph is “noise” GB\nH1 : The observed graph is “signal+noise” GB ?GS .\nHere, GB V,E VS , ES NS =\n|VS |  N that is embedded into the background. This\nsubgraph will be unlikely to occur under the background\ndistribution, and, therefore, is an anomaly and will serve as\nthe signal. Only cases where the subgraph is embedded on\nvertices already existing in the background, i.e., VS ? V and\nGB ?GS = \(V,E ? ES considered.\nThe present work is focused on graphs with attributes on\nthe vertices, and between pairs of vertices. For this purpose,\nwe will assume that the metadata are not affected by the\nembedding procedure. That is, when embedding a subgraph\ninto a background graph GB , which has fixed attributes,\nthe vertices of selected to comprise GS will maintain their\nattribute values, and only the topology will change.\nWe resolve the hypothesis test through analysis of graph\nresiduals. Filter coefficients h are given to integrate the resid-\nuals over a time window. An approximation of E[A\(n consider\nthe eigendecomposition of the integrated residuals matrix,\nU?UT =\nL?1?\n`=0\nh` \(A\(n n  dimensionality\nof the problem, and efficiently determine the presence of an\nanomalous subgraph.\n180\nAs in [7 we will consider a known signal model, where\nthe subgraph behavior of interest is known, but its position\nwithin the background is not. To compute these coefficients,\na 3-way tensor of the subgraph adjacency matrix AS\(n a rank-1 approximation\nfor the tensor is computed, as described in [9]. The factor of\nthis approximation along 


the temporal dimension is used for\nthe filter coefficients. As noted in [7], this will maximize the\nspectral norm of the integrated subgraph\nL?1?\n`=0\nAS\(n resid-\nuals matrix. In the subsequent sections, we will demonstrate\nthat, while temporal integration provides a significant benefit\nin terms of subgraph detection ability, knowledge of vertex\nattributes allows for detection of much subtler anomalies.\nIV. RESIDUALS ANALYSIS IN ATTRIBUTED GRAPHS\nTo model a random graph without edge weights, each\npossible edge will be modeled as a Bernoulli random variable.\nLet the probability of an edge occurring between vertices i and\nj be pij . For an attributed graph, we use a logistic regression\nmodel based on vertex and edge attributes. Let ?i be a vector\nof real-valued attributes for vertex i, and ?ij be the attributes\nof vertex pair \(i, j principle as linear regression to map a\nlinear combination of attributes to edge probabilities, i.e.,\npij n1\n1 + exp\n\(\n?xTout?i ? xTin?j ? xTpair?ij\n 1 source ver-\ntices, destination vertices, and pairs of vertices, respectively.\nNote that, for undirected graphs, xout = xin. This sort of model\nhas been used in link prediction [10], to quantify the impact\nof attributes on whether or not an edge occurs.\nWhile this generalized linear model allows a direct mapping\nof attributes to probabilities, this comes at the expense of a\nrelatively expensive fitting procedure. A maximum likelihood\ntechnique can be used to estimate the coefficients in xin, xout\nand xpair, but this algorithm will cost O\(N2 graphs, which are typically sparse, it is beneficial\nto have an exploitable structure in the expected value matrix\nthat enables fast calculation of residuals without storing a\nlarge, dense matrix. For example, when using Newman’s\nmodularity matrix, as described in [11], the residuals matrix is\nthe sum of a sparse matrix and a rank-1 matrix, which allows\nefficient computation of eigenvalues. No such exploitable\nstructure exists for the GLM, meaning that the residuals matrix\nmay be a dense matrix with no special structure, which will\nrequire O\(N2 log-linear model rather than a logistic-linear model for edge\nprobabilities. That is, we allow the approximation\npij ? exp\n\(\nxTout?i + x\nT\nin?j + x\nT\npair?ij\n 1 + e?x The log-linear\nmodel is frequently used as a generalized linear model when\na distribution can have an arbitrary positive expected value,\nsuch as a Poisson distribution. For small expected values, a\nPoisson distribution approaches a Bernoulli distribution, so\nthis model is a good approximation for sparse graphs where\nany individual edge is fairly unlikely. As we demonstrate in\nthe remainder of this section, this approximation has properties\nthat can be exploited for computational efficiency.\nIn the case of categorical vertex pair attributes, i.e., cases in\nwhich the vertex pair attributes are dependent on the categories\nof the associated vertices, the rank of the expected value matrix\nwill be equal to the number of categories. Let C be the number\nof categories, Ic be the indices of vertices in category c, and\nI\(i in the same category as\nvertex i. The probability matrix P = {pij} has the form\nP = diag \(?out in 2 entries being 0.\nThe position of the nonzero entry corresponds to the category\nof the vertex, i.e., if vertex i is in category c, the ith row of\n? will have a 1 only in column c. The matrix X = {xij}\nconsists of the terms from \(1 the\nvectors ?out and ?in are defined such that ?out\(i i rank C.\nThe relatively low rank of the probability matrix allows for\nfast computation of the principal eigenvectors of A ? P . As\ndiscussed in [4], matrix-vector multiplications are at the heart\nof algorithms for computing extreme eigenvectors and eigen-\nvalues of matrices. With a probability matrix in the form of 2 the running time\nwill scale tractably for large graphs. To compute the product\n\(A?P z ? RN , we first compute Az,\nwhich is a sparse matrix-vector multiplication taking O\(M requires two entry-wise scalings \(by ?in\nand ?out, O\(N matrices \(also O\(N O\(C2 Az, costing\nO\(N M+N+C2 the implicitly-\nrestarted Lanczos algorithm to compute m eigenvectors of the\nresiduals matrix, the matrix-vector multiplication running time\nimplies a total time complexity of O\(\(M+C2 where the number of restarts depends on the\nrelative distance between consecutive eigenvalues. Thus to\ncompute a fixed number of eigenvectors, if the number of\ncategories remains fixed, the per-iteration cost of the algorithm\nwill scale linearly in the number of edges.\nIn addition to efficient computation of the eigenspace, this\nmodel enables a fast parameter approximation scheme based\n181\non moment matching. Consider 


the sum over the entries of\nthe observed adjacency matrix corresponding to edges going\nfrom category a to category b. In expectation, we have\nE\n???\ni?Ia\n?\nj?Ib\naij\n?? = ?\ni?Ia\n?\nj?Ib\n?out\(i j out\(Ia Ib N?\nj=1\n?out\(i j i j i Ic i by\n?in\(i Ic i category\nhas unit L1 norm, we can estimate the probability matrix by\nletting the estimate of X be a matrix of the observed volumes\nof the portions of the graph corresponding to different\ncategory pairs, i.e., X? = ?TA and the estimates of ?in and\n?out be the observed in- and out-degree vectors, normalized\nin each category block to have an L1 norm of 1. Thus, we\nhave estimates\n??in\(i i i j i nkout\(i i j probability matrices of the form \(2 computed\nwith block-normalized vectors using a new X matrix, X˜ =\n{x˜ij}, such that\nx˜ij xij??out\(Ii Ij matrix of [11], it creates a residuals matrix\nwhere the vector of all 1s, denoted 1, is in the nullspace.\nMultiplying the adjacency matrix on the right by 1, we get the\nvector of out degrees.

Thus, any eigenvectors \(for undirected graphs for directed principal\nsingular vectors will be centered at the origin.\nV. SIMULATION RESULTS\nTo demonstrate the impact of this additional information\non subgraph detection, a Monte Carlo simulation was run,\ngenerating dynamic random graphs from a model based on\n\(2 each category. The ? vector is created\naccording to a power law, since many large, real-world graphs\nhave powerlaw distributions. The categorical parameters create\na homophily effect, causing higher probability of connectivity\nbetween vertices in the same category, similarly to the model\nfor interaction rates proposed in 12]. In particular, we use\nX =\n24 10000 3500 40003500 10200 3100\n4000 3100 9900\n35 ,\nmaking connection within a category about 2.5–3 times as\nlikely as between categories. The ? vector was block-unit-\nnormalized, so the values in X correspond to the expected\nvolumes within the corresponding parts of the graph.\nTo incorporate dynamics, we generate 8 samples from this\ndistribution independently. This is used for the H0 case. For\nthe H1 case, 5 vertices are chosen uniformly at random\nfrom each category, and these 15 vertices comprise the signal\nsubgraph. The signal starts with no edges, then adds edges at\na constant rate over the course of the first 7 time steps, until it\nreaches a prescribed density. At the last time step, edges are\nremoved, so that the subgraph has only 30% of the edges it\nhad in the previous sample. This could represent an increase in\ncommunication leading up to an event, followed by dispersion\nto avoid detection. The filter coefficients are optimized using\nthe Matlab Tensor Toolbox1. After integration according to\nthis filter, a chi-squared test for independence is performed in\nthe principal 2-dimensional subspace, as described in [8]. The\nresult of this test is used as our detection statistic.\nFour separate scenarios were run. In one case, neither\ndynamics nor attributes were considered. In this scenario, we\ntake the graph at time step n = 7, i.e., the point in time\nwhere the subgraph is the densest. The residuals matrix used\nis the modularity matrix of [11], i.e., A kkT not attributes, estimating k without\nconsidering categories, and integrating \(A\(n kkT given filter coefficients. Third, we consider attributes,\nbut not dynamics. Again, only time step n = 7 is used, but\nP is estimated using the method described in Section IV.\nFinally, we use both dynamics and attributes. In this case,\nP is estimated using measurements at all time steps, and we\nintegrate the residuals over time using the filter.\nDetection performance in a 2000-trial simulation is pre-\nsented in Figure 1. When neither dynamics nor attributes\nare considered \(top left performance is fairly mediocre.

DATA ANALYSIS\nUsing the commercially available Thomson Reuters Web of\nScience R© \(WoS  dynamic\ngraph based on document citations. This dataset is comprised\nof records, compiled for research purposes, representing schol-\narly publications of the international scientific community,\npublished between 1900 and present in public commercial\nand open source journals and conference proceedings. Each\nrecord represents an individual document, and fields include\ndocument title and type, journal name, author names and\ninstitutional affiliations \(as provided in publication citation graph, each vertex represents a document,\nwith a directed edge going from vertex i to vertex j if\ndocument i cites document j. We consider a citation graph for\neach year, since this is the most reliable time resolution. For\neach year, we fit the model in \(2 outlined in Section IV, with the vertex\ncategory determined by the “subject” field in the database.\nOver the years from 1937 to 1986, the yearly graph increases\nfrom about 1500 documents and 80,000 citations per year to\nnearly 500,000 documents and 7.8 million citations per year.\nAt each year, after fitting the graph to the model, we integrate\nthe residuals over a 6-year window, using a linear ramp filter to\nemphasize emergent behavior. The top 30 singular values are\ncomputed, which are shown in the lefthand plot in Figure 2.\nIn 1976 there is a substantial uptick in several of the singular\nvalues, so we will investigate this period of time in detail.\nLooking at the window from 1971 to 1976, the second and\nthird right singular vectors \(corresponding to cited documents The first singular vector is dominated by a single, high-degree\nvertex, seen in the lower left in the plot toward the top of the plot all correspond to analytical\nchemistry papers written in the 1950s and ’60s 14]–[18], all\nof which have accumulated thousands of citations over the\nyears.

The 5 outliers are cited\nby documents from between 63 and 76 of the 290 different\nsubject labels over the 6 years, while other analytical chemistry\npapers with even higher degree were cited by documents from\n47 to 55 different subjects over the same period. Without\nconsidering document subjects, these 5 documents are buried\nin the background noise, but their substantial cross-subject\ncitation brings them into the front of the residuals space,\ndemonstrating the power of this approach.\nVII. SUMMARY\nIn this paper, we describe a simple model for incorpo-\nrating vertex attributes into spectral analysis of dynamic\ngraph residuals. An approximation to the logistic regression\nmodel enables both efficient computation of residuals and\nsimple fitting of model parameters Simulations demonstrate\nthe benefit to detection performance of taking both dynamics\nand vertex attributes into consideration, and an analysis of a\ndynamic citation network shows that accounting for attribute\ninformation emphasizes portions of the graph that would not\nbe strong otherwise. It is clear that using vertex metadata is\na powerful technique for subgraph detection, and future work\nwill focus on extending the approximation used here to an\neven broader class of models, analyzing the statistics of the\nsuggested 


estimator, and determining detectability when the\nobservations are corrupted or obfuscated.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors wish to thank J. Kepner and M. S.

It is also illustrative of the attention\neconomy, the growth and diminution of audiences and the\nchurn in platforms as site populations develop, change and, in\ncertain cases, falter.

This means that\nthe window of opportunity to complete any such research is\nin all probability limited, and that the reproducibility of that\nactivity is limited.\nAnalyzing the big-data collected across all these social\nmedias produces category/ies within which each data item\nthat can be classi?ed with connections in the knowledge\nstructure related concepts. Looking at these knowledge\nstructures and the structural relationship between the existing\nconcepts, the context domain creates an ‘ontology’ [25].\nHowever, the role of social networks in concept classi?cation\nhas shown that variations are weakly visible in the data\nwhen evaluating terminology taken from social websites.\nAlso reaching an agreement about the actual ontological\nrelationships can take many rounds of iterations [26].\nVI. CONCLUSION\nLooking at multiple social networks, we have collected\nlarge amounts of data for the purpose of data analysis. We\nmay choose to evaluate this data either from a philosophical\nor statistical perspective, or through combination of the\nidenti?ed approaches. Therefore we have chosen to use\na Bayesian statistical reasoning technique to evaluate the\nprobability of occurrence and reasoning behind participation\nor staging, for these ?ash events.\nWe conclude that social network-based data collection is\na useful approach for the analysis of ‘long-tail’ phenomena\nwhere the distribution of many values are far from the mean.\nWhilst a longitudinal study would be of bene?t if achievable,\nwe concede that practical limitations will in many cases limit\nresearchers to post-hoc studies. In this instance we suggest\nthat a retrospective cross-sectional approach can usefully be\nsupplemented with additional social data sources in order to\nlimit the impact of noise and to mitigate the effect of small\nsample sizes.\n458\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank Gregory J.

This is because the \ntime in preparation may be very low while the time in space \nmay be very long. If the preparation period will be less than \nseveral weeks then sampling frequency should be ncontinuous or as continuous as feasible . If the preparation \nperiod for launch will occur over many weeks then the \nsampling frequency can be reduced to once/hour. \nIn general, the shorter the preparation time for launch the \nhigher the data sampling frequency is required. Preferably, \nprelaunch activity biological diagnostic data should be \nrecorded continuously and the data available for merging \nwith launch and on-orbit data. After a person initially \narrives in space, the sampling frequency should be \ncontinuous or near continuous . After the person has been in \nspace for several weeks, the sampling frequency can be \nreduced to once/hour. If a person is in space for several \nmonths, the sampling frequency can be reduced to as little \nas once/6 hours . \nTable 2.

CONCLUSION \nA prognostic and health management \(PHM industry telemetry to collect, store and distribute \nto remote locations the biological, diagnostic information \nfor process for predicting mental illness using with \npredictive algorithms .  The predictive algorithms are often \nproprietary and must be developed for use with aerospace \ntelemetry to compensate for the many shortcomings and \ncomplexities of CCSDS telemetry to be accurate and \nreliable. Our proprietary predictive algorithms were \npioneered on the Air Force's GPS satellites and Atlas launch \nvehicles over 30 years ago. They have also been \nsuccessfully used on other military, NASA and commercial \nsatellites, launch vehicles and missiles to illustrate the \npresence of accelerated aging in normal appearing \nequipment telemetry from completely normal behaving \nequipment. \nA behavior of a person ' s  FOFR can explain the cause ntreatment and the cure for mental illness .  The chemicals \n1 8  \nreleased by the FOFR when activated were developed by the \nFOFR to be in the body an extremely short duration. \nToday's  lifestyle has forced people to remain in threatening \nsituations forcing the presence of the toxic chemicals used \nby the FOFR for self preservation to be present for many \nyears at varying levels. The chemicals released by the FOFR \nand release of chemicals that are created as a result of the \nrelease of adrenaline and cortisol cause accelerated aging on \nthe entire body including all areas of the brain. When the \nFOFR is damaged from accelerated aging, it forces the \nbrain 's  chemistry to be altered by changing the ratios of \nthree main chemicals very, causing mental illness .  All the \nmedications used in mental health treat only the symptoms \nof mental illness and do not cure it. \nThe identification of accelerated aging in biological, \ndiagnostic telemetry can be used by ground personnel to \npredict the mental illness in personnel to be used for deep \nspace missions. The model of the brain' s  FOFR subsystem \nprovides the information necessary for the ground crew to \npredict and thus prevent mental illness from occurring by \nmaking the changes to the person ' s  environment. The PHM \nuses information obtained from a variety of mission phases \nincluding pre-launch readiness, launch and during deep nspace travel to develop baseline behavior from which \nmental illness can predicted so it can be prevented nREFERENCES \n[ 1 ] .

specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
