This kind of information is quite useful for the telecom service provider to provide the appropriate services to their customers for effective churn management  1. Introduction  In telecommunications industry, which changed from a rapidly growing market into a fierce competition and saturated market, suffers a critical issue of the customers who are easily to change a telecom service provider to another ones. For telecommunications industry, however, acquiring a new customer will pay much higher costs than retaining an existing one, and thus, decreasing the churn rate has become more and more important. The goal of churn management is not only to discover the customers who might be lost but also provide them the correct services they want. Thus to effective churn management, a useful technique for finding the telecom services which the customers really want is needed In all data mining techniques, mining association rules is often defined as finding the itemsets which frequently occur together in a given dataset [1, 2, 10 12 T h e g e n e ral  f o rm o f  an  as s o ci ati o n r u l e is   B A 000  where A and B are two itemsets, and 002  B A 000\024 A wide application of mining association rules is to identify the customersê behaviors in various business databases For example, in telecommunications industry, mining association rules can help us to extract the sets of the telecom services which are frequently used by the same customers in the telecom database. Clearly, this kind of information is useful for understanding the popular sets of the telecom services which they provide for their customers. However, two services which are frequently used by the same customers can not always imply that there exists a strong relationship between them. For example, assume that a telecom service S  is popular and used almost by all customers, then the service S is very likely used with other services frequently by the some customers, but in fact, the relationships between this service and other services may be not strong. Thus mining association rules may generate some misleading information for a telecom service provider to provide appropriate services to their customers. In this case mining the correlation rules may be a good way to find the telecom services which the customers really want Mining correlation rules is a procedure of finding the itemsets which are highly related to each other from a given dataset [4, 10, 12  Ho w e ve r  in p r a c t i c a l  telecom databases, data are not only described by binary values but also are described by quantitative ones, such as the number of times that a customer used in a period time, waiting to be explored, therefore methods for discovering the correlation rules from these quantitative data are also needed. For avoiding the shape boundary problem, the concept of fuzzy set theory [17 i s co m m o n l y u s ed i n  th i s cas e t o t r an s f o r m  these quantitative data into the fuzzy items or the fuzzy attributes, and this kind of fuzzy rule is called the fuzzy correlation rule To discover the services which the customers really want, we propose an algorithm for mining the target

oriented fuzzy correlation rules to focus on finding the strong correlations between the most popular service and other services according to the numbers of times that the customers used. Our work can help the telecom service provider to retain the telecom services highly related to the most popular service. In this paper, we show how, by using the fuzzy statistics analysis, the target-oriented fuzzy correlation rules can be obtained from the given database. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Some basic concepts involved in mining the fuzzy correlation rules are introduced in section 2. The proposed algorithm for mining the target-oriented fuzzy correlation rules is presented in section 3. An experiment is displayed in section 4. The conclusions are given in section 5  2. Preliminaries  Some basic concepts involved in mining the fuzzy correlation rules are introduced in this section  2.1. Fuzzy association rule  Mining fuzzy association rules is the task of finding the fuzzy itemsets which frequently occur together from the given database [3, 5, 7-14   Let      2 1 m f f f F 000\026  be a set of fuzzy items  T       2 1 n t t t 000\026 be a set of fuzzy records, and each fuzzy record i t is represented as a vector with m values      2 1 i i t f t f     i m t f 000\026 where   i j t f is the degree that fuzzy item j f appears in record 003    i j i t f t   1  0   Then, a fuzzy association rule is defined as an implication form, such as 000 A F  B F where F F F B A 004   are two fuzzy itemsets, and  B b b all A a a all F f F f 003 005 006 003 005 A fuzzy association rule B A F F 000 holds in T with the fuzzy support    B A F F fsupp and with the fuzzy confidence   B A F F fconf 000 9 The fuzzy support and the fuzzy confidence of the fuzzy association rule B A F F 000 are defined as follows n F F f t f F F fsupp B A j i j n i B A        min    1 003  000  1        A B A B A F fsupp F F fsupp F F fconf  000 2 If the    B A F F fsupp is greater than or equal to the predefined threshold, minimal fuzzy support, and the   B A F F fconf 000 is also greater than or equal to the predefined threshold, minimal fuzzy confidence, and then the fuzzy association rule 000 A F  B F is considered an interesting fuzzy association rule  2.2. Fuzzy correlation rule  While the task of mining fuzzy association rules concerns the co-occurrence of the fuzzy itemsets, the task of mining fuzzy correlation rules focuses on the correlation relationships among the fuzzy itemsets. In previous researches [15, 16  w e h a v e p r es en t e d an  algorithm to discover fuzzy correlation rules by using the fuzzy simple correlation analysis [6 Assume that      2 1 m f f f F 000\026  is a set of fuzzy items      2 1 n t t t T 000\026  is a fuzzy dataset with n records, and each record i t is represented as a vector with m values         2 1 i m i i t f t f t f 000\026 where   i j t f is the degree that fuzzy item j f occurs in record  1  0     003 i j i t f t Then the form of a fuzzy correlation rule is  B A F F 007 where B A F F   F 004 are two fuzzy itemsets, and 006 003 005 A a a all F f   B b b all F f 003 005 A fuzzy correlation rule B A F F 007 holds in T with the fuzzy support    B A F F fsupp and with the fuzzy confidence   B A F F fconf 007 and with the fuzzy simple correlation coefficient   B A r  The fuzzy support and the fuzzy confidence of  B A F F 007 are the same as of a fuzzy association rule The fuzzy simple correlation coefficient of B A F F 007 is defined as follows B A B A B A s s s r 010    3 where 1         1   000  010    n t t s n i B i B A i A B A     4      min   A j i j i A F f t f t 003   5      min   B j i j i B F f t f t 003   6   A A F fsupp   7   B B F fsupp   8 2 A A S s  9 2 B B S s  10 1     1 2 2    000  n t S n i A i A A   11

Target-oriented fuzzy correlation rules  To discover the strong correlations between a popular telecom service and other telecom services according to the numbers of times that the customers used, we propose an algorithm for mining the targetoriented fuzzy correlation rules. A target-oriented fuzzy correlation rule is a fuzzy correlation rule with a fuzzy item we specify. In this section, we show how, by using the fuzzy statistics analysis, the target-oriented fuzzy correlation rules can be obtained  from a given database Assume that      2 1 m f f f F 000\026  be a set of fuzzy items and t F is the target fuzzy item of F       2 1 n t t t T 000\026   be a fuzzy dataset with n records, and each sample record i t is represented as a vector with m values         2 1 i m i i t f t f t f 000\026 where   i j t f is the degree of the fuzzy item j f belongs to record i t    i j t f  003  1  0   Before staring the algorithm, three user-predefined thresholds     f f f r c s need to be determined, where f s  is the minimal fuzzy support f c is the minimal fuzzy confidence f r is the minimal fuzzy simple correlation coefficient. The details of the algorithm are described as follows Step 1: For each fuzzy item F f j 003 the value of   j f S is computed n t f f S n i i j j 000   1     13 Step 2: Let 1 L be the set of the fuzzy items whose value of   j f S is greater than or equal to f s  T F is the fuzzy item with the largest value of   j f S  Step 3: Let T F L L   1  1  Step 4: Let 2 C be the set of the combinations of  1 L  joint with  T F        1 2 L F F F C A T A 003   Step 5: For each member of  2 C say    T A F F the value of the fuzzy support    T A F F fsupp  and the value of the fuzzy simple correlation coefficient   t A r are computed respectively by formula \(1\and by formula \(3 Step 6: Let 2 L is the set of the members of 2 C whose fuzzy supports are greater than or equal to f s and fuzzy simple correlation coefficients are greater than or equal to  f r  Step 7: Let  2 C be the set of the combinations of  1 L  joint with   1 L         1  2 L F F F F C C B C B 003    C B F F 006  Step 8: For each member of   2 C say    C B F F the value of the fuzzy support    C B F F fsupp  and the value of the fuzzy simple correlation coefficient   C B r are computed respectively by formula \(1\d by formula \(3\as well Step 9: Let  2 L is the set of the members of  2 C whose fuzzy supports are greater than or equal to f s and fuzzy simple correlation coefficients are greater than or equal to  f r  Step 10: Generate each  3  011 k C k by  1 L joint with  1  k L Assume that D F is a member of  1 L     F E F F is a member of  1  k L the size of E F  is  e If    D E F F is a member of 1  k L or  1  k L  then the combination     F D E F F F is a member of k C Similarly, if    D F F F is a member of e k L  or   e k L  then the combination      D F E F F F is also a member of k C  Step 11: For each member of  k C say    G F F F the value of the fuzzy support    G F F F fsupp  and the value of the fuzzy simple correlation coefficient   G F r are computed respectively by formula \(1\d by formula \(3 Step 12: Let k L is the set of the members of k C  whose fuzzy supports are greater than or equal to f s and fuzzy simple correlation coefficients are greater than or equal to  f r  Step 13: Generate each  3   011 k C k by  1  k L joint with

Experiment  A simple dataset sampling from a real telecom database is shown in Table 1. Each entry ij t of Table 1 is the number of times per month that the customer Cid i  used the telecom service S j averaged over eight months Before starting the procedure of mining the targetoriented fuzzy correlation rules from this dataset, the thresholds need to be determined in advance. Here f s  is set to 0.25 f c is set to 0.80 f r is set to 0.30.  First we use the formula \(14\ to determine the degrees of interesting to the telecom services for each customer and transform the Table 1 into Table 2. Therefore, each entry ij t of the Table 2 is the degree of interesting that the customer Cid i  used the telecom service S j  000 000 000 000 000 000 000    011  ij ij ij ij i S t t t t Cid j 0  0 0 10  10 10  1    14 Table 1 A sample telecom dataset  S j  C id i  1 S  2 S  3 S  4 S  5 S  1 Cid  000\002\003\004 005\002\006\004 005\002\007\004 005\002\010\004 005\002\011\004 2 Cid  000\002\011\004 006\002\005\004 000\002\012\004 005\002\012\004 000\002\013\004 3 Cid  005\002\006\004 005\002\006\004 005\002\013\004 005\002\000\004 005\002\010\004 4 Cid  012\002\007\004 013\002\006\004 011\012\002\014\004 005\002\000\004 011\006\002\010\004 5 Cid  012\002\010\004 005\002\006\004 014\000\002\013\004 010\002\012\004 005\002\006\004 6 Cid  010\002\011\004 011\002\000\004 000\002\006\004 012\002\006\004 012\002\005\004 7 Cid  000\002\012\004 012\002\003\004 000\002\010\004 005\002\010\004 000\003\002\010\004 8 Cid  012\012\002\011\004 011\005\002\011\004 000\013\002\013\004 011\002\013\004 013\002\012\004 9 Cid  000\000\002\003\004 000\003\002\003\004 000\013\002\006\004 003\002\014\004 012\002\006\004 10 Cid  011\002\006\004 000\010\002\006\004 000\005\002\003\004 011\002\013\004 005\002\011\004 11 Cid  000\002\012\004 013\011\002\012\004 014\002\013\004 012\002\014\004 012\007\002\000\004 12 Cid  006\002\006\004 013\002\013\004 014\002\013\004 011\002\013\004 005\002\012\004 13 Cid  012\002\010\004 005\002\014\004 014\002\000\004 014\005\002\003\004 000\002\014\004 14 Cid  012\005\002\003\004 012\013\002\003\004 000\002\010\004 005\002\006\004 005\002\011\004 15 Cid  005\002\013\004 000\011\002\013\004 005\002\007\004 000\002\011\004 007\002\000\004 16 Cid  011\002\014\004 003\002\013\004 005\002\006\004 013\011\002\007\004 005\002\013\004 Table 2 The degrees of interesting that the customers used the telecom services  S j  Cid i  1 S  2 S  3 S  4 S  5 S  1 Cid  005\002\011\004\004 005\002\000\004\004 005\002\000\004\004 005\002\000\004\004 005\002\005\004\004 2 Cid  005\002\000\004\004 005\002\006\004\004 005\002\000\004\004 005\002\005\004\004 005\002\000\004\004 3 Cid  005\002\000\004\004 005\002\000\004\004 005\002\005\004\004 005\002\005\004\004 005\002\000\004\004 4 Cid  005\002\013\004\004 005\002\014\004\004 000\002\005\004 005\002\005\004\004 000\002\005\004 5 Cid  005\002\013\004\004 005\002\000\004\004 000\002\005\004 005\002\010\004\004 005\002\000\004\004 6 Cid  005\002\010\004\004 005\002\011\004\004 005\002\011\004\004 005\002\013\004\004 005\002\012\004\004 7 Cid  005\002\000\004\004 005\002\013\004\004 005\002\011\004\004 005\002\000\004\004 000\002\005\004 8 Cid  000\002\005\004 000\002\005\004 000\002\005\004 005\002\011\004\004 005\002\013\004\004 9 Cid  000\002\005\004 000\002\005\004 000\002\005\004 005\002\006\004\004 005\002\013\004\004 10 Cid  005\002\012\004\004 000\002\005\004 000\002\005\004 005\002\011\004\004 005\002\005\004\004 11 Cid  005\002\000\004\004 000\002\005\004 005\002\014\004\004 005\002\013\004\004 000\002\005\004 12 Cid  005\002\007\004\004 005\002\013\004\004 005\002\014\004\004 005\002\011\004\004 005\002\005\004\004 13 Cid  005\002\013\004\004 005\002\000\004\004 005\002\014\004\004 000\002\005\004\004 005\002\011\004\004 14 Cid  000\002\005\004 000\002\005\004 005\002\011\004\004 005\002\000\004\004 005\002\005\004\004 15 Cid  005\002\011\004\004 005\002\000\004\004 005\002\000\004\004 005\002\000\004\004 005\002\005\004\004 16 Cid  005\002\000\004\004 005\002\006\004\004 005\002\000\004\004 005\002\005\004\004 005\002\000\004\004 Next, the experimental steps are described as follows

The fuzzy confidences of these candidate rules are computed and shown as in Table 7 Table 3    j S S of each telecom service j S  j S    j S S  1 S  0.43 2 S  0.54 3 S  0.47 4 S  0.26 5 S  0.29 Table 4 The fuzzy support and the fuzzy simple correlation coefficient of each member of 2 C  2 C  fsupp  r     2 1 S S  0.33 0.33    2 3 S S  0.35 0.35    2 4 S S  0.16 -0.10    2 5 S S  0.21 0.20 Table 5 The fuzzy support and the fuzzy simple correlation coefficient of each member of  2 C   2 C  fsupp  r     3 1 S S  0.31 0.45    4 1 S S  0.19 0.31    5 1 S S  0.14 -0.15    4 3 S S  0.22 0.42    5 3 S S  0.20 0.26    5 4 S S  0.11 0.03 Table 6 The fuzzy support and the fuzzy simple correlation coefficient of each member of 3 C  3 C  fsupp  r      2 3 1 S S S  0.27 0.36      3 2 1 S S S  0.27 0.52     3 1 2 S S S  0.27 0.46 Table 7 The fuzzy confidences of the candidate targetoriented fuzzy correlation rules generated from 2 L and 3 L  Rules  fconf  1 S 000 2 S  0.77 2 S 000 1 S  0.61 2 S 000 3 S  0.65 3 S 000 2 S  0.74 1 S 000  2 S  3 S   0.63 2 S 000  1 S  3 S   0.50 3 S 000  1 S  2 S   0.57  2 S  3 S  000 1 S  0.77  1 S  3 S  000 2 S  0.87  1 S  2 S  000 3 S  0.82 According to Table 7, two interesting fuzzy correlation rules with 2 S are obtained

 1 S  3 S  000 2 S 15  1 S  2 S  000 3 S 16 From the rule \(15\, we can see that there is a strong relationship between telecom services 1 S  3 S and telecom service 2 S In addition, the rule \(16\ show us that there is a strong relationship between telecom services 1 S  2 S and telecom service 3 S In original telecom database 1 S represents the dramatic service 2 S represents the adult service 3 S represents the sport service  5. Conclusions  In this paper, to discover the strong correlations between a specific telecom service and other services we propose an algorithm for mining the target-oriented fuzzy correlation rules. Our experimental results can find out the services highly related to the most popular telecom service. Of course, this kind of information is quite useful for the telecom service provider to provide the appropriate services to their customers and remove useless services to reach effective churn management in telecommunications industry  6.

to discover important characteristic patterns Therefore the proposed method is particularly important in the case that the number of attributes is larger 3 Characteristic patterns and possible patterns We note the results of Figure 6\(e and Figure 6\(f The results show many possible patterns are discovered in the case that the number of attributes is large and the rate of missing values is high The proposed method uses the number of examples that do not include missing values in all attributes in order to calculate possible supports In this case many examples tend to include missing values in some attributes The number tends to be huge Therefore the possible supports tend to be evaluated as larger than the characteristic supports We think this is the reason many possible patterns are discovered If it is necessary to discover all characteristic patterns the proposed method needs to keep all possible supports However it is important to decrease the number of possible patterns because many possible patterns require much memory space The space may give large impacts to the calculation speed On the other hand as the number of attributes is large the possibility that characteristic patterns including all attributes are discovered tends to be small and the characteristic patterns tend to be composed of only parts of attributes So if we aim at the discovery of characteristic patterns whose numbers are smaller than or equal to the user-deﬁned number of attributes we may be able to estimate smaller possible supports For example we arrange attributes in descending order of the frequencies of examples including missing values and accumulate the frequencies in the order until the number of attributes arrives at the user-deﬁned maximum number of attributes In the case that the number of examples that include multiple missing values is small this method can appropriately estimate the number  n  P 002   of examples that do not include missing values in attribute patterns  P 002  Here P 002 is composed of attributes whose number is user-deﬁned maximum number On the other hand in the case that the number of the examples is large this method may not be able to estimate it appropriately This is because many examples may be doubly counted The number of examples that does not include the missing values in P 002 may be smaller than n  P all   Therefore it is necessary to apply other methods to evaluate the number in the latter case We may be able to use sampling methods of attribute patterns In future work we will try to consider estimation methods for a smaller number 4 Generality of the proposed method Real data sets include many missing values For example in the case of a questionnaire respondents do not always answer all the questions The unanswered questions become missing values Also in the case of medical eld doctors do not always perform all tests on all patients and ask them the same questions owing to the restrictions of time and cost The unperformed tests and the unanswered questions become missing values In addition parts of the collected data may be destroyed owing to human errors breakdown of machines and poor transmission environments The destroyed data becomes missing values On the other hand the proposed method deals with missing values without depending on the application tasks Therefore the method can be applied to many application tasks In this paper we showed only the experimental results based on the synthetic data However numerical experiments based on real medical data are performed and the results are similar to the results shown in this section In future work we are planning to consider whether the characteristic patterns have larger impact We believe the proposed method efﬁciently acquires characteristic patterns composed of items from the tabular structured data IV S UMMARY AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we proposed a method that discovers characteristic patterns from tabular structured data including missing values The method efﬁciently uses the information included in the data without deleting examples including missing values or completing missing values Also the method generates both attribute patterns and attribute value patterns step-wisely This paper applies the proposed method to synthetic numerical data and veriﬁes the effectiveness of the proposed method In future work we will try to apply the proposed method to many application elds and to verify the effectiveness of the method For example we are planning to apply the method to medical data nancial data and so on Also we will try to consider a method that estimates possible supports more appropriately in order to decrease the number of generated possible patterns Lastly we will try to expand the method to cover the sequential data including missing values R EFERENCES  R  A gra w al and R  S rikant Fast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules in Large Databases  Proc
