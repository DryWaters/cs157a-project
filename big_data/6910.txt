Finding Maximal Frequent Itemsets over Online Data Streams Adaptively Daesu Lee Department of Computer Science Yonsei University, Korea dslee@database.yonsei.ac.kr Wonsuk Lee Department of Computer Science Yonsei University, Korea leewo@database.yonsei.ac.kr Abstract Due to the characteristics of a data stream, it is very important to confine the memory usage of a data mining process regardless of the amount of information generated in the data stream. For this purpose, this paper proposes a 
CP-tree  Compressedprefix tree  that can be effectively used in finding either frequent or maximal frequent itemsets over an online data stream. Unlike a prefix tree, a node of a CP-tree can maintain the information of several itemsets together. Based on this characteristic, the size of a CP-tree can be flexibly controlled by merging or splitting nodes. In this paper, a mining method employing a CP-tree is proposed and an adaptive memory utilization scheme is also presented in order to maximize the mining accuracy of the proposed method for confined memory space at all times. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is analyzed by a series of experi 
ments to identify its various characteristics 1. Introduction With the rapid development of information technology, the amount of information has been increasing faster than ever in various domains. Furthermore depending on the characteristics of an application domain, its information is produced in diverse forms A data stream is one of such forms and is a massive unbounded sequence of data elements continuously generated at a rapid rate. Due to this reason, it is impossible to maintain all the elements of a data stream Consequently, on-line data stream processing should satisfy the following requirem 
element should be examined at most once to analyze a data stream. Second, memory usage for data stream analysis should be restricted finitely although new data elements are continuously generated in a data stream Third, newly generated data elements should be processed as fast as possible to produce the up-to-date analysis result of a data stream, so that it can be instantly utilized upon request. To satisfy these requirements, data stream processing sacrifices the correctness of its analysis result by allowing some error Recently, various algorithm proposed to extract different types of knowledge em 
bedded in a data stream. The sticky sampling method 11], the Lossy Counting algorithm and the estDec me item sets over a data stream. In the Lossy Counting algorithm, to reduce the memory usage of a mining process, the counts of frequent itemsets can be kept in a secondary storage and only a buffer for the batch-processing of transactions is kept in main memory. As the buffer is enlarged, more number of newly generated transactions can be batch-processed together, so that the 
algorithm is more efficiently processed. When the number of frequent itemsets is large, accessing the information of frequent itemsets in a secondary disk needs more time. Due to this reason, this algorithm is not appropriate for an online data stream For finding frequent itemsets, we have proposed the estDec method to m i nim ize the num ber of item sets to be monitored. In this method, an itemset whose support is greater than a predefined significant support S sig  S 
sig S min is regarded as a significant itemset where S min is a given minimum support. Each significant item-set in a data stream is represented by an individual node of a prefix tree. Consequently, the resulting set of frequent itemsets in a data stream can be found instantly at any moment. As the number of significant itemsets in a data stream is increased, the size of the prefix tree that represents these itemsets become larger. Consequently, the memory usage of the 
prefix tree is also increased. Once the size of a prefix tree becomes larger than the size of available memory space, no new significant itemset can be inserted to the prefix tree, so that the estDec method will not work properly any longer Proceedings of the Fifth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDMê05 1550-4786/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE 


An item to reduce the memory usage of finding frequent itemsets in an incrementally enlarged data set. Unlike a prefix tree, a node of an itemset tree maintains the subset of items in an individual transaction. Given an itemset tree for a set of transactions, if there exists a node representing any subset of items in a newly added transaction T the node is shared to represent the subset of the items in T  Only a node corresponding to the remaining items of T is newly inserted into the itemset tree. By sharing the common subsets of transactions in a data set, it is possible to reduce the required size of memory space Consequently, the size of an itemset tree is smaller than that of a prefix tree for the same data set However, like a prefix tree, an itemset tree has no mechanism to manipulate its size adaptively to confined memory space To cope with this drawback of conventional tree structures, this paper proposes a CP-tree  Compressed-Prefix tree tree in the estDec method. In addition, this paper also introduces the extended version of the estDec method, namely estDec for a CP-tree. Unlike a prefix tree, two or more nodes of a prefix tree can be merged into a single node of a CP-tree as long as the support difference of their corresponding itemsets is within a predefined threshold called a merging gap threshold 0,1 such a node of a CP-tree, only the counts of two representative itemsets are maintained while those of the remaining itemsets are estimated based on the counts of the representative itemsets. By adaptively controlling the value of the number of nodes in a CP-tree can be changed. As the value of is increased more significant itemsets can be represented by a single node of a CP-tree. Consequently, the size of the CP-tree is reduced while the mining result of the estDec method becomes less accurate. However since the size of a CP-tree can be flexibly controlled by merging or splitting nodes, the estDec method can fully utilize confined memory space at all times. This capability is valuable when the number of significant itemsets is fluctuated heavily The rest of this paper is organized as follows Section 2 reviews the estDec method. Section 3 proposes the structure and operations of a CP-tree in detail Section 4 introduces the estDec method which employs a CP-tree to find frequent or maximal frequent itemsets over an on-line data stream. In Section 5, the performance of the estDec method is evaluated by a series of experiments. Finally, Section 6 concludes this paper 2. Preliminaries The estDec method examines each transaction in a data stream one by one without any candidate generation and keeps track of the occurrence count of an itemset in the transactions generated so far by a monitoring tree whose structure is a prefix tree Given the current data stream D k a prefix tree P k has the following characteristics i A prefix tree P k has a root node n root with a null  value and each node except the root node has an item i I  ii Given a node n having an item i n I in a prefix tree P k let s  n root n 1 n 2  n v n be the sequence of nodes in the path from the root n root to the node n and let each node n j have its item i j I 1 j v  node n represents an itemset e n  i 1 i 2  i v i n and maintains the current count C k  e n  The estDec method has two major operations delayed-insertion and pruning operations. Monitoring the count of a new itemset is started only in the following two cases. The first case is when a new 1itemset appears in a newly generated transaction T k In this case, monitoring its count is instantly started by inserting it to the monitoring tree P k without any estimation. The second case is when an insignificant itemset just becomes a significant one due to its appearance of T k Since it becomes an significant itemset, it should be inserted into P k for further monitoring. To find such an n itemset e  n 2 when all of its n 1\are currently maintained in P k the current support of the itemset e is estimated by those of its n 1\ated support is greater than a predefined insertion support S ins the itemset e is inserted. Since the total number of the  n 1 n let c 1  c 2  c n be the set of the current counts of the n 1\onitored in P k  The estimated current count    e C k of the itemset e is obtained by the largest one i.e    e C k  max  c 1  c n  The upper bound of the estimation error for e is   min   max        1 1 n n k k c c c c e C e C The above procedure is a delayed-insertion operation The upper bound of this estimation error is proven to be ignorable when k becom estimating the current count of such an insignificant itemset is called as inserting-count estimation  On the other hand, a pruning operation is performed when the current support of an itemset maintained by P k becomes less than a predefined pruning support S prn  The itemset is regarded as an insignificant itemset that cannot be a frequent itemset in the near future. Upon identifying such an itemset, the node representing such an itemset and all of its descendent nodes are pruned Proceedings of the Fifth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDMê05 1550-4786/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE 


from P k based on the anti-monotonicity of a frequent item P k is located in main memory, its size should be kept smaller than the confined space of main memory at all times. However, its size totally depends on the density of significant itemsets in the current data stream D k with respect to S sig Therefore once the size of a prefix tree exceeds to the size of the confined memory space, it is impossible to monitor any new significant itemset by the delayed-insertion operation. Due to this reason, the mining accuracy of the estDec method can be degraded without any upper bound in this situation 3. Compressible Prefix Tree: CP-tree 3.1. CP-tree To reduce the size of a prefix tree, the information represented by the prefix tree needs to be compressed Two consecutive nodes by a prefix tree are merged in a CP-tree when the current support difference between their corresponding itemsets is less than or equal to a merging gap threshold 0,1\ately, a subtree of a prefix tree can be compressed into a node of a CPtree Definition 1. A mergeable subtree Suppose P k be a prefix tree and S be a subtree of P k  Let e v denote the itemset represented by the root of S and e j denote an itemset represented by a node of S A leaf node of S is not necessarily to be a leaf node of P k  Given a merging gap threshold if all the nodes of the subtree S satisfy the following condition, the subtree S is a mergeable subtree and compressed into a node of a CP-tree Q k that is equivalent to P k   C k  e v  C k  e j  D  k 1 j  S  where S denotes the number of nodes in S  The detailed structure of a node in a CP-tree is defined in Definition 2 Definition 2. CP-node structure Given a mergeable subtree S of a prefix tree P k in D k  let a CP-tree Q k be equivalent to P k  To represent the information of S in Q k a node m of Q k maintains the following four entries m    c S  c L  i item-list The items of the nodes in each level of S are lexicographically ordered and these levelwise lists of items are ordered according to their levels. Let denote the number of items in and the j th item in is represented by  j   1 j    S  The item m   set represented by the root node of S This itemset is called as the shortest itemset of the node m and denoted by m  e S On the other hand, the last item m   S  item set represented by the right-most leaf node in the lowest level of S  The itemset is called as the longest itemset of the node m and denoted by m  e L  ii parent-index list  maintains an entry of a form p  q where p denotes a node identifier of Q k and q denote an index of the item-list of the node p  Suppose a node n x with an item x I is the parent of a node n y with an item y I in the mergeable subtree S The nodes n x and n y of P k are represented by their corresponding items x and y in the item-list of the node m Let a and b denote the item-list indexes of the items x and y respectively, i.e m   a  x and m   b  y The parent-child relationship of the nodes n x and n y in P k is modeled by the two lists and in the node m since m   b  y and m   b  m  a imply the parent of the item y is m   a  x On the other hand, suppose the parent of the root of S is a node n z with an item z in P k and the node n z is in another mergeable subtree  S If  S is represented by a node m of Q k and the itemlist index of the node n z in m is q z i.e m   q z  z  the entry of m  1] is set to m  q z  iii largest count c L the current count of the shortest itemset e S  iv smallest count c S if S 1 c S  c L Otherwise, the current count of the longest itemset e L   Figure 1.

parent of the node n 2 in P k can be inferred by m 1    b and m 1    m 1 1 which imply that the parent of the item b is m 1  1] i.e a The shortest and longest itemsets of m 1 are a and ac respectively 3.2. Merged-count Estimation Given the item-list m   i 1  i 2    i n of a node m in a CP-tree, let j i e denote the itemset represented by i j 1 j n  c S and c L of the node, it is possible to trace the current supports of at most two itemsets i.e. the shortest and longest itemsets 1 i e and n i e as precisely as the estDec method does. Therefore if more than three itemsets are compressed into a single node, the current counts of the remaining itemsets can be estimated by a formula  1 2       n j j m f c e C L i j where f  m  j ation function that can model the count   j i e C in terms of the counts c L and c S of the shortest and longest itemsets e S and e L A function meaningful in an application domain can be employed to define the function f  m  j  To distinguish the inserting-count estimation defined in Section 2, the above estimation is called as merged-count estimation When the current count of an itemset traced by a node of a CP-tree is estimated by the above mechanism, there must be an error count but the possible range of this error count is totally influenced by the value of  3.3. CP-tree Maintenance Given a minimum support S min and a merging gap threshold let Q k 1 denote a CP-tree at a data stream D k 1 As in the estDec method, when a new transaction T k is generated, those paths of Q k 1 that are induced by the items of T k are traversed respectively and the counts of all the nodes in the paths are updated Traversing a CP-tree is virtually the same as traversing a prefix tree s of T k are lexicographically ordered and matched with Q k 1 by a depth-first manner as in a prefix tree. Among the items in the item-list of a node m a leaf-level item is defined as an item i whose item-list index j does not appear in the parent-list of the node m i.e j m   l  l 1 l   where m   j  i  Upon visiting a node m of a CP-tree, let m p denote its parent node and i p denote the last matched leaf-level node in m p If m    m p  i p the first item m  1] is compared with those remaining items of T k that are not yet matched. If the above condition is not met or the item m   is not m a tched, the search is term inated and return to the parent node of the node m If m  1] is matched, the largest count c L of the node m is incremented by one. Let the item m   be the first common item ci 1 in the item-list m  and the remaining items of T k Among the remaining items of T k only those items that are after the item ci 1 are considered to be matched further. Subsequently, find the second common item ci 2 in both the remaining items of and those items in T k that are considered to be matched. Let the item-list indexes of the common items ci 1 and ci 2 be j 1 and j 2 Only when the parent of ci 2 is ci 1 i.e m   j 2  m  j 1 let ci 2 be a new ci 1 and find a new ci 2 by the same manner until there is no such ci 2 in m  If the above recursive search in the node m is terminated by reaching one of the leaf-level items of the node m the child nodes of the node m are searched continuously When the last ci 2 item is not an leaf-level item, the next common item in the remaining items of the two lists is searched by the same way. This procedure is recursively repeated until there is no item to be matched in either of the lists. Furthermore, only when the last item   is m a tched as a leaf-level item the sm allest count m  c S is also increased. If none of the leaf-level items are matched, the search is terminated and returned to the parent of the node m The traversing algorithm is presented in Section 4 While traversing a node m of Q k 1 two major operations node-merge and node-split can be performed additionally. Let  m denote the parent node of m A node-merge operation is only invoked in the following two cases. One is when the current support difference between the shortest itemset of  m and the longest itemset of the node m becomes less than or equal to i.e  k S L D c m c m        This case happens only when the difference between the two counts remains the same and only D  k is increased. The other one is when a new significant itemset e is identified by the inserting-count estimation process, so that a new node for the itemset needs to be inserted as a child of the node m If the current support difference of the estimated support of the new significant itemset and the largest itemset of the node m is less than or equal to the new node is merged into the node m The detailed steps of a node-merging operation are described in Figure 2. On the other hand, a node m of a CP-tree is split into two different nodes when the support differ-ence between its shortest and longest itemsets becomes greater than i.e m.c L m.c S  D k  The difference is enlarged when only m  c L is increased. When a node is split, each of the leaf-level items of the node m  is separated as an individual node of a CP-tree.

Node_split operation 4. Finding Maximal Frequent Itemsets In this section, a modified version estDec of the estDec method is proposed. The proposed method is basically based on the estDec method but the underlying memory structure of significant itemsets is changed from a prefix tree to a CP-tree 4.1 estDec Method In the estDec method, the weight of information in a data stream is differentiated over time by a decay mechanism so that it can find recently frequent itemsets over the data stream To concentrate on developing a mining method based on a CP-tree over a data stream, this paper does not mention about the decay mechanism precisely. However, the same decay mechanism applied to a prefix tree in the estDec method can also be employed to a CP-tree in the estDec method. Furthermore, the estDec method employs delayed-insertion and pruning operations to trace the current supports of only significant itemsets However, the two thresholds: an insertion support S ins and a pruning support S prn used in the estDec method are denoted by a significant support S sig 0 S min  this paper. In other words, delayed-insertion and pruning operations in the estDec method are performed with respect to S sig  If every node which represents a significant itemset is allowed to be merged, an infrequent but significant itemset e i.e S sig S k  e  S min can be merged with frequent itemsets. This can cause false positive or false negative errors in the course of merged-count estimation. To reduce these types of error, a node whose current support is less than a predefined threshold called a merging threshold S merge  S min  sidered as a candidate for a node-merge operation Since a node of a CP-tree can represent multiple itemsets together, the current supports of all the itemsets induced by a node are estimated to find any maximal frequent itemset in the node. As the gap between S merge and S min is enlarged, the possibility that a node representing a maximal frequent itemset is not merged with any other node becomes high. Consequently, the counts of all the maximal frequent itemsets hardly include any estimation error caused by the merged-count estimation Like the estDec method, the estDec method consists of four phases: parameter updating, node restructuring, itemset insertion, and frequent itemset selection. When a new transaction T k in a data stream D k 1 is generated, these phases except the frequent itemset selection phase are performed in sequence. The frequent itemset selection phase is performed only when the up-to-date result set of frequent or maximal frequent itemsets is requested Parameter updating phase The total number of transactions in the current data stream D k is updated Count updating & node restructuring phase This phase is performed by traversing Q k 1 according to the lexicographic order of the items in T k For each visited node m its smallest and largest counts m  c S and m  c L may be incremented as described in Section 3.3. If the updated support of the shortest itemset m  e S becomes less than S sig i.e m  c L  D  k  S sig the node m and all of its descendent nodes are pruned since all the itemsets represented by these nodes are turned out to be insignificant. If the updated support of the longest itemset m  e L is less than S merge or the support difference between the itemsets m  e S and m  e L becomes greater than i.e m  c S  D  k  S merge or m  c L m  c S  D  k  the node m is split. On the other hand, if the updated support of m  e L is greater than S merge and the support difference between m  e S and and m   e L of its parent node m  is less than or equal to i.e m  c S  D  k S merge and m   c L m  c S  D  k these two nodes m and m  are merged Itemset insertion phase The itemset insertion phase is performed to insert any new significant itemset which has not been maintained in Q k 1 As in the estDec method, every single item should be maintained by Q k 1 Consequently, when T k contains any new item that is not in Q k 1 yet, a new node m for the item i T k is inserted as follows m   i  m   root  m  c S  m  c L 1 Proceedings of the Fifth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDMê05 1550-4786/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE 


Subsequently, any insignificant item whose current support is less than S sig is filtered out in the transaction T k Let the filtered transaction be denoted by  k T The monitoring tree Q k 1 is traversed for the filtered transaction k T once again to find out any new significant itemset induced by the items in k T By the same way as in the estDec method, for each significant n itemset e  i 1 i 2  i n  n 1 m of Q k  every n 1\set e which is k n T i e 1 is examined. First of all, check whether all of its n subsets of the itemset e are currently maintained in Q k 1 If the above condition is satisfied, the current support of the itemset e is estimated as    e C as described in Section 2. If sig S e C    a new node w corresponding to the itemset e is inserted to Q k The detailed description of this estimation process is presented w are initiated as follows w   i n 1  w   m  q  w  c S  w  c L     e C where q denotes the item-list index of the item i n in the node m  Maximal frequent itemset selection phase This phase retrieves all the currently frequent or maximal frequent itemsets by traversing the monitoring tree Q k  As in the estDec method, all the nodes whose largest counts c L are less than D  k  S sig can be pruned altogether by traversing the entire monitoring tree. It is called a force-pruning operation, and can be performed periodically traverse m  m p  q  T  y  m p the parent node of a node m T  k the k th item of a transaction T in lexicographical order q the item-list index of the last leaf-level item T  y 1] in node m p 1  if m  1 m p  q and m  1 T  y then 2 m  c L m  c L 1 3      if m  c L  D  k  S sig then 4          pruning m eliminate m and all of its descendent nodes 5      else 6 y y 1 x 2 7 ci 1 m    8 ci 2 find _ com _ item  m   x  T  y  9          while m   ci 2  m  v and x  and y  T do 10             if ci 2 is a leaf-level item then /* v m   ci 1    11                 if x  then 12 m  c S m  c S 1 13                   if m p  c L m  c S  D  k and m  c S  D  k S merge then 14                      node_merge m p  m  15                 if m  c L m  c S  D  k  then 16                    node_split m  17                 if an unvisited child m c of m 18 traverse  m c  m  w  T  y  m   ci 2  w 19                 else return 20             else 21 ci 1 ci 2  22 ci 2 find_com_item  m   x  T  y  find_com_item  m   x  T  y mon item ci in the items m   i  x i  m  and T  j  y j  T where x and y are updated, s.t  x   T y   ci Figure 4. Traverse operation 4.2. Adaptive Memory Utilization Since information embedded in a data stream is more likely to be changed over time, the number of currently significant itemsets is continuously varied However, the size of memory space for a CP-tree is confined. In order to minimize the estimation error caused by the merged-count estimatioin, it is very important to keep the value of as small as possible The size of a CP-tree is inversely proportional to the value of In order to adaptively control the memory utilization of the estDec method, the value of should be dynamically changed in the parameter update phase of the estDec method Based on the ratio of the current memory usage over given confined memory space, the value of is dynamically changed in the parameter updating phase of the estDec method. Let M U and M L denote the upper and lower bounds of desired memory usage respectively for given confined memory space M A  Whenever the current memory usage M C satisfies the following conditions, the new value new of a merging gap threshold is adjusted adaptively as follows new   0  if if L U A L C old U C old M M M M M M M where denotes the step-wise increment of for each adaptation and is defined by a user. As the values M A M U and M U M L become larger, the value of can also be larger. As long as the current memory usage M C of a CP-tree becomes greater than the upper bound M U the value of is increased. As a result, more nodes can be merged and the size of the CP-tree is reduced On the other hand, when M C becomes less than the lower bound M L the value of is decreased to enhance the mining accuracy of the CP-tree, so that the size of the CP-tree is increased. By setting the lower bound M L high enough, the memory utilization of the estDec  method is kept high. On the other hand, by setting the upper bound M U low enough, the estDec method can be executed without causing any memory overflow 5. Performance Evaluation In this section, the performance of the estDec  method is analyzed by two data sets T10.I4.D1000K and WebLog The data set T10.I4.D1000K is generated by the same method as described in The data set WebLog is a real web-page access log data.

Performance of the estDec  method with a dynamic adaptation technique of secutive web-pages accessed by a user are considered as a semantically atomic unit of activities, i.e., a transaction. The total number of items, i.e., the number of web-pages, is 545. The minimum, maximum, and average lengths of a transaction in the data set WebLog are 2, 30, and 5 respectively. In addition, the total number of transactions is 500,000. In all experiments the transactions of a data set are looked up one by one in sequence to simulate the environment of an online data stream and a force-pruning operation is performed in every 1000 transactions.

This is because more nodes are merged as the value of is increased or the value of S merge is decreased. Figure 5-\(d e estDec  method is order-independent. For this experiment T10.I4.D1000K_R is generated with the reversely ordered transactions of T10.I4.D1000K while T10.I4 D1000K_C is generated with two consecutive datasets i.e., one with the transactions having odd number TID and the other with the transactions having even number TID The value of S merge is set to 0.003 In Figure 6, the performance of the estDec method is closely compared with that of the estDec method on the data set T10.I4.D1000K In this experiment, the value of is fixed. For the same value of S sig the memory usage of the estDec method is always less than that of the estDec method.

memory requirement of the estDec method. The requirement is represented by the ratio of the size of memory space required by the estDec method over that required by the estDec method to execute the same dataset. By varying the value of S sig Figure 6-\(c Figure 6-\(d\mining accuracy of finding frequent and maximal frequent itemsets respectively When the value of S merge gets higher, the ASE of the estDec method becomes closer to that of the estDec method since less nodes corresponding to maximal frequent itemsets are merged. In Figure 6-\(e\the average processing time per transaction is compared. It is inversely proportional to the memory usage. This is mainly because the processing time to interpret the information of the itemsets in a node of a CP-tree becomes longer as either the value of is larger or the value of S merge is smaller Knowledge embedded in a data stream is more likely to be changed over time Figure 7 shows how the estDec method can adaptively maximize the utilization of confined memory space. In this experiment, the data set WebLog is used. The values of S min  S sig and S merge are set to 0.003, 0.1 S min and 0.003 respectively. Furthermore, the values of M U  M L and M A are set to 95MB, 85MB, and 100MB respectively The initial value of is set to 0 and two different values of a user-defined increment are used. The estDec method fails to be executed after the 1 10 5th transaction. This is because the size of its prefix tree becomes larger than that of the confined memory space On the other hand, there is no problem to execute the estDec method by adjusting the value of adaptively for the same situation. Figure 7-\(a\illustrates the trace of the value of in this experiment. As shown in Figure 7-\(b\emory usage of the estDec method is kept between M U and M L at all times. As expected the value of is more widely fluctuated for the larger value of Figure 7-\(c ASE s of the the estDec method in finding frequent and maximal frequent itemsets. The ASE of finding frequent itemsets is much higher than that of finding maximal frequent itemsets 6. Concluding Remarks For a given value of S min the total number of frequent itemsets can be varied continuously over time without any upper bound. On the other hand, the up-to-date mining result of an on-line data stream should be traced in real-time and available at any moment. For this reason, the current counts of all the significant itemsets are kept in main memory by the estDec method. However, it is impossible to guarantee all of them to be maintained in confined memory space at all times. To cope with this problem, a CP-tree is proposed in this paper. Although the proposed estDec  method can be used to find either frequent itemsets or maximal frequent itemsets, it provides better accuracy for finding maximal frequent itemsets as illustrated in the experiments. By making the value of a merging threshold S merge large enough, the estDec method can find the set of maximal frequent itemsets as accurately as the estDec method can do while the memory usage can be minimized. Although the average processing time of the estDec method is slightly increased, the proposed method successfully provides a way to accommodate the unpredictable number of significant itemsets generated in the future of a data stream not in a secondary storage but in confined memory space References   R.C.

dress a related problem In the problem is to monitor continuously changing numerical values which could represent frequency counts in a distributed setting The objective is to maintain a list of the top k aggregated values where each aggregated value represents the sum of a set of individual values each of which is stored on a different node The work of assumes a single-le v e l communication topology and does not consider how to manage synopsis precision in hierarchical communication structures using in-network aggregation which is the main focus of this paper The work most closely related to ours is the recent work of Greenwald and Khanna which addresses the problem of computing approximate quantiles in a general communication topology Their technique can be used to nd frequencies of frequent items to within a conìgurable error tolerance The work in focuses on providing an asymptotic bound on the maximum load on any link our result adheres to the same asymptotic bound It does not however address how best to conìgure a precision gradient in order to minimize load which is the particular focus of our work 5 Summary In this paper we studied the problem of nding frequent items in the union of multiple distributed streams The central issue is how best to manage the degree of approximation performed as partial synopses from multiple nodes are combined We characterized this process for hierarchical communication topologies in terms of a precision gradient followed by synopses as they are passed from leaves to the root and combined incrementally We studied the problem of nding the optimal precision gradient under two alternative and incompatible optimization objectives 1 minimizing load on the central node to which answers are delivered and 2 minimizing worst-case load on any communication link We then introduced a heuristic designed to perform well for the second objective in practice when data does not conform to worst-case input characteristics Our experimental results on three real-world data sets showed that our methods of setting the precision gradient are greatly superior to na  ve strategies under both metrics on all data sets studied Acknowledgments We thank Arvind Arasu and Dawn Song for their valuable input and assistance References  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In VLDB  1994  I Akamai T echnologies Akamai http://www akamai.com   A Ak ella A Bharambe M Reiter  and S Seshan Detecting DDoS attacks on ISP networks In PODS Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams  2003  A Arasu and G S Manku Approximate quantiles and frequency counts over sliding windows In PODS  2004  B Babcock and C Olston Distrib uted top-k monitoring In SIGMOD  2003  M Charikar  K  Chen and M F arach-Colton Finding frequent items in data streams In International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming  2002  E Cohen and M Strauss Maintaining time-decaying stream aggregates In PODS  2003  G Cormode and S Muthukrishnan What s hot and whatês not Tracking frequent items dynamically In PODS  2003  E D Demaine A Lopez-Ortiz and J I Munro Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space In European Symposium on Algorithms  2003  DynaServ er R UBis and R UBBos http://www.cs rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer   eBay Inc eBay  http://www.ebay.com   C Estan and G V a r ghese Ne w directions in traf c measurement and accounting In SIGCOMM  2002  M F ang N Shi v akumar  H  Garcia-Molina R Motwani and J Ulmann Computing iceberg queries efìciently In VLDB  1998  P  B Gibbons and Y  Matias Ne w sampling-based summary statistics for improving approximate query answers In SIGMOD  1998  P  B Gibbons and S T irthapura Estimating simple functions on the union of data streams In Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  2001  M Greenw ald and S Khanna Po wer conserving computation of order-statistics over sensor networks In PODS  2004  J Han J Pei G Dong and K W ang Ef cient computation of iceberg queries with complex measures In SIGMOD  2001  Internet2 Internet2 Abilene Netw ork http abilene.internet2.edu   R M Karp S Shenk er  and C H P apadimitriou A simple algorithm for nding frequent elements in streams and bags ACM Trans Database Syst  2003  H.-A Kim and B Karp Autograph T o w ard automated distributed worm signature detection In Proceedings of the 13th Usenix Security Symposium  2004  A Manjhi V  Shkapen yuk K Dhamdhere and C Olston Finding recently frequent items in distributed data streams Technical report 2004 http://www cs.cmu.edu/òmanjhi/freqItems.pdf   G S Manku and R Motw ani Approximate frequenc y counts over data streams In VLDB  2002  Open Source De v elopment Netw ork Inc Slashdot http://slashdot.org  Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
