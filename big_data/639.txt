Rough Set Theory\(RST\ and Granular Computing\(GrC\ are introduced into MEA to mine and discover the knowledge produced in the process of evolution. Firstly it was used to analyze correlation between individual variables and their fitness function. Secondly eigenvector was defined to judge the characteristic of the problem. And then the knowledge discovered by RST was used to select evolution subspace and to realize knowledge-based evolution. It takes a big step in imitating human thinking improving the performance of the MEA effectively. Experiment results have shown that the proposed method has higher searching efficiency, faster convergent speed, and good performance for deceptive problem, multi-modal problem and multi-objective problems  Index Terms-Rough set theory, Granular Computing, Mind Evolutionary Algorithms, knowledge discovery, knowledge evolution  I  I NTRODUCTION   John Holland proposed Genetic Algorithm in 1960s. As an intelligent optimization method, it is preferable for complex systems H o w e ve r  i t s i n t e l l i g e n t f e a t u r e i s due  t o  na t u ra l  selection strategy, which will provide evolution opportunity on the one hand and will also cause degeneration inevitably on the other hand Comparing with natural evolution with hundreds of millions years, the modern human civilized history has only thousands of years. However, the human society obtains unprecedented development in a short time; it is created by the mankind with high intelligence, not driven by biology evolution. The origin is that human can study and make use of thinking ability  Mind Evolutionary Algorithms\(MEA\s a new type of evolutional computing method that simulates evolutional process of peopleês thoughts 4 It uses the concept populationê of GA, but is radically different from it Similartaxisé and çdissimilationé operators are presented Since memory function and directional study mechanism are introduced and population optimization replaces the individual optimization, the intelligence of the algorithm is improved and the search efficiency is also enhanced. MEA has successfully solved the problems of precocity and slowness of convergence 6 But among the algorithm existing, the study realized is only based on individual instance, and it is a mechanical learning method, so it still lacks effective knowledge acquisition mechanism. It does not embody the function of abstracting and utilizing knowledge in the process of human thinking activity  Rough Set Theory 7, 8 and granular computing 9-1  which are thought as the effective tools on knowledge abstracting and analysis are used in this paper to discover the knowledge of the data in the evolution process and guide the action of the evolutionary algorithm through the knowledge discovered. So Mind Evolutionary Algorithm has taken a step in imitating human thinking, and its performance has been effectively improved II  B ASIC CONCEPTION   Rough Set Theory is a mathematics theory of analyzing the data. While analyzing the data, it only needs the data set that correlate with the question without any transcendent information, and it can analyze and deal with the information which is inaccurate, inconsistent or incomplete effectively From the information above, it can find hidden knowledge and reveal its potential rule A Knowledge Representation SystemÑKRS 7   Knowledge representation is achieved through knowledge expression system. It is composed of object sets whose knowledge is described by the target attributes and themselves. A knowledge representation system can be expressed by   SUCDVf  1  Where U is the universe C  D  R are attribute sets equivalence relation set\, subsets C and D are respectively condition attribute and decision attribute V   r  R V r is the set of attribute value V r is the range of r  R  f  U  R  V is an information function, it appoints the attribute value of each object in the universe. The definition \(1\ makes it possible to express knowledge in form of decision table B. Indiscernibility relation  In rough set theory, knowledge is connected with classification while knowledge is regarded as an ability to classify the objects represented by the attribute set. The module of knowledge is composed of the concept that is generated by classification. The classification is substituted by equivalence relation in rough set theory  Let K  U  R be an information system, then in any B  R there is an associated equivalence relation IND R  B          R IND B xx U U a B ax ax    2  IND R  B is called the B indiscernibility relation. The equivalence relation in the universe and the equivalence classes which formed by the universe have revealed the 978-1-4244-2114-5/08/$25.00 © 2008 IEEE 5298 Proceedings of the 7th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation June 25 - 27, 2008, Chongqing, China

The equivalence classes formed by equivalence relation are denoted by x  B      B x yUyBx  3  U  B stands for all of the equivalence classes in the universe lead out by R forming a cluster of partition to U  This partition of the universe is denoted by U  B      B UB x x U  4 C. Space partition of searching space based on indiscernibility relation  The data in the evolution process can be regarded as a knowledge system. Based on the indiscernibility relation in RST, the solution space of MEA can be divided into different regions by partitioning fitness function or object function Suppose that a multi-optimal problem is given a nonempty set S as the solution space of MEA. Let S be a bounded set in the n dimension Euclidean space R n as   1  n iii Sab    where a i  b i i=1,2  n Marking any individual in MEA operation as X  X  x 1  x 2    x n  x i   a i  b i   x i  is called variable phenotype, in order to explain conveniently, it is called individual variable here, and n is the number of the variable The  corresponding fitness function or each object function is 12    vv vh F ff f    h is the number of the object function X and its corresponding fitness function F constitute an ordered pair X  F hence consisting the universe U   If the interval a i  b i  o f e ach v a r i ab le  x i is divided probably, for instance, by m division method, that is, the solution space S of MEA can be divided into a series of solution subspace S  where S  S  11  1  nm ii ii ii ik ba ba Sakak mm         5 S  or the union of S  is called optimum-searching subspace  Suppose the bigger the value of the object function is better, and the minimum of the object function can be changed into the maximum of the object function through the proper transformation. Therefore, adopting a set of thresholds  j   j 0  j   j here j is the number of the object function j 1,2   h we define the following equivalent relation  Relation 1 In the evolution process, the solutions in some searching spaces are excellent, that is, the index of each object function is greater than the corresponding threshold  j  1 1  j h vj j Rf   012  6  Relation 2 In the evolution process, the object functions in some solution space are very bad and can not be accepted that is, the index of all the object functions are less than the corresponding threshold  j  2 1  j h vj j Rf   012  7  There are other searching spaces which have the good solutions. The solutions are between relation 1 and relation 2 Therefore, the whole solution space can be divided into three parts as follows 1  j h POS v j j SSfSS     012 012 015  8 1  j h NEG v j j SSfSS     012 012 015  9 B ON POS NEG SSSS   10  Where S POS is the subset of solution space where exist the excellent solutions S NEG is the subset of the bad solution space S BON is the subset of the solution space which has the optimum solution potentially. It can be seen in Fig. 1. It can be evolved directionally in the different areas based on the real situation  Fig. 1.

If P  R and P 015 then  P is the indiscernibility relation of P marked as IND  P The independent equivalent classification can be divided by any subset P  R and the equivalent classification is denoted as granule   The equivalence classification of U ind P  is called the granule with knowledge P Elements in the same granule is indiscernibility. To any element in the granule, its position in the universe can be marked with its subscript. In this paper each granule with knowledge P is denoted by binary string with length L   Suppose there are L elements u 1  u 2    u l    u L 1  l  L n universe U for the subset Y  i in U ind P  the coding space is defined as a mapping function from integer domain to binary space f  Z   0,1 L and the binary string of granule Y  i can be respectively expressed as 12     ilL Yaaaa   11  1   1 0   li l li if u Y alL if u Y    012   12 E Binary matrix between condition attribute and decision attribute 13   Given granule X i with knowledge P in its condition attribute set, where the value of i can change from number 1 to n and given granule Y i with knowledge Q in its decision attribute, where j can change from number 1 to m Then the dependent relationship that decision attribute Y on condition attribute X can be determined by doing the operation of X i  Y i  In order to make the calculation convenient, matrix A X and A Y  are adopted to denote the binary granule with condition attribute and decision attribute respectively. Binary logic operation based on matrix is introduced to pursuit the relation between fitness function and the variable of individual 5299

Algorithm description  To an evolutionary optimal searching problem, the distribution of the optimal solution in the solution space is unknown, and to some complicated problems, such as multipeak function or deceptive function, the optimal solution may be distribute in different areas of the solution space. So, in the algorithm of KMEA, it produces bigger initial groups in the solution space at random, then, it makes the initial group similartaxis to search the whole solution space in order to get data as much as possible. The knowledge of the initial group can be discovered by dissimilation process. Then, a new generation of optimal searching subspace is generated under the guidance of the knowledge discovered. Now, each subspace obtained can do the similartaxis process. The dissimilation process can be done when the population in each group is mature. At last, adjust the evolution subspace again according to the knowledge discovered. The algorithm is showed as ALG.1 __________________________________________________  ALG.1 Knowledge based Mind Evolutionary Algorithm input: The desired question and parameter of KMEA output: Optimum results begin t 0 12 0  0 0  0 n POP   xx x Produce the initial group at random 0  0 B similartaxis POP  make the initial group similartaxis 00 0 12    0  Ns S S S S dissimilation B M N     Confirm N s superior solution subspaces, and regard the whole solution space S as a subspace too while \(not termination-condition\ do t  t 1 for \(all subspace\do  // similartaxis in each group        t iiGsm B t similartaxis S N P P    end 12 1 2 1                 tt t Ns Ns Ns S S S S dissimilation B t B t BtB t MN      Dissimilation process: adjust the evolution subspace according to the knowledge discovered end end __________________________________________________ B. Procedure similartaxis   The pseudocode in the similartaxis process is shown as ALG.2. Firstly, spread N G individuals into the subspace t i S at random. Secondly, calculate the individual's score and sort them in order. Then, select N G  P s superior individuals according to the proportion P s Finally, make mutation to these superior individuals based on the probability P m of mutation forming the new group and doing iterative operation to the new group formed. This process is similar to the similartaxis operator of MEA in the aspect of study, and the difference is that MEA regards the superior individual with the highest score as the centre to spread while the similartaxis process chooses lots of superior individuals and spreads the new generation by these superior individuals. So the later is better in the aspect of keeping the groupês diversity than the former at the same time, the similartaxis process adopted the iterative operation and select mechanism, so that it is propitious to the evolution of the group, and it can improve the ability of local searching and optimal searching effectively __________________________________________________ ALG.2 Procedure similartaxis input  t iG sm SN PP   output  i B t  begin 12       t ini P OP t t t t S   xx x   ii s core f POP t   while    do i TPOPt true 015      iis P OP t s POP t P   Rank Selection      ii im P OP t POP t m POP t P     Learning from the superior individuals  ii s core f POP t   Evaluating individuals    ii B t Update B t   Update the information on the local billboard end end  C. Procedure dissimilation  In the process of dissimilation, the knowledge discovered is used to confirm the subspace to be used by the similartaxis process next time. When the similartaxis process of the group is over, the evolutionary information of each group is memorized on its billboard, and the information on the billboard is gathered by the function of Gather o form information base. Then the individual and score are discretized into N grades and M grades respectively by function Discretize to form the discretized information table \(DIB, for short\ When the redundancy information is eliminated 5300 


calculate the relation matrix T X  Y where the matrix reflects the relation between individual variable and object function. Then base on the matrix T X  Y the eigenvector can be gained, and the type of the desired question and the optimal searching subspace of next step can be confirmed.

Binary relation of individual variable and fitness function  Discretize individual X and its fitness function Y into N grades and M grades respectively, where N and M are integer and they are bigger than number one. The corresponding value region after discretization are V X 0,1   N 1} and V F 0,1   M 1}. The discretization of individual variable is equivalent to divide the solution space of the individual variable into N independent subspaces. Base on RST, the phenotype x i of the individual variable is regarded as condition attribute, and the fitness function is regarded as decision attribute. After discretization, a series of equivalence classification x i  j and f  k are formed, where the range of j is from number 1 to N while k is from number 1 to M and then transform it into binary granule  The function max f 1  x 1  x 2 in Table 2, which is shown in Fig. 2 is a representative multi-optimal function. It has multi global maximum and minimum as well as local extremum. In this paper, we take global maximum as the example to explain the algorithm  Fig. 2. The figure of max f 1  x 1  x 2   This function has two variables x 1 and  x 2 when the simulartaxis process of the initial group is over, a series of data X t  F t can be obtained, here, the range of t is from number 1 to Q and Q is the quantity of the individuals produced in the simulartaxis process. Discretize the variable x 1  and  x 2 into 21 grades, and the discretization of fitness function is also 21 grades. After that, the matrix 12  xf x f TT  can be computed and expressed as Fig. 3. It reflects the relation between each subspace of individual variables x 1 and  x 2  and its fitness function. Therefore, the panorama of the problem can be found out by the relation of individual variable and its fitness function, and the binary granule computing is used to find the relation. The type of the question can be confirmed and the direction of searching can be selected when the relation of variable subspace and its fitness function has been mastered efficiently. This process is similar to human beings and with the finer classification, more details will be extracted  Fig. 3. Relation graphic of individual subspace and fitness of max f 1  x 1  x 2  E. Eigenvector of the optimization problem    In order to judge the type of the questions optimized by the data that generated in the former evolution process, the contribution of each subspace of some variable to the fitness function should be measured first, and the variable comes from individual. Define the following function     1 1,2   ji k k jk Gx MAXgg t k k M   17  Where j 1,2   N stands for different subspace x i stands for the ith variable of the individual. Calculate the individual variable x i and the contributions that different subspaces to their fitness function respectively, forming the eigenvector which will be used to judge the type of the optimal problem    1    1,2 iijiNi Gx Gx G x G x j N    18  Calculate the eigenvectors G  x 1 nd G  x 2 f max f 1  x 1  x 2  and plot them in Fig. 4  5301 


 Fig. 4. eigenvectors of max f 1  x 1  x 2   After some generations evolution, no matter the optimal solution of the problem has been obtained or not, review the eigenvector G  x i of each variable of individual based on the knowledge discovered. If the eigenvector is monotone, it is a single-model problem; if it is non-monotone and with only one maximum, it also can be regard as a single-model problem; if there are more than one maximum in the eigenvector, it is a multi-model problem and maybe it is a deceptive problem The function max f 1  x 1  x 2 is a typical multi-model problem, it can be find out by the eigenvectors G  x 1 nd G  x 2   After getting the type of the desired question, the searching speed can be improved by confirming a subspace which is used for optimal searching to a single-model problem. However, to a multi-model problem, many optimal searching spaces can be confirmed based on the information offered by the binary matrix. Thus, the algorithmês optimal searching efficiency can be enhanced and the deceptive problem can be avoided F. Confirming the evolutionary subspace  The choice of superior group is based on ranking method in the algorithm of MEA at present, and the quantity N S of the superior group chosen is decided. When N S is smaller, the task of the algorithm is light, but to a multi-model problem, it may leak the global optimal point; when N S is greater, the task is too heavy to a single-model problem, and the efficiency of optimal searching will be reduced  Using the threshold value    0     M  defined above the algorithm divide the subspace into superior solution region  S POS boundary region S BON and negative solution region S NEG  according to expressions \(8\ and \(9\ The individual subspace in the S POS is corresponding with good fitness function and in the S BON the individual of the subspace in the boundary region is likely to be the potential excellent solution. For example the function max f 1  x 1  x 2  is a difficult multi-optimal problem and the threshold value is choice as  6  14 If the fitness value F of the function is greater than or equal to the number of  after discretization, the corresponding individual subspace was denoted as superior solution region  Fig. 5. The distribution of superior solution region of function max f 1  x 1  x 2   The subspace with potential optimal solution of function max f 1  x 1  x 2  can be clearly seen in Fig. 5. Choose nine subspaces showed in the picture above. Then, expand them appropriately with expand coefficient   1\, and take these subspaces as the evolution space, so that we can find out lots of optimal solution of the function in the space. The subspaces confirmed have been shown in Table 1. The groups and their quantity which confirmed by this means is based on the knowledge produced in the process of evolution. In this way it can prevent the influence to the efficiency of the calculation and it also can prevent the influence to the result of optimal searching when the value of N S which has been chosen is too big or too small Table 1.

The evolution process of every subspace shows as Fig. 6\(a\. The optimum solution of the function has been found out in each superior solution region. The blue broken line stands for the result searched which taking the whole solution space as an independent searching space. Fig. 6\(b shows the records when MEA adopts the same tactics to restrain the population, and the records include the evolution process of the former nine superior groups in each generation Contrast the two methods, it is easy to find out that the algorithm of KMEA which based on the guidance of knowledge can find out all of the nine optimal solutions of the function max f 1  x 1  x 2  and the convergent speed of KMEA is faster than the speed of common algorithm of MEA  a\                                                               \(b Fig. 6. Contrast between KMEA and MEA  a\The evolution process of every subspace of function max f 1  x 1  x 2 in KMEA, \(b\ The evolution process of the former nine superior populations in MEA    S IMULATION EXPERIMENT   In order to test the efficiency of the algorithm which has been brought forward in this paper, the functions in Table 2 are taken for simulation. The parameters of KMEA in the simulation process are set as follows: the initial population is 200, the group N G in the similartaxis process is 100, the probability of choice P s is 0.4, the probability of variation P m is 0.1, and the iteration times in the process of similartaxis are 100. While the parameters of MEA in the simulation process are set as follows: the group is 100, the superior group N S is 20 5302 


and the temporary group N T is 80. Each function has been tested for thirty times, and the results are shown in Table 3 Table 2.

To a function with multi-optimal points they ought to find out all of the optimal points, so the standard of convergence is to find out the whole optimal points of every function. The data in Table 3 are the mean values after the convergence of the algorithm, and the calculation time of object function is the calculation time before all the optimal solutions are found. The result in Table 3 shows that the KMEA algorithm is convergent in the thirty times test, while the MEA algorithm is partly convergent. The precision of searching of KMEA is higher than MEA, and the calculation time of object function is obviously less than MEA algorithm    C ONCLUSION   In the course of human thinking, the main content which is also regarded as the basic of human thought is that people analyze the thing and its course, obtain the knowledge and use it to infer or make decision  In this paper, a huge amount of data is regarded as a knowledge base in the evolution process. The rough set is used to reduce and classify the data and the KMEA is used to divide the individual variable into the different subspaces which are expressed by the binary granule. Based on it, the matrix-based binary granule calculation is introduced to find the relation between the variables and their fitness functions The relation reflects the dependence of fitness function on the different subspaces of variables, and shows the whole outline of the problem as well. This paper defines the eigenvector of the optimization problem, and judges whether the problem belongs to the multi-modal problem by each eigenvector in order to make decision. With the reference of the multipopulation evolution, the whole solution space can be divided into multi optimum searching subspaces with the obtained knowledge. It can form the multi-subpopulation evolution The test function shows that the proposed algorithm is good to increase the convergent speed of the MEA. The proposed algorithm shows the good performance for the multi-modal function and multi-objective optimization. Therefore the knowledge-based algorithm is effective  Because the research of combination of RST and evolution algorithm is inchoate, there are still a lot of questions to be further study. For example, the synthetic and reasoning of knowledge, the expression of the relation of highdimension parameter space, etc. At the same time, the parameter in the algorithm, including the degrees of the data discretization and the size of the granule as well as the problem of how to confirm the threshold value are all need for further study and discussion. All the above will be author's research direction in the future  R EFERENCES  1.John H. Holland Genetic Algorithms Scientific American, 1992. 267\(1\: p 66-72  2.

increased progress following the video conference and synchronous chat sessions helping team members to resolve conflicts and clarify misunderstandings relating to the task  As in most student-based pilots the use of participation incentives becomes even more necessary. The volunteering nature of the project carrying a rather small incentive in terms of extra credit and a small prize meant that more students had the opportunity to opt out from the study. An interesting pattern emerged with participation being affected by the level of cohesion that different groups showed.  Furthermore, it seemed that the second pilot \(being closely related to the first one and following after a short break after the completion of the initial task did not attract the same level of interest and there was inconsistency in terms of motivation for communication collaboration and exchange of ideas. Based on some early feedback comments, it seems that interest levels were affected by the nature of the task \(similar database projects\e team collaboration pattern \(the less active members failed to integrate even if it was only for the second pilot\d the rigid induction process \(although synchronous meetings were offered for the second pilot, it was difficult for least involved team members to catch up and identify their roles\This factor was derived from the different participation patterns of team members according to their perception of the provided incentives  It seems that several teams were positively affected by individuals who showed a lot of enthusiasm leading to heroic efforts and personal intervention These teams were the ones that at critical stages of the collaboration certain key people from both universities would proceed and finish off the deliverables. They were proactive at undertaking a team leader or facilitator role. This factor was derived from those teams that included individual team members undertaking full responsibility towards the end of the task in a completer-finisher role  Another critical aspect that affected all teams during both pilots was the dissemination of information that was based on the briefings posted on the virtual learning environment. The fact that part of the message was initially scrambled and that time zone differences posed a six hour delay meant that collaboration was significantly affected. This factor was derived from the communication of team members with the research team seeking further opportunities of briefings, leading to a number of additional briefing sessions  There is need to further research interaction and communication patterns of participants. For example some inconsistencies were observed with respect to loafing in different teams. Mr S.A. read 267 articles and posted 66 while Miss R.A. read 1016 followed by 28 posts with the worse example of loafing being Mr M.A with 5119 items read and only 2 posted messages Altogether there seems to be an association between the reading and posting patterns. There is also a correlation between the time spent in the environment and the reading of the communication within the team but not with the number of posts. It seems that a significant part of the team spent their time mainly for reading the specification and clarifying the task. This factor was derived from the different results and progress monitored in teams with significantly different communication patterns in terms of consistency, frequency and depth of information  The task domain databases\ affects the end result of the communicating team since it is quite practical and requires less clarification after the initial briefing installation and user help issues are covered. A more theoretical project would require further communication and decision making from the teams. This factor was derived from the different communication patterns followed for different tasks  Factors Source Impact Alignment of human resources TF/RA/MC High Synchronous communication TF/MC/CM Medium Multimedia richness CM/CL/MC Medium Participation incentives RA/CL/MC High Interest levels TF/RA/MC Medium Personal intervention MC/CL/RA High Information dissemination CM/MC/CL Medium Communication patterns CM/CL High Task domain CM/CL/MC High Deliverables MC/RA/CL Progress assessment MC/CL Key MC management/coordination  TF team formation RA role allocation CM communication CL collaboration Table 1: Factors affecting global teams  Furthermore, the design of any deliverables should be based on the needs of each team rather than the task leading to clear agenda items for each meeting that are owned by the different teams. This factor was derived from the communication patterns following a structure similar to the one required for the deliverables Progress assessment should be also based on the different goals of each team rather than the task overall goals. This factor was derived from the different agenda present in the collaborating teams  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 


 Figure 3: Framework for DSD influential factors  As shown in figure 3, the factors affecting global teams and influence DSD can be classified according to the two key variants concerning this project, namely task and team complexity. One of the objectives for the remaining two years of the project will be to identify ways of measuring and providing a more accurate classification of such factors. In the figure the horizontal axis shows how these factors relate to the complexity of the task in hand The vertical axis prioritises the factors affecting global teams according to the structure, communication and collaboration complexity of the team  8. Future Work - Towards a Third Pilot  From the previous sections it is evident that a number of factors affecting DSD and the work of global teams can be identified and their prioritisation may differ significantly depending on the structure of teams, the project tasks and external influences. Our experiences with the first two pilots concluded that it is important to investigate further our hypotheses in more realistic scenarios of distributed development, allowing alternative team structures and focusing on tasks from different stages of the lifecycle, including requirements capture design and programming, proving more demanding than testing in the way teams collaborate and communicate  The previous section provides an overview of the findings and lessons learnt from the two pilot studies between US and UK teams. A different project was assigned to teams residing in the US, Turkey and Panama. The three teams were asked to develop a system that could be used to create and manage groups.  Each country team was asked to deliver one of the components for this system. Each country team s deliverable was further refined into sub components which could be assigned to individual members of the country team. All three teams were required to collaborate on a common interface that supported each of their individual components  Although the factors affecting global teams were identified prior to the beginning of the third pilot they did not affect the design of the task. The aim of the project is to identify different collaboratio n settings and a variety of tasks that are feasible in global software teams. The identification of issues r elating to role allocation, team formation, management and coordination of such teams will have a different weighting according to the task and team structures  9.  Conclusion  This paper provided the basis for further work in global software development teams. The paper discussed the research foundation and provided an overview of the key aspects for the underlying research. It seems that setting up global team simulations is feasible in an educational context but certain difficulties exist when aligning curriculum, working ethos, deadlines and incentives. It is envisaged that the research outcomes could be \(after the evaluation of the industrial patterns\iding evidence of good practice and guidelines for projects exploiting the positive effects of global teams and dispersed resources  References  1  Agerup, K. and Busser, M. \(2004\e-study on collaborative learning in distributed, cross-cultural teams, International Conference on Engineering Education, Gainesville, Fl., October 16-21 2  Aguinis, H. and Henle, C. \(2003\The search for universals in cross-cultural organizational behavior in J.

This figure presents the data flow through main blocks that can be used a few times and special blocks that must execute only particular functions Here also Configurator of chain and Sequences library for WiMAX/UMTS modules are equipped First one is responsible for right construction of next processing path and second one stores necessary number of elements After signal verification system is reconfigured according to input data and with using the chosen protocol type The OUTPUT connects to radio link and then signal must be transmitted over one of six channel types And at the reception side we configure the receiver in relation to transmitted mode 5 HARDWARE PLATFORM SELECTION Current technologies in a hardware environment allow to test our system in real-time implementation There are a couple of DSP based platforms that can be selected for validation from Lyrtech Inc the Small Form Factor SFF Software Communication Architecture SCA Development the Small Form Factor SFF Softwaredefined Radio SDR Development Platform the Small Form Factor SFF Software-defined Radio SDR Evaluation Module 20 All these platforms are based on TMS320DM6446 DMP SoC from Texas Instruments 21 For the proposed SDR based system we chose the SFFSDR Evaluation board see Figure 13 as far as this platform supports WiMAX technology model based design tools accelerating prototyping implementation of all protocols layers for complete radio stacking extra boards operates with 297MHz ARM926EJ-s RISC CPU and 594MHz C64x DSP in sense of power management this module has MSP430 MCU Due to an availability of Virtex-4 SX35 FPGA from Xilinx 22 this module can perform implementation of full modem processing functions that is very important feature in meaning of multi-protocol architecture of our system We are able to vary our requirements to each protocol inside the same hardware structure Figure 13 SFF SDR development platform by Lyrtech 6 PROTOTYPING THE WiMAX/UMTS SYSTEM The WiMAX/UMTS system is implemented in high-level language as C with the class library The main accent was done on the correct form of the signal processing sequence The path for WiMAX or UMTS signal is determined in the beginning and system should verify its entity leads the system in a relevant direction The main goal of this software implementation is to check how our system can handle the input signal sequence The simulation was carried out for following parameters for each subsystem For UMTS we consider transport block with 1280 bits size frame size is 2400 bits channelization code with 16 chips sequence For WiMAX we generate the bit block is equal to 1280 bits however during channel coding operation this block is divided on turbo coding block that include 384 bits The size of turbo coding block forms from the block determination corresponding modulation type and number of subchannels During software verification we obtained that our proposed model can separate different paths subject to a type of an inter sequence in the software environment The framework of our WiMAX/UMTS system went through one scenario step and now we are directed to an extension of this model For the more detailed system visualization we integrate our C code modules into MATLAB library by means of proper dynamic linking libraries dll compiled by using the MATLAB C compiler Each block can be formed with extended parameters Modules with C code configurate the system work in a host This host implementation will present a prototype This prototype will help to analyze future real-time hardware implementation MATLAB prototype can also provide debugging of real system the result of real system must be equal to our MATLAB prototype Next step of the work development and verification is to implement it into the hardware platform based on DSP DSP based platform allows to organize signal processing in a digital presentation that serves SDR based part of our general system 7 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we considered the framework of WiMAX/UMTS baseband level system for mobile device in UL transmission direction We presented the different signal processing structures based on OFDM and WCDMA physical layer procedures Our research work is mainly devoted to developing the approach of seamless switching between different subsystems that can be realized by SDR technology implementation To this end we proposed a possible solution to allow coexistence of different data transmission technologies 11
