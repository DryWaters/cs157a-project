is the most commody-used sampling scheme nonuniform schemes are seldom studied it is common knowledge that they exhibit inferior performance and are too bizarre to consider seriously In this paper how ever we show that such schemes may have been discarded prematurely a nonuniform sampling can have its bene fits Specifically the nonuniform and uniform sampling schemes are compared for two kind of trackers the PDAF which updates its track based on a single scan of informa tion at a time 
and N-D assignment an optimization based implementation of the MHT in which the sliding window involves many scans of observations We show that given the ground rule of maintenance of the same overall scan rate i.e the same sensor effort uniform sampling is always optimal for the single-scan tracker in the sense of track life However a nonuniform sampling can outperform uniform sampling if a more sophisticated multi-scan tracker is used particularly when i the tar get has a

for a linear system from measurements corrupted by Gaussian observation noise The optimal in essentially every sense solution in this case is the Kalman flter However in target tracking the obfuscation in the measurement sys tem previously modeled only as the introduction of an additive Gaussian observation disturbance now addition ally incorporates measurement-origin uncertainty That is there can be false alarms and also the true i.e target-generated measurement may be missed Conse quently the measurement scan delivered from the 
sensor to the tracking subsystem can be null detection missed and no false alarms single perhaps true but also may be a false-alarm with the true measurement missed or multiple true measurement if present at all is not la beled as such amongst those delivered The key tracking issues are hence how to determine which measurement if any is true and how to reflect the resulting uncertainty in the tracker's self-assessment Many sensor systems operate autonomously and deliver their measurement scans on 
a ed-interval basis  most sonar systems work this way as do conventional rota tor radars Some electronically steered radar systems however allow for the tracking user to request scans of data on an adaptive or at least an agile basis Inter estingly, Daum in 4 has suggested that sampling times and possibly jittered versions of these ought to be con sidered as parameters in the optimization of tracking sys tems Notwithstanding it appears that most tracking de signers 
remain more comfortable with the original regular delivery of scans irregular scans are an unwanted extra dimension of freedom and it is easiest to ignore it In this paper we explore the more general case of nonuni form sampling Suppose we have a uniform sampling in terval T The kind of nonuniform sampling considered here is that the system samples at interval TI and T2 al ternatively but to make the overall sampling rate equal 4-1597 


and to have a fair comparison we must have Tl T2  2T To be concrete we may consider that a periodic-scan sys tem can request measurements each second T  1 and that an alternative but comparable in terms of radar re source cost scheme requests a pair of scans separated by 0.1 seconds with each pair separated by 1.9 seconds TI  0.1 and T2  1.9  see Figure 1 for an illustration The timing just discussed and that to be explored in this paper is the result of a deliberate staggering of measure ment sampling times  basically this is an option for a radar resource management system. But there is another sort of nonuniform sampling that is not deliberate that arising from data fusion from asynchronous sensors Con sider Figure 2 in which centralized processing is amm plished based on measurements from a pair of autonomous observers These observers do not scan in lock-step and the arrival of a measurement from either at the fusion center is aperiodic and could even be considered in the general case\a point-arrival random process see Figure 3\(a We do not consider explicitly the data fusion situation here there are simply too many variables to adjust for a clear picture to emerge Similarly, even in the single sensor case with sensor management we could consider more-sophisticated staggered-sampling schemes such as in Figure 3\(b This paper is exploratory whatever behav iors are to be found in these more-involved cases the sim pler situation of Figure 1 should hint at them That is the situation we study here is we hope a proxy for other cases and if some advantages of a nonuniform sampling should arise here  then perhaps it is worthwhile to exam ine other cases So is there some benefit to nonuniform sampling As is widely known false alarms can be assumed to be uniformly distributed in the surveillance region and to be independent of the true observation 1][2 Under this as sumption the sampling interval scheme is irrelevant to the false alarm process However since it is generated by the target the true observation is affected by the sampling interval As can be easily shown, when the sampling inter val is short the true observations from two time-adjacent samples are close to each other Thus the true observa tion can be made more distinguishable from those that are false by use of a short sampling interval two mea surements in adjacent scans that are very close are likely both true while any measurement in a fist scan that is not repeated by one in the second scan that corroborates it is probably false This is illustrated in Figure 4 Thus, notionally the nonuniform sampling scheme ought to be an excellent means to combat measurement-origin uncertainty However there is a price the longer sam pling interval between the two scan pairs 1.9 seconds in the above increases the uncertainty the gate and the resulting increase in false alarm may actually exacer bate measurement/target association This is illustrated in Figure 5  note that the increase in gate size can mean an increase in the number of false alarm that could be confused with the true measurement and this may result in a lost track In this paper, these two sampling schemes are compared It will turn out that the superiority of one versus another is very much ii function not only of parameters. but also of the tracking scheme used Specifically we shall investi gate the probabilistic data association filter PDAF and N-D assignment algorithms 2][5][6][7 The PDAF asso ciates measurements to tracks one scan at a time and hence that it will be shown that uniform sampling is al ways the best approach for the PDAF is perhaps unsur prising However when a tracker that makes use of more than one scan of past data is used i.e multidimensional assignment the system with nonuniform sampling can outperform the conventional uniform one The advan tage becomes most obvious when the target maneuvers more when the clutter average number of false alarms is high and when the probability of detection is close to unity 2 System Model of Single Target Here we focus on the l-dimensional Discretized Continu ous White Noise Acceleration model DCWNA l The alternative is to assume the Discrete White Noise Accel eration model DWNA and although which is chosen is often a matter of taste \(both are based on reasonable sta tistical assumptions but since these assumptions are not necessarily satisfied by a real target one tends to choose one's favorite\one more commonly sees DWNA since its parameters art slightly easier to relate to real-world ef fects Under DWNA the model is directly in the discrete-time domain and is tantamount to a continuous-time kine matic object undergoing a constant acceleration during each interval between observations under DCWNA the model is of discretetime samples a continuous-time sys tem driven by continuous-time white noise Normally there is little clifference but here, since we wish to com pare different sampling schemes of the same target it mat ters a lot DWNA is inappropriate and we use DCWNA A CWNA object moving in a coordinate  is modeled as i'\(t  qt 1 where E[C\(t  0 E[.ii\(t T  qqt  7 As they do 4-1598

sampling interval the true observation which is close to the predicted value of the measurement has fewer 223com petitors\222\222 false alarms in its likelihood function evalua tion This can explaii in part why nonuniform sampling is a good idea with assignment 5 Numerica I Resu Its In the simulations of both the PDAF and the N-D assign ment algorithm we use the one dimensional target model described in Section 2 5.1 The PDAF Uniform Sampling Is Better Nonuniform sampling is compared to uniform sampling in Figure 8 a representative result for the PDAF in which for the nonuniform case we have TI  0.1 and T2  1.9 seconds as compared to the uniform-sampling case\222s T  1 second The plot shows average track life in seconds Apparently the difference between nonuniform and uni form dwindles as the number of false alarms increases we shall soon see that this is also the case for a multi frame tracker But the clearest conclusion is that for the PDAF and presumably for any frame-by-frame tracker a uniform sampling rate is better Figure 8 depicts only one set of parameters but we have been unable to fu?d a case in which its conclusion is contradicted 5.2 Assignment Weird Sampling Can Be Preferable Figure 9 shows the behavior of a threescan assignment algorithm the percentage of tracks lost in 200 seconds is plotted and as in Figure 8 we have T1  0.1 and T2  1.9 seconds as compared to the uniform-sampling case\222s T  1 second As with the PDAF the nonuniform sampling performance improves relatively speaking as the clutter density increases However and unlike Figure 8 nonuniform sampling is actually preferable to uniform provided there are enough false alarms This is ampued in Figure 10 which shows the percent age of lost tracks as a function of the ratio Tl/T2 with of course the stipulation T1  T2  2 seconds in all cases It is clear from this that when pairs of samples are close i.e a small ratio there can be a si@cant improvement from a nonuniform approach The difference can be substantial a factor of two when the ratio approaches zero inter estingly this is the 223data fusion\224 case discussed earlier Figure 10 is particularly kid to nonuniformity because it depicts the case of perfect detection there are false alarms but no measurements are missed Figure 11 ex plores this further Apparently the improvement for the nonuniform sampling case is greatest when the tar get is faithfully present in the data we shall discuss this in the next section Generally though we have found that nonuniform sampling is preferable only when PD  80  90 For the discretized continuous-time white noise accelera tion model of Section 2 the maneuvering index dehed T3 A 0 in which T refers to the uniform inter-sampling time provides a convenient scalar measure of a target\221s elusive ness Figure 12 plots the percentage of lost tracks against A and reveals that any benefits of nonuniform sampling are magnified by a more-maneuvering target in l as 2 6 Discussion It has been asserted that uniform sampling is always preferable to nonuniform when the tracking algorithm as sociates measurements to targets on a scan-by-scan basis as with a PDAF However and on the contrary if asso ciation is based on several scans\222 worth of measurements then nonuniform sampling actually has something to offer This is especially true when the probabfity of detection is high when the clutter is high and when the target\221s maneuvering indm is high Now this study of nonuniform sampling was motivated by the idea that data association might be helped by a cross-chd between returns from two contiguous scans of observations Presumably this is indeed a beneficial ef fect However association is hampered by false-alarms and the number of these can be thought of as propor tional to the size of the association 224gate\223 surrounding each measurement\221s predicted location and inside which candidate associations are sought This gate has volume itself proportional to the innovations\222 covariance S actu ally the square root of its determinant and is hence a quadratic polpomial of the time between scans Presum ably then this favors a uniform sampling The point is that these two effects are in anflict and it is difFicult to tell at the outset which wiU dominate In fact we cannot even envision proofs of the earlier observations given the complexity of the tracking task However the tendencies observed e.g high PD is best for nonuniform are reasonable and in the following sections we shall try to explain why We shall begin with a study of the Kalman flter and in particular its average gate size 6.1 The Kalman Filter Case Underlying most trackiig systems is the Kalman flter the tracker that would be optimal were there no measurement origin uncertain Above it is argued that the perfor mance of a tracki system is degraded by a larger gate size since the greater the gate the more false alarms can enter Prediction of the gate size is difficult but in the simplistic Kalman flter situation it can be done For the usual Kalman flter the steady-state gate size is straightforward to estimate from the discrete time Ric 4-1601 


cati equation l Here however the gate size varies due to the irregular sampling times During the longer inter-sampling interval the gate will increase more than it would have increased during a uniform sampling time but of course it begins from a smaller uncertainty due to the prior short sampling interval The question is which effect wins Let us consider the model of Section 2 but to incorporate uneven sampling we shall stack the state for consecutive pairs of scans Specifically let us write with reference to S and its sequel r\(\(k  1 Tl  T2  T2 I 23 in which z is a stacked vector of position and velocity where Q1 and Q2 are from 12 Solution of the dis crete algebraic Riocati equation with the above parame ters yields prediction uncertainties when estimation is in steady state the 1,l element is required for the gate volume for the T1 interval and the same procedure with TI and T2 interchanged goes toward the T\222-interval\222s gate volume In Figure 13 the average gate volume averaged over long and short intervals is plotted as a function of the ra tio Tl/\(T1  T2 We see that this average is actually greatest for the uniform sampling case and least for the 222data fusion\224 scenario We also observe that the benefit from nonuniform sampling increases as the target exhibits greater manmverabfity a corroboration of the observa tions in Figure 11 6.2 The Case With Data Association As discussed earlier analytic results with data associa tion are sparse However there is a recent development of some interest a Cramer-Rao lower bound \(CRLB has been developed for single-target tracking As given in lo this CRLB has elements of the Riccati equation although the parameters are modified somewhat by an 223informa tion reduction factor\224 that reduces measurement fidelity as a function of the uncertainty in provenance Now the CRLB shows the accuracy of an optimal MAP estimator The truly MAP estimator never loses track regardless of the harshness of the tracking scenario as such we cannot expect any corroboration of the 223track-length\224 behavior of a practical tracker such as the PDAF or hard-assignment However the CRLB does provide a measure of the curva ture of the log-likelihood function near the true data and is in that regard a rekement of the Kalman filter results in that data axiociation is accounted for Example results are shown in Figure 14 which plots the CRLB after both long and short-interval predictions as a function of clutter density Perhaps of greatest interest here is that the short-interval uncertainty is sign%cantly less than that when uniform sampling is used and that even for the longer interval the inflation in this quantity is not huge That is the less-comprehensive but more exact analysis for the Kalman filter does seem to apply We also show in Figure 15 the corresponding results obtained from simulation and assignment trackers  qualitatively Figures 14 and 15 are very similar 6.3 Multi-Scan Tracker Results Our contention at the outset was that if one was pre sented with two measurements relatively close in time, one could crosschock detections in one with those in the other and thereby eliminate from serious consideration many false alarms The disadvantage from doing this however is the lengthened time between such pairs of samples when one assumes a constant average sensor resource budget the uncertainty gate grows and more false alarms enter the picture However it appears that a multi-scan tracker can see some benefits from nonuniform sampling in the situations listed below High Maneuvering Index This is not immediately apparent However the Kalman filter analysis does indicate that it will be so A more-maneuvering tar get engenders a more quickly increasing gate which magnifies effects High False Alarm Density Similar to target maneu ver a greater clutter density magnifies any effects from a small or a large gate High Probability of Detection Any possible benefit from the proposed 223cross-che&\224 is lost if the true observation is not detected frequently or is not ex pected to do so The ikst two cmnsiderations are tantamount to the target being difficult to track whereas the last a high Po indi cates an easier tracking task  usually heavy clutter and high maneuvering index go with low Po although both clutter and PI can be adjusted together by the detection threshold The reason that a high probability of detec tion is necess,ary to observe the benefits of nonuniform sampling is that if a measurement is not repeated in suc ceding scans at a lower Po then it may be either a miss or clutter but if Po is suf3iciently high the overwhelming likelihood is for the latter 6.4 Single-Scan Tracker Results The PDAF and presumably other scan-by-scan data association algorithms such as JPDAF or 2-D assign 4-1602 


ment cannot by dehition realize any benefit from non uniform sampling's cross-validation between scan pairs As to whether the they are hindered by an increase in average gate size the Kalman filter and CRLB analysis suggest that this ought not be so However both these analyses are quite idealized in the former there is no data association the PDAF must associate false alarms and missed detections and in the latter estimation is op timal based on all received data the PDAF is certainly not that It turns out that the PDAF's imperfections dominate 7 Conc I usion In this paper nonuniform sampling and uniform sampling schemes are compared in different trackers PDAF and N-D assignment In some situations such as when data comes from a rotating radar it is moot to discuss the benefits from or drawbadis to a nonuniform data-taking structure But in some situations a non-uniform struc ture is imposed an example of this is data fusion in which measurements arrive from asynchronous sensors One tends to treat this as an unavoidable evil but is it really that bad In fact it can be beneficial This indicates perhaps that intelligent sensor-resource man agement systems ought to consider deliberate staggering sampling times We have explored only the simplest case of non uniformity that in which measurements arrive in pairs separated by a short interval we take this as a proxy for more complicated situations It has been shown that for the PDAF uniform sampling is always best However when the tracker utilizes more than one scan of data from the past  as with multipleframe assignment or presum ably the multi-hypothesis tracker MHT  nonuniform can outperform uniform sampling This is particularly so when 0 the target is highly maneuverable and/or 0 the false alarm density is hi and/or 0 the probability of detection is high In the above, we speak in terms of percentage of lost tracks and of average track lifetime and in all cases the aggregate sensor resource is kept constant meaning for example that one non-uniform scheme with short interval 0.1 sec ond and long interval 1.9 seconds can be fairly compared to a uniform scheme in which the constant inter-sample interval is 1 second Further and in all situations, nonuniform sampling yields a significant reduction in MSE in the short sampling inter val than does uniform sampling at the expense of course of a larger 1LISE after the long interval This is not sur prising but it does indicate that if a tracking estimate is to be used for targeting it is a good idea to begin to use staggered samples and to launch after a short-interval sample Acknow I edgment This research has been supported by AFOSR under con tract nunher F49620-97-1-0198 and by ONR under con tract nunher N00014-97-1-0502 References l Y Bar-Shalom X Li and T Kirubarajan Estima tion with Application to Tracking and Navigation Wiley 2001 2 Y Bar-Shalom and X Li Multitarget-Multisensor Tracking Principles and Techniques YBS Publishing 1995 3 Y Bar-Shalom and X Li Stability evaluation and track life of the PDAF for trackii in clutter I E E E Transactions on Automatic Control Vol 36 pp 588-602 May 1991 4 F Daum A System Approach to Multiple Target Trackiig In Multitarget-Multisensor Tracking Appli cations and Advances Volume I I Y Bar-Shalom editor Art House 1996 5 C L Morefield Application of 0-1 Integer Pro gramming to Multi-target Tracking Problems IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control Vol 22 pp 302-312 June 1977 6 K R Pattipati S Deb Y Bar-Shalom and R.B Washburn Passive Multisensor Data Association Using a New Relaxation Algorithm In Multitarget-Multisensor Tracking Advanced Applications Y Bar-Shalom editor Art House 1990 7 K R Pattipati S Deb Y Bar-Shalom and R.B Was&urn A New Relaxation Algorithm and Passive Sensor Data Association IEEE Transactions on Auto matic Control Vol 37\(2 Feb 1992 SI P Smith and G Buechler A Branching Algorithm for Discriminating and Tracking Multiple Objects I E E E Transactions on Automatic Control Vol 20 pp 101-104 Feb 1975 9 P Willett M Alford and V Vannicola The Case for Likesensor PreDetection Fusion I E E E Transac tions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems pp 986-1000 October 1994 lo X Zhang and P Willett Cram&-Rao Bounds for Discrete-Time Linear Filtering with Measurement Origin Uncertainties Proceedings of the Workshop on Estima tion Tracking and Fusion A Tribute to Yaakov Bar Shalom Monterey, CA May 2001 4-1603
