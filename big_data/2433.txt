INTRODUCTION \nLessons learnt from globalization and the changes \ncaused by the recent financial crisis make it clear that \ninnovative and flexible methods are necessary for European \nmanufacturing industries to compete in continually \nchanging environments [1]. Communication and exchange \nof information is no longer an instrument for process control \nbut a key driver of business performance. In fact, in the \nrecent years, inter-enterprise collaboration through intense \ndata sharing has become essential for the success of nmanufacturing enterprises, especially for small and medium-\nsize companies.  \nFurthermore, the adoption of mobile devices to support \nmanufacturing industry in their business processes is \nwitnessing an unprecedented speed, according to IDC \nexperts [2]. Mobile applications help to fully exploit the \nadvantages of on-site working in real-time and quick \ndecision making between various stakeholders, and \ntherefore lead to increased productivity and quality of \nmanufacturing processes [3]. Indeed, especially \ngeographically distributed collaboration and remote access \nto information and data through mobile devices are key \ndrivers for increased efficiency, improved cost control and a \nlower carbon footprint. \nThe explosion of the Semantic Web in the recent years \n[4] has provided the opportunity to develop advanced \ntechnology enablers to support new inter-organizational \ncollaboration models. However, although Web 3.0 \ntechnologies have been successfully adopted in many \nenvironments, such as e-Government or e-Commerce, \nmanufacturing companies still remain quite reluctant to \npublishing their information in a Linked Data cloud, due to \nthe absence of fine-grained security solutions that would \nassure the complete protection of their information from \nunauthorized access from individuals or companies. Indeed, \nmobile collaboration through the Web of Data between \npartner companies or between a company and its customers \nis a challenge that requires overcoming various security nproblems in order to achieve satisfactory results.  \nTo overcome the aforementioned limitations industry is nworking on the definition of the technology enablers to \nprovide an inter-organizational mobile collaboration space \nthrough a Linked Data cloud turning today’s organization-\ncentric manufacturing approach into a product-centric one. \nManufacturers will benefit from a flexible, efficient \nplatform that helps them to operate as one virtual factory \nand hence gain competitive advantages in their markets.  \nHowever, the realization of such product-centric \ncollaboration space poses significant challenges in terms of \nproviding the right security controls to ensure effective \nmobile access control management to distributed linked ninformation data sources that create the specific product-\ncentric information spaces shared by the enterprises engaged \nin collaboration. Traditional access control models are not \nparticularly well suited to meet the major security \nchallenges that product-centric information spaces raise. \nThey do not facilitate a fine-grained access control model \nfor the Web of Data, provide a limited support to mobile \noperations and do not deliver a common access control \nframework to the heterogeneous data sources including \ntransient data and traditional binary resources and \ndocuments. \nThe goal of this paper is to describe the current progress \nin designing a security model which will enable mobile \nagile inter-organization collaboration in the Semantic Web \n \n \n978-1-4673-5828-6/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE \naddressing the limitations of more tradition\npaper will discuss and present an enhanc\nsecurity access control approach whic\ntraditional XACML role-based multi-doma\nmodels with innovative SPARQL q\ncapabilities based on data views to addr\nneeds of mobile inter-organizational info\nwith support for linked data information\ncoming from Internet of Things \(IoT s\nThe remainder of this paper is organ\nSection 2 states the background and need fo\nalso providing an overview on research r\ncontrol and protecting the semantic web.

In some cases, there are even legal \nconstraints on the accessibility of strategic information nbetween different parts of the same enterprise. \nIt is essential that access control should be supported at a nfine granularity \(i.e., RDF minimum information entity \nwhich is the tuple or triple coarse-grained \nlevel \(i.e., repository level  Jena [15]. \nTherefore, the only sensible solution to promote secure \nand trusted collaboration through Linked Data is to develop \na fine-grained access control mechanism that grants access \njust to concrete parts of the stored information taking into \naccount the group the user belongs to. \nC. Related Work \nAs addressed by Ferraiolo and Kuhn [16], the access \ncontrol model designed to secure the mobile collaboration \nthrough the 


Web of Data will be role based, that is, the role \nof users will be determinant to know if a user is authorized or \nnot to access a particular subset of information within the \nLinked Data cloud.  \nHowever, some other user attributes will be considered \nwithin the suggested security approach to take a decision n\(permit/deny company department, \nproject, etc where the \nuser comes from. For that purpose, the defined access control \nmodel will also take some inspiration from Kuhn’s proposal \n[17], which combines a role based access control model with \nan attribute based access control model. \nBut so as to address a collaboration network based on \nLinked Data and the Semantic Web, the use of role and \nattribute based access control models is not enough and the \ndefined access control approach should also focus on Web \n3.0 technologies. In fact, the Semantic Aware Access \nControl SABAC  Semantic Web Technologies. This paper proposes to use \nSAML \(Security Assertion Markup Language nauthentication and authorization assertions. As it will be later \nexplained in this paper, the proposed security approach will \nuse SAML assertions for authentication as proposed by \nShen. Apart from that, this paper proposes the use of \nXACML standard for better interoperability and \nadministration. This XACML standard will, in fact, be used \nin the proposed access control model as a way of defining \nand managing detailed access control policies when dealing \nwith transient sensor data, when the access to the data \nlocation should be controlled instead of to the RDF \ninformation itself.  However, this SABAC approach does not \naddress an inter-domain access control, i.e. it does not focus \non securing collaboration networks between different ndomains.  \nShen and Cheng [19] propose a context-based access \ncontrol model using Semantic Web technologies where \npolicies are expressed using SWRL. Yet, they do not apply \ntheir model to the Web of Data, nor to collaborative \nenvironments. \nMoreover, the designed access control model will also \nbenefit from the organization’s accumulated experience as \naddressed by Gunter [20]. It becomes essential to learn from \nthe previous accesses and to have records from events such \nas successful access events or denied permissions. In order to \naddress these issues, the access control model suggested will \nstore the records of every access request as well as the \nsubsequent decision taken in an access control log. Later on, \na traceability manager will analyze the information stored in \nthe access control logs, in order to determine if any user has \ntried to perform a malicious access, to obtain access \nprobabilities and statistics, etc. Hence, as addressed by nGunter, by repeating this process iteratively, the access \ncontrol model will be progressively improved. \nIn 21], the authors discuss the importance that protecting \ndata does not only mean granting full access or not but in \ncertain instances fine-grained access control mechanisms are \nrequired to restrict pieces of information. The Linked Data \ninfrastructure currently lacks mechanisms for creating fine-\ngrained privacy preferences that define which data can be \naccessed by whom. This might discourage enterprises from npublishing sensitive data as RDF in the Linked Data cloud. \nTherefore, the proposed mobile access control framework \nwill enable to create these fine grained access control \npolicies to access the RDF information published in Linked \nData. \nFurthermore, in the last few years, with the proliferation \nof RDF repositories some propositions have emerged \nregarding access control models for Linked Data. In [10] a \nset of actions that can be performed on an RDF store are \nencompassed. Several operations for updating the store and \ntwo operations for querying the store are defined. The \nsecurity policy consists of permissions or prohibitions to nperform actions on some RDF triples. Enforcement of the \nsecurity policy \(for query actions filtering out \nunauthorized triples from the result set. In [22] the authors \nassign security labels to RDF triples. So as to limit \nunauthorized inferences, they consider the entailment rules \nand recommendations defined in the W3C RDF Semantics \n[23] and propose some rules for automatically assigning \nsecurity labels to involved RDF statements. Both models \npropose an algorithm to rewrite a given query into a secure \nquery according to the security policy. Nevertheless, both \nhave the same drawback: they are not efficient since they \nrequire to instantiate the graph patterns used in the security \npolicy. Apart from that, none of these models include an \nadministration model specifying how the security policy can \nbe updated. In fact, both of them assume that the definition \nof the security policy should be carried out by a central \nauthority. This is really a problem in the context of the \nInternet of Things or even the Web, where metadata come \nfrom different sources and should be managed in a \ndecentralized way. \nBesides, the authors in [24] present a Privacy Preference \nOntology \(PPO asks for a particular \nRDF file and the system selects and returns the accessible \npart of the requested file Costabello et al. [25] present a \nLinked Data access control framework focused on context-\n \n n978-1-4673-5828-6/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE \naware control policies for querying Web of Data servers \nfrom mobile environments. Their proposed access control \nframework selects the appropriate access policies to be \nassessed 


and then verifies the set of access conditions \nincluded in the selected policies to grant or not the access nNevertheless, neither of these papers considers the \napplication of their access control models for the Web of \nData to decentralized collaboration environments. \nD. Outline and contributions \nIn this paper, an enhanced multi-domain access control \nframework is suggested, which allows fine-grained policies \nto be defined for dynamically restricting \(or granting and ad-hoc \nmobile collaboration between geographically distributed \nexperts in a decentralized manner, as support to the Internet \nof Things paradigm. \nIn fact, the use of a security framework that will allow ncross-domain authentication by the exchange of security \ntokens across different domains is proposed. Once multi-\ndomain authentication is solved, the defined authorization \napproach investigates a SPARQL query rewriting solution \nbased on the creation of data views in parallel with \ntraditional XACML solutions. The goal of the rewriting step \nis to create a query that returns the same results as the \noriginal query except for those answers that contain \nrestricted information. For this purpose, the security \nframework includes conditions to the original SPARQL \nquery so that all the information requested is included \nwithin the set of information that the user is authorized to \naccess taking into account its role. Since a view represents a ncomprehensive set of semantically related data, it is not \nneeded to include these semantic relationships as conditions \nin the security rules, as it is done in models [10] and [22]. \nMoreover, since several RDF patterns of interest can be \ngrouped into the same view, the number of rules can be \nreduced. Consequently the suggested approach gains in \nreadability and concision. \n \nIII. THE SECURITY FRAMEWORK \nA. Multi-domain mobile environment’s security aspects \nIn order to define a security framework for mobile inter-\ndomain collaboration based on controlling access to Linked \nData, some assumptions have been considered previously n• The security framework designed protects not just the \naccess to information published in the Web of Data nyet, it also takes into account that the enterprises may \nalso have information stored in traditional formats, such \nas binary resources or documents. Furthermore, when \ndealing with manufacturing environments that address \nthe Internet of Things paradigm, it must not be \nforgotten to take into account the live data that may \nchange continuously, such as temperature or pressure \nvalues obtained from sensors and actuators. \n A Circle of Trust \(CoT ndefined for this CoT. This is what is named as common \nglobal roles. The access control proposed must be nbased on the users’ global roles, and not on their \npersonal identity. \n• Each domain \(organization administrate their \nown data and security policies independently. Each \ndomain is responsible for managing its users. It \nmanages the user credentials and authenticates its users. \n• The user applications will store and know the addresses \nof the organizations with whom they collaborate. \nB. General operation and architecture of the security \nframework \nIn a mobile collaborative environment, it normally occurs \nthat a user from a company A \(domain A domain B access control architecture \nintegrated within an example of two different domains \n\(Domain A and B will use the mobile applications \n\(located in the Mobile Application Layer information to all the involved \ndomains. Each domain has a Domain Access Server \(DAS point of access to all data sources of one \ndomain. Thus, all the requests for information of one \ndomain will arrive at the DAS of that domain. The DAS \nhosts the access control systems. \nIn the bottom of the picture the Domain Source Layer is \nlocated, where the different SPARQL endpoints and servers \nare hosted, both the SPARQL endpoints where the semantic \ndata are located and the servers where the live/transient data \nand the resources in traditional format are hosted. \nThe boxes painted in green in Figure 2 are the security \nsystems that will be integrated into the whole collaborative \narchitecture: \n \nFigure 2 Combined AC approach to enable secure mobile collaboration \nthrough the Web of Data \nR\nRR\n \n \n978-1-4673-5828-6/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE \nSo as to being able to perform an access request to the \ninformation in the target domain, first of all, the target ndomain will need to trust the requester. The target domain \nwill not trust the origin domain blindly Administrators \nshould be suspicious about user assignments made in other \ndomains. Global roles must be qualified by the origin \ndomain and the security policies in the target domain have to \ncheck this qualifier This process requires that the target \ndomain trusts the Identity Provider \(IdP fact, as the different domains are just responsible \nof managing their own users, a user from domain A will nhave to authenticate against its own domain and deliver a \nsecurity assertion to domain B so that it can now trust the \nrequester. This process will be explained in detail in the \nAuthentication section \(C Cross Domain Authentication Query Interface and the \nauthorization process starts. The Query Interface receives \nHTTPS requests with embedded SPARQL queries or \nrequests for single dereferenceable URIs. Depending on the \nnature of the 


requested data, different authorization processes \nwill be executed. If the requested data are published in the \nLinked Data cloud as RDF, the SPARQL query rewriting \nprocess will be performed and will provide a SPARQL nrewritten query as a result, which will be launched to the \ncorresponding SPARQL endpoint. However, in those nsituations where live data are demanded, the access will be \nperformed to an URL where the changing RDF information \nis stored instead of to the data itself, that is, the access will be \nto the location of the data, not to the data itself. If the mobile \napplication from the requester domain does not know the \nURL where the live data are located, it should launch a \nSPARQL query to obtain this URL. This SPARQL query \nwill be rewritten and as a result the URL will be obtained. \nOnce the URL where the live data are stored is known a \ntraditional XACML authorization process will happen.  \nC. Cross domain authentication \nThe line of research has been based on SAML [26] \n\(Security Assertion MarkUp Language schema for security assertions \nand protocols to exchange these assertions. SAML allows \nbusiness entities to make assertions regarding the identity, \nattributes and entitlements of a subject to other entities, such \nas a partner company or another enterprise application. An \nassertion contains one or more statements. An attribute \nstatement contains attributes of a user such as roles of this \nuser, in this case, the global role of the user. \nThe components responsible for the authentication \nprocess are the following: \n• Identity Provider \(IdP also works as a STS \(Security Token Service SP element that \nrequires access to information in the target domain, which \nwill contain a Domain Authenticator module. \nThe multi-domain security framework needed in the \ncontext of the Web of Data must be built on SAML identity \nfederation. Each user must authenticate towards the IdP in its \nown domain which must be able to deliver Assertions \ncontaining global roles. This standard will allow \nauthentication messages \(SAML over SOAP IdP SP both located in different \ndomains.  \nAn important characteristic of the current mobile \ncollaboration networks is the use of mobile devices. Most \napplications will run directly on mobiles devices, the \nSPARQL queries are launched from the devices and are \ndirectly sent to the SPARQL endpoints. In such a situation it nis not possible to rely on a web browser to support identity \nfederation. Unlike traditional SAML implementations based \non a client trying to access a SP from a browser, the planned \nsolution is based on ECP Enhanced Client or Proxy – \nprofile defined by OASIS has to \nfollow in order to get a security token to be used so as to get \naccess to a Service Provider in the target domain: \nAs shown in Figure 3, the user application in domain A \n\(user A from now on mobile application, \nlaunches a HTTP request to the SP in domain B \(SP B from \nnow on establishing a connection \(1 credentials to validate its identity are provided, \nSP B requests a security token from user A \(2 then authenticates against its own domain IdP \n\(IdP A from now on nwhich will be seen as a trust guarantee for SP B. Before \ndelivering the identity assertion to User A, IdP A may \nrequest some information from the principal in order to \nauthenticate the user \(3 domain authentication workflow \n \n \n978-1-4673-5828-6/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE \n \nNote that SAML does not specify the implementation of \nthe identity provider service, i.e. it does not define the way to \nauthenticate users so they can use a userID/password or \neven fingerprint or biometrical authentication methods. With \nthe authentication information provided, the IdP A is capable \nof identifying User A \(4 repository with \nall the users belonging to its own domain. The service \nconsumer obtains a SAML attribute assertion \(a security \ntoken 5 containing global roles. \nThe service consumer includes this assertion in the \nSOAP envelope and sends it to the Service Provider \(6 it and extracts the roles of the user A \nfrom the attribute statement. Based on the attribute assertion, \nSP B will take a ‘deny’ or ‘permit’ decision \(7 8 ndecision has been ‘permit’, a trusted connection between \nUser A and SP B is established from this moment on and \neach time a request is sent from User A to SP B, the \ncredentials obtained must be included and provided to SP B. \nThis approach allows any user \(coming from any \ndomain environment,  \nin its own/origin domain and then using trustworthily the \ntoken in a potentially different server-side domain, what is in \naccordance to multi-domain collaborative scenario expected \nin the Internet of Things. \nD. Authorization based on SPARQL query rewriting \nWhile in RBAC, access policies are expressed by nplacing users in groups and assigning rights to groups, in the \nsuggested approach data views are created 


i.e. a set of \ntriples i.e. canSee, canUse groups. This is achieved by \nwriting policies using Notation3 \(N3 will describe rules and/or formulaes. \nThe SPARQL queries are rewritten so as to retrieve just the ninformation associated with the views the requester have \naccess to as a result of being member of one or more groups. \n1 of a Subject, a Predicate and an Object. As the \nauthors in [28] state, the combination of a subject predicate, \nand object element description matches a set of triples in the \nRDF store namely, those triples whose subject matches the \nsubject description, predicate matches the predicate \ndescription and object matches the object description. As a \nresult, these three element descriptions together define a \nview of the RDF store. Indeed, a view is defined as a set of \ntriples, which is the smallest unit that can be protected as \nseen in Figure 4: \n \nFigure 4 Data view example \nThe process proposed is to assign these views to a nconcrete group of users which are the ones who are going to \nbe able to see or use that view. This is going to be specified \nin the domain policies. By default, all the data not associated \nto any view are protected By means of the N3 policies, the \ndifferent views are created and associated to the \ncorresponding user groups. That is, the basic idea is that a \n“user” is member of a “group” which “canSee” or “canUse” \na “View that is composed \(hasTuple Triples establishes \nthat the group ‘cv_managers’ is able to see and use the view \n‘cv_managers_view’. By means of this policy the group \n‘manufacturer_managers’ is also added to the group \n‘cv_managers’. \nlog:implies \n ins:cv_managers_view a ac:View. ins:cv_managers a \nfoaf:Group; ac:canSee ins:cv_managers_view; ac:canUse nins:cv_managers_view }. \n \n@forAll ins:x. \n{ ins:manufacturer_managers rdfs:member ins:x } \nlog:implies \n ins:cv_managers a foaf:Group; rdfs:member ins:x }. \n \n@forAll ins:x, ins:y, ins:z, ins:n, ins:v, ins:t. \n ins:x voc:configParam ins:y. \n  ins:y foaf:name ins:n. \n  ins:y voc:value ins:v. \n  ins:y voc:timestamp ins:t nlog:implies \n{ ins:cv_managers_view ac:hasTuple [ a ac:Tuple; ac:subject ins:x; \nac:predicate voc:configParam; ac:object ins:y ]. \nins:cv_managers_view ac:hasTuple  [a ac:Tuple; ac:subject \nins:y ac:predicate foaf:name; ac:object ins:n ]. \nins:cv_managers_view ac:hasTuple  [a ac:Tuple; ac:subject \nins:y ac:predicate voc:value; ac:object ins:v ]. \nins:cv_managers_view ac:hasTuple  [a ac:Tuple; ac:subject \nins:y ac:predicate voc:timestamp; ac:object ins:t ] \nFigure 5 Domain policy example \nSo, if it is desired that a concrete group of users can \naccess \(see or use If that view already exists, that group \nshould be added as a new member of the groups that are able \nto see or use that view. \nViews will be created inferring new facts and importing \nthem into the RDF data store. As a result of this process, a \nnew set of RDF data with the facts inferred and organized in \nviews will be created and published replacing the original \nRDF data. \n \n \n \n978-1-4673-5828-6/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE \n2 Queries rewritting \nSince January 2008, SPARQL is the W3C recommended \nlanguage to query RDF data. SPARQL can be used to \nexpress queries across diverse data sources, whether the data \nare stored natively as RDF or viewed as RDF via \nmiddleware.  \nThe rewriting process consists on adding control checks \nto the received SPARQL query so that the resulting query \nwill just work with the information related to the roles that \nthe requester belongs to. \nThose checks added by the rewriting algorithm defined \nare composed by triple patterns and constraints. During \nquery resolution, the added triple patterns and constraints \nwill limit the access to the information that has been \nassociated to any view related to the groups of the requester. \nTake the following example in Figure 6.

Thus, a result tuple to this query \ndiscloses the values of ‘n’, ‘v’ and ‘t’. \nAfter applying the rewriting algorithm, the resulting \nSPARQL query rewritten is the one shown in Figure 7: \nPREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1 nPREFIX ins: <http://www.comvantage.eu/instances#> \nPREFIX ac: <http://www.comvantage.eu/ac-schema#> \nPREFIX voc: <http://www.comvantage.eu/vocabulary#> \nSELECT ?n ?v ?t \nWHERE { \n ins:machine132 voc:configParam ?p . \n http://www.comvantage.eu/ac-\nschema/groups#cv_managers> ac:canUse ?v_0 . \n ?v_0 ac:hasTuple ?t_0 . \n ?t_0 ac:subject ins:machine132 . \n ?t_0 ac:predicate voc:configParam . \n ?t_0 ac:object ?p \n?p foaf:name ?n . \n http://www.comvantage.eu/ac-\nschema/groups#cv_operators> ac:canSee ?v_1 . \n ?v_1 ac:hasTuple ?t_1 . \n ?t_1 ac:subject ?p . \n ?t_1 ac:predicate foaf:name . \n ?t_1 ac:object ?n . \n?p voc:value ?v . \n

For each view ?v that \napplies to a group ‘g’, its internal nodes will be bound \n\(subject, predicate, object nIt is important to note that the rewriting process is \nindependent from the policies defined, i.e. the same nconditions are always added regardless of the policies. In \nfact, the defined rewriting algorithm does not need to see the \nset of configured policies. \n3 to verify the efficiency and performance of the \nquery rewriting algorithm and the application of the policies nin terms of processing load and time, the following test has \nbeen performed: without query rewriting there were 42.199 \nstatements and, as a result of applying a query rewriting \nprocess, 212.532 statements were obtained, which is five \ntimes larger.  \nTaking into account the query execution times, it has \nbeen proved that when it takes 109 ms to execute an original \nquery, whereas it would take 697 ms to execute a rewritten nquery.  \nThe tests have been executed by means of Allegro Graph \nRDF Store Web 3.0 Database [29], which is a database and \napplication framework for building Semantic Web \napplications. \nOf course, it can be appreciated that the query rewriting \nprocess involves much more processing time \(six times more \nthan without rewriting but this is not an important issue in \nthe context of the mobile collaboration in manufacturing \nenvironments where these delays do not interfere in the \nordinary operation. The prototype evaluation shows that, \nalthough the overall performance needs to be optimized, the \ndelay introduced by our fine-grained access control is nacceptable given that data protection comes with a cost. \nE. Authorization based on XACML \nThe authorization model presented in the section before, \nbased on the creation of data views and query rewriting, was nappropriate to access information published in the semantic \nweb \(in RDF format solution proposed should not \nforget that companies do not just store information in RDF \n \n n978-1-4673-5828-6/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE \nformat, but they also may host traditional resources such as \nbinary resources, excel sheets or text documents nenvironments, live sensor and actuator data which may be \ncontinuously changing should also be taken into nconsideration. These data are not published in an SPARQL \nendpoint; instead, its location \(its URL accessed but \nnot the RDF data itself.  \nIn these cases, in order to obtain the URL where the data \nare located \(if not previously known nAccess Server to which the data belongs, in order to obtain \nthe URL of the data. After going through the SPARQL query \nrewriting algorithm, the URL will be provided to the mobile \napplication. Once the URL is known a classic HTTPS \nrequest will be launched to the DAS in order to obtain the \ndesired value.  So as to authorize the access to the concrete \nvalues requested, traditional XACML access control \napproach will be implemented. \nFulfilling the needs of distributed architectures, the \nXACML architecture [30] addressed in the proposed security \napproach logically separates the access components \nresponsible for policy definition policy enforcement and \npolicy evaluation. The Policy Enforcer will form a request \nbased on the requester's attributes, the resource in question, \nthe action \(read/write the request \(such as time of the day nwhich will look at the request, find some XACML policy \nthat applies to the request, and come up with an answer about \nwhether the access should be granted. That answer is \nreturned to the Policy Enforcer, which will then allow or \ndeny access to the requester.  \n \nIV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK \nIn this paper it has been defined a new fine-grained \naccess control approach for secure mobile collaboration \nthrough Linked Data in the context of the Web of Data \napplied to manufacturing. In a nutshell, so as to cover all the \nsecurity needs that may arise from this mobile collaboration \nenvironment, a security framework which will combine, on nthe one hand, the creation of data views and SPARQL query \nrewriting algorithms and, on the other traditional XACML \naccess control has been defined. \nThe next step is to develop an integrated prototype based non the presented design. Once the development of the \nprototype has been completed, it will be investigated if the \nmock-up meets the objectives or if further iterations of \ndesign, development and reflection are required. In fact, the \nsecurity model will be refined and improved so far in order \nto extend its scope from a mock-up to a functional prototype.  \nFuture testing campaign will be carried out to provide a \nthorough evaluation with other SPARQL query engines, \nsuch as Virtuoso, Sesame or Jena. \nFuture work includes similarly to the rewriting of \nqueries, the analysis of the query results, whether they \ncontain confidential 


information, that is, to address also a \ncontent-based access control.  \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThe research leading to these results was funded by the \nEuropean Community's Seventh Framework Programme \nunder grant agreement no.

Some are acted upon immedi-\nately, but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions -- our implicit "label-\ning" of the world. In this talk I will describe our work using physiological correlates of this labeling to con-\nstruct a hybrid brain-computer interface \(hBCI record electroencephalographic \(EEG part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate \nthe neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective inter-\nest. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using nsemi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to those that are labelled. \nFinally, the system plots an efficient route so that subjects visit similar objects of interest. We show that by \nexploiting the subjects' implicit labeling, the median search precision is increased from 25% to 97%, and the \nmedian subject need only travel 40% of the distance to see 84% of the objects of interest. We also find that \nthe neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers inference of subjects' \nimplicit labeling. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of ob-\njects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting \nin an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user's interests. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Paul Sajda is Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Radiol-\nogy at Columbia University and Director of the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing \n\(LIINC modeling and \nmachine learning applied to image understanding.

White \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Are Our Cellular Models Fundamentally Wrong? \n \nAbstract: The Hodgkin-Huxley model, arguably the greatest success story in the history \nof computational neuroscience, is the predecessor of thousands of existing cellular models \nthat span a significant range of levels of detail. Here, using electrophysiological, dynamic-\nclamp, and computational techniques, we demonstrate that many of the “gold standard” \nsingle-cell models, used by thousands of laboratories, fail to account correctly for the responses of well-studied \nexcitatory neurons to noise.  In particular, the input-output gain of entorhinal stellate cells and neocortical py-\nramidal cells is substantially less sensitive to noise than predicted by the models.  The major source of the dis-\ncrepancy is that the models fit measured peri-threshold voltage dynamics poorly.  Because noise is ubiquitous \nand prominent in the brain, and because neuronal gain is crucial for understanding a wide range of response nproperties at the cellular and network levels, we argue that this is an issue of fundamental importance. \n nBiographical Sketch:  John A.

Despite spending as little as 0.01% of their lives having seizures, people \nwith epilepsy take antiepileptic drugs \(AEDs ex-\nperience significant AED related side effects, and approximately 1/3 continue to have seizures. Mapping the \nbrain networks generating seizures is critical for successful epilepsy surgery, therapeutic brain stimulation, \nand seizure forecasting. In focal epilepsy the spontaneous, evoked, and induced brain activity is disrupted \nover a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. Multiscale electrophysiology recordings have uncovered a range \nof electrophysiological biomarkers, measurable interictal \(between seizures normal and \npathological tissue that show promise for spatiotemporal mapping of epileptogenic brain.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
