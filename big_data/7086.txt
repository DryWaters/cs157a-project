IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING VOL 65 NO 7 APRIL 1 2017 1909 Unraveling the Rank-One Solution Mystery of Robust MISO Downlink Transmit Optimization A Veriﬁable Sufﬁcient Condition via a New Duality Result Wing-Kin Ma  Fellow IEEE  Jiaxian Pan Anthony Man-Cho So  Member IEEE  and Tsung-Hui Chang  Member IEEE Abstract This paper concentrates on a robust transmit optimization problem for the multiuser multi-input single-output MISO downlink scenario and under inaccurate channel state information CSI This robust problem deals with a general-rank transmit covariance design and follows a safe rate-constrained formulation under spherically bounded CSI uncertainties Curiously simulation results in previous works suggested that the robust problem admits rank-one optimal transmit covariances in most cases Such a numerical 036nding is appealing because transmission with rank-one covariances can be easily realized by single-stream transmit beamforming This gives rise to a fundamentally important question namely whether we can theoretically identify conditions under which the robust problem admits a rank-one solution In this paper we identify one such condition Simply speaking we show that the robust problem is guaranteed to admit a rank-one solution if the CSI uncertainties are not too large and the multiuser channel is not too poorly conditioned To establish the aforementioned condition we develop a novel duality framework through which an intimate relationship between the robust problem and a related maximin problem is revealed Our condition involves only a simple expression with respect to the multiuser channel and other system parameters In particular unlike other suf\036cient rank-one conditions that have appeared in the literature ours is veri\036able The application of our analysis framework to several other CSI uncertainty models is also discussed Index Terms Multiuser MIMO transmit optimization robust optimization semide\036nite

10.1109/TSP.2017.2649488 I I NTRODUCTION I N THE multiuser multi-input multi-output MIMO downlink scenario linear precoding has played a key role in greatly enhancing system throughput and efﬁciency   I n simple terms the idea is to share the channel among multiple users simultaneously by leveraging on the MIMO degrees of freedom Linear precoding achieves this by transmitting linearly superimposed multiuser signals whose mutual interference or multiuser interference at the user side has been pre-managed by the base station However linear precoding also requires the base station to have access to the channel state information CSI of the users most preferably perfect for otherwise it would be difﬁcult to perform precise interference control While it has been demonstrated in the literature e.g the above referenced articles that linear precoding can boost the per-user and overall achievable rates drastically in the perfect CSI regime it is also well known that existing systems often do not acquire CSI perfectly owing to a variety of practical and operational reasons This practical constraint has stimulated a b ranch of research that aims to establish linear precoder design or transmit optimization frameworks that are robust against CSI uncertainties   It would not be easy to have a complete overview on the present developments of robust multiuser MIMO transmit optimization The reason is that existing works may use different system settings and their technical developments usually have much dependence on the latter Particularly a study can differ in terms of i the chosen quality-of-service QoS measure for the users e.g achievable rate signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio or symbol mean squared error ii structural assumptions on the linear precoder e.g general linear precoding with arbitraryrank transmit covariances or transmit beamforming with a xed number of data streams iii the design criterion e.g the QoSconstrained formulation or the sum-rate maximizing formulation Despite such diversity we can classify existing works into three types according to the robust performance metric The rst is the worst-case approach wherein the CSI uncertainties are seen as bounded deterministic unknowns e.g within a sphere and the robust performance metric is the worst-case QoS with respect to w.r.t the CSI uncertainties This leads to a transmit solution that is safe in the worst-case sense In this context the design criteria usually give rise to robust optimization problems with semi-inﬁnite constraints The current state of the art focuses mainly on the conic optimization framework where techniques originated from robust optimization are 1053-587X  2017 IEEE Personal use is permitted but republication/redistribution requires IEEE permission See

1910 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING VOL 65 NO 7 APRIL 1 2017 applied to convert those semi-inﬁnite constraints into convex linear matrix inequalities Note that the conversion is sometimes equivalent and sometimes approximate as a r estriction  13  14 or a r elaxation  10  11 t hat generally depends on the chosen QoS The second type of robust techniques is the average approach wherein the CSI uncertainties are modeled as random variables and the average QoS w.r.t the CSI uncertainties is used as the robust performance metric This average approach may lead to higher throughput than the worst-case approach in an average sense although one should also note that average robust performance measures may not be as desirable for real-time or delay-sensitive trafﬁc The corresponding design criteria lead to stochastic optimization problems which present a different challenge some recent results can be found in  16 T he third type is the outage-based approach wherein the performance metric is a QoS level under which the actual QoS will be satisﬁed with high probability again assuming that the CSI uncertainties are random It is a safe approach but in a probabilistic sense and with the level of pessimism being tunable Outage-based designs deal with chance-constrained optimization problems that are intrinsically very hard to solve Recent developments tackle this issue through efﬁciently computable approximations  I t i s i nteresting t o note t hat the w orstcase approach upon appropriate modiﬁcations can also be used to handle the outage-based designs see e.g  A Focus of this Paper and Contribution In this paper we focus on a particular robust transmit optimization problem in the multiuser multi-input single-output MISO downlink scenario Speciﬁcally the performance metric is the worst-case achievable rate under a spherically bounded CSI uncertainty model and under general linear precoding The design criterion is that of minimizing the total transmission power subject to the constraint that the worst-case achievable rate of each user is better than or equal to a pre-speciﬁed rate value The same problem was rst studied in in the conte x t of semideﬁnite relaxation SDR transmit beamforming and extended later to other scenarios such as cognitive radio networks  d istrib uted multicell coordination  23 and outagebased robust designs I n particular  t he problem can be converted to a semideﬁnite program SDP which can be efﬁciently solved by conic optimization algorithms Empirically it has been observed that this robust problem exhibits a very desirable behavior namely the optimal transmit covariances of the multiuser signals were found to be of rank one in most of the instances  11  20 W e s hould s tress t hat the design criterion does not impose any rank constraints on the transmit covariances and numerical results suggested that rank-one optimal transmit covariances is generally the case This phenomenon is practically important since in rank-one instances the physicallayer transmit strategy reduces to per-user single-stream transmit beamforming which is simple to deploy in practice The contribution of this paper is fundamental We set out to prove when the robust transmit optimization problem described above admits a rank-one solution From a communication theory viewpoint our motivation is similar to that in some classical MIMO study such as the single-user average robust study in where t he objecti v e i s t o understand when the s imple single-stream transmit beamforming scheme is the optimal physical-layer transmit scheme Moreover from a mathematical optimization perspective this rank-one solution analysis problem is closely related to the study of rank reduction theory in SDP which is important as evidenced in recent works   Before we describe our approach let us mention some related work Under the same system setting rank-one solution analyses in the perfect CSI case have been considered and in fact solved in 30 T he pro v able r ank-one results therein a re strong and requires little assumption However the main tools used in the perfect CSI case such as the SDP rank reduction technique turn out to be not too useful in the inaccurate CSI case this will be discussed in the next section In that regard we are faced with a new analysis challenge Recently several independent studies have attempted to solve the robust rank-one solution analysis problem  by identifying v a rious suf cient conditions for the robust problem to admit a rank-one solution Unfortunately these sufﬁcient conditions are not veriﬁable in the sense that they either depend on some quantity that cannot be determined in closed form or require certain assumptions whose satisﬁability has not been further proven Thus it is not easy to extract physical meanings from those results As an additional minor note the robust problem is shown to have strong rank-one solution guarantees in certain restrictive cases namely when there is only one user  34 o r w hen there a re at most tw o t ransmit antennas In this work we prove a veriﬁable sufﬁcient condition for the robust rank-one solution analysis problem Roughly speaking we show that if the magnitudes of the CSI uncertainties are small compared to those of the corresponding channels and if the channels of different users are not too similar in terms of direction then the robust problem will admit a rank-one solution The aforementioned condition sounds practically reasonable since large CSI uncertainties and similar channel directions tend to result in infeasibility of the robust problem or a poor solution in terms of power efﬁciency Our analysis is based on a novel duality result proven herein speciﬁcally for the robust problem This duality result allows us to tackle the robust rank-one solution analysis question by studying the rank-one solution conditions of the same problem under perfect CSI which is an arguably easier task The duality result also provides fundamentally new insights into the robust problem as we will explain in the paper B Organization and Notations In Section II we give the background of the robust transmit optimization problem of interest This will also include simulation results and a concise review of some known rank-one solution results In Section III we describe our main rank-one result This is followed by Section IV which provides the proof of the main result Section V discusses how the main result can be applied to several other CSI uncertainty models Section VI concludes the paper The notations used in this paper are mostly standard and some speciﬁc notations are deﬁned as follows H n is the set of all complex-valued Hermitian n  n matrices

comparison the related constraint function 004 i  W  h i  in 2 is indeﬁnite quadratic in h i givena general W 010S  Let W 006 denote the optimal solution to 22 throughout the proof we will assume this without further mentioning Then it can be seen from Problem 22 that W 006 is a feasible solution to min W 010S K 002 i 1 Tr W i  s  t 012 i  W  H i  012 0 i 1 K 24 for any given H  H 1  H K  010V 005

deﬁne p  H   min W 010S K 002 i 1 Tr W i  s  t 012 i  W  H i  012 0 i 1 K Since p  H  012 002 K i 1 Tr W 006 i  v 006 for any H 010V wehave v 006 004 p 006 005 sup H 010V p  H   We now develop the following key result Proposition 2 Suppose that Problem 22 has an optimal solution and that 002 2 i  0 for all i  The following two properties hold 1 The optimal value p 006 is attained i.e there exists an H 006 010 V such that p 006  p  H 006   2 Suppose that v 006  p 006 holds and let H 006 be an optimal solution to sup H 010V p  H   Then the optimal solution W 006 to Problem 22 must be an optimal solution to Problem 24 for H  H 006  Proof of Proposition 2 We will show that p  H  is upper semicontinuous on V  Let us assume this for the time being By noting that V is compact we see that p 006 sup H 010V p  H  is attained by some H 010V  This establishes the rst property For the second property suppose that v 006  p 006 but W 006 is not optimal for Problem 24 when H  H 006  Then we have p 006  p  H 006   002 i Tr W 006 i  v 006  p 006  a contradiction It remains to establish the upper semicontinuity of p  H  on V  The main tools we need are summarized as follows Fact 5 Let E  F be 036nite-dimensional Euclidean spaces a cf 51 Proposition 1 Let I be an arbitrary index set and X\021E be arbitrary Suppose that f i  X\022  007  007  is upper semicontinuous at  x 010X for all i 010 I  Then f inf i 010I f i is upper semicontinuous at  x  b cf 51 Corollary Let X\021E be arbitrary and Y\021F be compact Suppose that f  X◊Y\022  007  007  is upper semicontinuous at all points in   x Y  Then the function g  X\022  007  007  de\036ned by g  x up y 010Y f  x  y  is upper semicontinuous at  x  Since Fact 2 implies that Problem 24 attains zero duality gap for any H 010V note also the feasibility of Problem 24 for any H 010V and 002 2 i  0 for all i  we can use the dual form in 13 to equivalently express p  H  as p  H sup  004 0 inf Z 010S g  H    Z   for any H 010V  25 where Z  Z 1  Z K  010 H N  H N  S is given in 23 and g  H    Z  K 011 i 1 002 2 i  i  K 011 i 1 Tr 017 Z i 017 I  002 j 011  i  j H j   i 005 i H i 020\020  Additionally since p  H  012 v 006  007 and 002 2 i  0 for all i it can be readily veriﬁed from 13 that any optimal solution  to the outer problem in 25 is bounded Thus without loss of generality we may assume the existence of an M 0 such that p  H  sup 0 012  012 M 1 inf Z 010S g  H    Z   for any H 010V  where 1 denotes an all-one vector We are now ready to apply Fact 5 Let R n  denote the set of nonnegative numbers in R n  Since g is continuous and hence upper semicontinuous at any  H    010V R K   Fact 5\(a implies that  g  H   nf Z 010S g  H    Z  is upper semicontinuous at any  H    010V R K   Subsequently by applying Fact 5\(b p  H up 0 012  012 M 1  g  H    is upper semicontinuous at any H 010V  The proof is therefore complete 003 Proposition 3 Suppose that Problem 22 has an optimal solution and that 002 2 i  0 for all i  It holds that v 006  p 006  The proof of Proposition 3 is similar to that of a duality result in robust optimization 52 Th 4 3 and is given as follows Proof of Proposition 3 Proposition 3 is a consequence of the following simpliﬁed version of Sion’s minimax theorem Fact 6 Sionís Minimax Theorem  54 Let X  Y be subsets of a 036nite-dimensional Euclidean space and f      be a real-valued function on X◊Y If 1 X is convex and compact Y is convex 2 f    y  is lower semicontinuous and convex for each y 010 Y  and 3 f  x    is upper semicontinuous and concave for each x 010X  3 The result

1920 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING VOL 65 NO 7 APRIL 1 2017 guaranteed to admit a rank-one solution if the optimal solution to the xed-channel rate-constrained problem in 29 must be of rank one for any H 010V Let  V i   H i  h i h H i  003 i  003 i 002 0  h i 010 C N  005 h i   h i 005 2 2 Tr 003 i  012 013 max  C i    It is easy to see that V i 023  V i  Furthermore from the part-two proof it is immediate that 41 implies that the optimal solution to Problem 29 must be of rank one for any H 010  V 1   V K  Consequently 41 also implies the same rank-one result for any H 010V  and the proof is complete 003 B A Modi\036ed Spherically Bounded Model for FDD Consider a specialized model for limited channel feedback in the FDD system I n t his conte x t each user i is preassigned a channel direction codebook C i   v i 1  v i,L   where every codebook element v i,l satisﬁes 005 v i,l 005 2 1 and L is the codebook size The user estimates the channel h i and feeds back two quantities to the base station namely the channel norm 005 h i 005 2 and the codebook-quantized channel direction  v i  arg max v 010C i  h H i v   005 h i 005 2  Consequently the presumed channel is  h i  005 h i 005 2   v i  If we assume that the channel direction quantization is the dominant source of error then we may model the channel error e i  h i   h i as 005  h i  e i 005 2  005  h i 005 2  005 e i 005 2 005  h i 005 2 012 016 where 016 0 describes a bound on the channel direction quantization error The corresponding channel set U i is U i   h i 010 C N 005 h i   h i 005 2 012 016 005  h i 005 2  005 h i 005 2  005  h i 005 2   42 For the above model an extended form of the S lemma can be established to deal with the corresponding robust rateconstrained problem W ith the e xtended S lemma we have the same development as in Section II-B Again our interest here lies in the rank-one condition Corollary 3 Consider Problem 2 under the channel sets in 42 The rank-one result in Theorem 1 holds if 8 is replaced by 005  002 k  h k 005 2 2 016 2  1 K  021 K  1 K 022 005 k k 1 K 43 where  h i   h i  005  h i 005 2  and  002 i is the orthogonal complement projector of   h 1   h i  1   h i 1   h K   We should note that  h i in the above corollary is the channel direction and following the aforementioned system model  h i lies in the codebook viz  h i   v i 010C i  Corollary 3 suggests that if the chosen codebook elements  v i among different users are not too similar and if the codebook resolution is high so that 016 is small then the rank-one condition can be achieved Also unlike the result for the spherically bounded model the rankone condition in 43 does not depend on the channel magnitude 005  h i 005 2 2  The proof of Corollary 3 is omitted for brevity since it is similar to and in fact fundamentally no different from the proof of Theorem 1 Simply speaking we utilize the fact that the channel set U i in 42 is spherically bounded and apply the same argument as in our previous proof to obtain the rank-one result In the proof the only point that needs some attention is to show that the SDR representation of the robust constraints in Problem 22 is tight i.e max h i 010U i 012 i  W  h i   max H i 010V i 004 i  W  H i   where V i is the semideﬁnite-relaxed counterpart of U i in 42 Since U i in 42 is deﬁned by two quadratic constraints it can be veriﬁed using Fact 4 that the above equality holds C The Box Bounded Model Now let us consider the box bounded model U i   h i 010 C N 005 h i   h i 005 007 012 016 i   44 where the channel error is modeled as being elementwisebounded by some given 016 i  0  This model may be useful when the channel is scalar-quantized and fed back to the base station In this case the SDR representation of the robust constraints is no longer tight i.e we only have max h i 010U i 004 i  W  h i  012 max H i 010V i 012 i  W  H i   where V i   H i 010 H N  H i 002 h i h H i  h i 010 C N   H i  jj  2Re   h i  024 j  h i  j     h i  j  2 012 016 2 i j 1 N   in general However Problem 22 recapitulated here as min W 010S K 002 i 1 Tr W i  45a s  t  max H i 010V i 012 i  W  H i  012 0 i 1 K 45b is still useful as a safe approximation i.e any feasible solution to Problem 45 is also feasible for the original problem 2 Like the previous cases Problem 45 can be efﬁciently solved By considering the dual of the problem on the LHS of 45b and exploiting zero duality gap it can be shown that the constraints in 45b are equivalent to t i 004 0  012 Q i  Diag t i  r i r H i s i  016 2 i 1 T t i 013 002 0 i 1 K where as before we have Q i  1 005 i W i  002 j 011  i W j  r i  Q i  h i  s i   h H i Q i  h i  002 2 i  Hence Problem 45 can be rewritten as an SDP and once again its solution can be efﬁciently computed via conic optimization software The rank-one result for the box bounded model is as follows Corollary 4 Consider Problem 45 which is a safe approximation of Problem 2 under the channel sets in 44 The

MA et al  UNRAVELING THE RANK-ONE SOLUTION MYSTERY OF ROBUST MISO DOWNLINK TRANSMIT OPTIMIZATION 1921 VI C ONCLUSION In this paper we provided a rank-one solution analysis for a robust multiuser MISO transmit optimization problem Our result suggested that under some practically reasonable condition the robust problem is guaranteed to admit a rank-one solution Our analysis is based on a novel duality framework developed in this paper The duality result reveals that the robust problem has a strong connection to another problem that takes a maximin form and through that connection we identiﬁed a sufﬁcient condition under which the robust problem must have rank-one solutions We also discussed how the duality result can be applied to several other robust problems that use different channel error models As a future direction it would be interesting to investigate how the duality result can be extended to deal with a wider class of robust transmit optimization problems such as the outage-based robust problems  and the multicell p roblems A PPENDIX A Proof of 9 Let  h i   h i  005  h i 005 2 Wehave 005  002 k  h k 005 2  005  h k 005 2 005  002 k  h k 005 2  005  h k 005 2  min x 010 C K  1 005  F  k x   h k 005 2 025\005  h k 005 2  min y 010 C K y K   1 005  Fy 005 2 004\005  h k 005 2  min 005 y 005 2 1 005  Fy 005 2  Since min 005 y 005 2 1 005  Fy 005 2  002 min   F  for tall or square  F we obtain 9 B Proof of Proposition 1 Let E k denote the event that the k th inequality of 8 is violated i.e 005  002 k  h k 005 2 2 003 2 k 012 1 K  021 K  1 K 022 005 k  Also let E  026 K k 1 E k  which is the event that the sufﬁcient rank-one condition 8 in Theorem 1 is violated Our problem is to prove an upper bound on Pr E   By the union bound we have Pr E  012 K 011 k 1 Pr E k   46 Let us focus on Pr E k   Under the Gaussian distribution assumption in Proposition 1 it can be shown that 005  002 k  h k 005 2 2  007 k 2 U 2 N  K 1  where U d denotes a standard chi-square random variable with d degrees of freedom see 56 Ch 8 Moreo v e r  it is kno wn that Pr U d 012 014d  012 034 014e 1  014 035 d 2  for any 014 010 0  1  see e.g 27 Proposition A Using t he abo v e tw o r esults we get Pr E k r 021 U 2 N  K 1 012 2 003 2 k 007 k 027 1 K  K  1 K  005 k 030 022 Pr 021 U 2 N  K 1 012 2 N  K 1 010 k CUR k 022 012 021 010 k CUR k e 1  010 k CUR k 022 N  K 1  for 010 k CUR k  1  By plugging the above inequality into 46 and using e 1  014 012 e for any 014 010 0  1  we obtain the desired result C Proof of Proposition 4 The proof is by construction Recall the notation  F    h 1   h K   Throughout the proof we shall assume that  F H  F  I N 004 K 47a 002 2 1    002 2 K 005 002 2 005 1    005 K 005 005 47b 003 1    003 K 005 003 1  47c The proof is divided into four steps In Step 1 we determine a condition on 005 003 under which Problem 2 has an optimal solution In Steps 2–3 we prove bounds on the LHS and RHS of 28 respectively In Step 4 we combine the results in the previous steps and identify a case where 28 has strict inequality for a particular setting of N K 005 003  Step 1 We show that Problem 2 has an optimal solution if 005 1 K  1 021 1 003  1 022 2  48 Suppose that Problem 2 has a feasible solution  W  Since the optimal value v 006 of Problem 2 satisﬁes v 006 012 002 i Tr  W i   007  we can write v 006 inf W 010S 002 i Tr W i  s  t  2c  002 i Tr W i  012 R where R 007 satisﬁes 002 i Tr  W i  R  Since the above problem has a continuous objective function and a compact constraint set the optimal value v 006 is attained Our next question is when Problem 2 is feasible Let W i  011  h i  h H i i 1 K

satisﬁed Hence we have identiﬁed instances of  N K 005 003  for which v 006 d 006  We should also verify that the instances constructed above satisfy v 006  007  In Step 1 we showed that Problem 2 has
