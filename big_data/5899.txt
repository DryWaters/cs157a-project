Memory Requirements Evaluation For evaluating the memory requirements of three algorithms, the experiments focus on two aspects 1 We verify the memory requirements of tree construction among three algorithms with different minimum supports in T10I4D100K database. The result is shown in Fig. 11 As shown in Fig. 11, the results are not influenced by different minimum supports because theses algorithms are minimum support value independent. Nevertheless, for constructing T10I4D100K data set, CATS tree spent 15,654KB 


GC tree spent 19,881KB, and SC tree only spent 13,030KB SC tree algorithm saves about 17% and 34% than CATS tree and GC tree Then, we evaluate the influences of different transaction sizes with a fixed minimum support 0.4%. As shown in Fig. 12 we can find that the average constructing space for SC tree saves about 16% and 34% than CATS tree and GC tree 2 In this part, we focus on memory requirements of mining process. Three algorithms will be verified with different minimum support under 500K transactions and different transaction sizes under fixed minimum support 0.2%. The results are shown in Fig. 13 and Fig. 14 Obviously, the average mining space for SC tree is less than both CATS tree and GC tree 0 5000 10000 15000 20000 25000 0.20% 0.30% 0.40% 0.50% 0.60 Minimum Support M em or y Sp ac e K B CATS Tree GC Tree SC Tree Figure 11.

CONCLUSION AND FURTURE WORKS In this paper, a new tree structure called SC tree and a mining algorithm for association rule are proposed. Advantages of several algorithms are combined in this algorithm, and experimental results also show that the proposed algorithm outperforms CATS tree and GC tree mining algorithms For the SC tree algorithm, the mining model \(tree structure does not need to be re-constructed while the minimum support is changed. This property enables users to adjust the minimum support dynamically to find out satisfied large itemsets Because the database is sorted before mining, the SC tree can be mined only from the bottom-up direction, which is quite different from the bi-directional mining in CATS tree and thus the mining time for SC tree is shorter than CATS tree Moreover, the arrangement of sorted transactions is consistent so it is unnecessary for SC tree to adjust the tree structure as in CATS tree. That further improves the efficiency of tree construction in SC tree In addition, the memory requirements for constructing and mining the tree structure of SC tree are also less than both the CATS tree algorithm and the GC tree algorithm. Experimental results show that SC tree algorithm saves 16%~ 34% of memory space Although SC tree algorithm is more efficient than the other approaches, there are still some aspects can be considered for further improvement. One is the process of pre-sorting. When 


the data set is updated, the whole database has to be re-sorted If only partial tree structure rather than the whole tree structure is to be adjusted, execution time can be reduced substantially Another aspect is the scalability. When applying the SC tree algorithm in a large database, employing the technique of parallel and distributed computing can not only lightens the loading of processers and the requirement memory space but also suits for the architecture of disturbed computing environment in enterprises REFFERENCE 1] Peng, Y., Kou, G., Shi, Y., and Chen, Z., A Descriptive Framework for the Field of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery , International Journal of Information Technology and Decision Making, Vol. 7, Issue: 4, Page 639 - 682, 2008 2] R.

As can be seen, in general, TOP-MATA shows a better performance than TOP-DATA. And as the increase of the ? value, the advantage tends to be even more impressive for these four data sets 4.3. The Computation Saving of TOP-MATA As can be seen in the Tab. 4, four data sets, enjoy signi?cant computation savings brought by TOP-MATA. We can conclude that the computation saving is a major factor for the performance of TOP-MATA. That is, compared with TOP-DATA, a higher computation saving implies a much better performance of TOP-MATA. Since this saving is more signi?cant as the increase of the items, TOP-MATA works better for large scale data sets with a large number of items 5. Conclusion In this paper, we studied the problem of searching for top? item pairs with the highest cosine values among all item pairs. Speci?cally, we provided a novel algorithm TOPMATA which employ a Max-First traversal strategy for ef?ciently performing top-? cosine similarity search. Extensive experimental results veri?ed the effectiveness of the algorithms, And TOP-MATA algorithm is superior to TOPDATA for large-scale data sets with multiple items Acknowledgment This research was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China \(NSFC No. 70901002 and the Ph.D. Programs Foundation of Ministry of Education of China \(No. 20091102120014
