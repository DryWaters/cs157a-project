Big Data Challenges A Program Optimization Perspective 
Arun Kejariwal Big Data is characterized by the increasing volume of the order of zetabytes and velocity of data generation  1   2   3   4   5   6  It is projected that the mark et size of Big Data shall climb up to 53.7 billion by 2017 from the current market size of 5.1 billion  7  Big Data in conjunction with emerging applications such as RMS applications  8   
9   10  and others  11  has so wn the seeds of e xascale computing In a similar vein in  12  Se xton ar gued that applications from domains such as materials science energy environment and life sciences will require exascale computing Recent studies directed towards challenges in building exascale systems and charting the roadmap of exascale computing  13   14  conjecture that e xascale systems w ould support 10to 100-way concurrency per core and hundreds of cores per die In  15  HPC Advisory Council predicts that the rst exaîop system will be built between 2018Ö2020 I E 
XPLOITING M ULTI M ANY C ORES Recent research efforts towards the above include the Intelês 48-core Single Cloud Computer SCC  16  and the Intel s 80-core Teraîop Research Chip  17  A step to w ards supporting higher concurrency is evidenced by Intelês Knights Ferry platform based on the MIC Many Integrated Core architecture  18  which has 32 in-order cores at up to 1.2 GHz with 4 threads per core At International Supercomputing 2010 Skaugen announced a scale-out to 50-cores  19  Current multi-core offerings include Westmere-EX has six-eight-ten cores from Intel and AMDês 16-core Interlagos Several parallel programming models and languages 
have been proposed to exploit the available hardware parallelism on such systems The following lists the mainstream offerings to exploit parallelism at various levels of abstraction such as thread-level task-level and data-level parallelism

Fortress  35  Inspite of large scale efforts in development of new parallel programming models and programming languages there are challenges galore that need to be addressed Speciìcally  Customer facing applications such as Google Search Netîixês video streaming 36  are subject to the latenc y vs throughput trade-off In 37  it w as reported that number of tweets per day are over 250M Likewise there is a deluge of data being posted on Facebook e.g in  38  it w as reported that around 6 billion photos 
are uploaded on Facebook every month Searching the ever increasing amounts of data in real time is highly challenging 
Multi-tenancy Memory management 
003 003 
 In recent years a number of cloud providers have sprung such as Amazonês AWS  39  Microsoft s Azure  40  Rackspace  41  Cloud F oundry  42  These cloud of ferings ha v e a multi-tenant ar chitecture Owing to this resource availability driven dynamic program optimization becomes paramount so as to meet the SLAs service level agreements  Owing to stringent performance requirements applications at Netîix often al 
locate tens of gigabytes to the heap This makes the application performance highly sensitive to tuning of the garbage collector 
Load balancing Support for Data Partitioning 
003 003 
 Increasing number of cores and number of threads per core call for an explicit support for dynamic load balancing  As mentioned earlier the recently announced Intelês MIC architecture  18  has a 8M L2 cache partitioned across 32 cores Explicit support for data partitioning would assist exploitation of data afìnity on a per thread basis To this end Partitioned Global Address Space PGAS parallel programming model has been proposed which forms the basis for languages such as X10 Chapel and Fortress

stolen CPU 
 This is reasoned at  74  as follo ws Adrian Cockcroft architect at Netîix explained the implications of as follows  75  Figure 6 illustrates variation in stolen CPU over 3 day period on one of the production nodes at Netîix Akin to CPU memory pressure also varies over time owing to multitenancy This has direct implications on meeting SLAs Further the incoming trafìc varies over time  Figure 7 illustrates the variation in trafìc over a period of 1 day for one of Netîixês applications Last but not the least delivering personalized user experience 5  as exempliìed by Netîix Recommendations  78  and Amazon.com Recommendations  79  e xacts compute pressure o wing to computation intensive nature of the underlying algorithms such as collaborative ltering  80  and matrix f actorization  81  The above altogether commands for dynamic application optimization so as to deliver best user experience on a continuous basis Over the last decade a large number of techniques have been proposed for dynamic optimization have been proposed  82   83   84   85  In  86  Ber gin and Murphy proposed a framework to improve the run-time performance of component-based enterprise applications via dynamic proìling and dynamic bytecode adaptation In the context of Java the Hot Spot Virtual Machine supports a large set of dynamic optimizations In Java 7 the following 5 Personalization boosts user satisfaction thereby increasing retention which in turn is key for business  76   77  
Figure 6 Illustration of stolen CPU in a multi-tenant scenario Figure 7 Illustration of variation in load in production Figure 8 Illustration of variation in heap usage on a node in production of the run queue Thus an applicationês performance may suffer as CPU may not be allocated to its VM inspite of the VM being in a runnable state Stoeln CPU can often result in a discrepancy between metrics reported by Amazonês CloudWatch  73  4 and operating system utilities such as

Stolen CPU means how many cycles were re-claimed by the hypervisor because the virtual machine has reached the maximum allocated number of processor units of the underlying processor core For example let an instance be allocated 0.4 processor units A 40 CPU busy corresponds the percentage usage of the underlying core However because 40 is the maximum CPU share that can be allocated to this VM the effective CPU usage is 40%/40  100 One performance statistic that is very valuable to Netîix is stolen time Essentially the steal time cycle counts the amount of time that your VM is ready to run but could not run due to other VMs competing for the CPU This is a particularly relevant statistic to think about when you are using a cloud service provider With cloud service providers you do not control the hypervisor as an enterprise customer would in a traditional datacenter As a result you do not know how much the hypervisor is oversubscribed nor do you have insight or control into the amount of resources that other VMs are taking from your compute requirements

performance optimizations were introduced  87  Optimizations such as were evaluated and adopted for production for some of the Netîix applications There exists a large body of work on garbage collection GC a comprehensive bibliography on garbage collection is available at  88  Recently  se v eral GC techniques addressing concurrency and scalability have been proposed  89   90   91  In a similar v ein a multitude of techniques have been proposed for automatic adaptive heap sizing  92   93  Existing dynamic optimizations employ code specialization/versioning to enable for example but not limited to runtime parallelization and runtime SIMDization The optimizations learn from program executions corresponding to different inputs However these optimizations are oblivious of systemic state For example as mentioned earlier in this section available CPU may vary in a multi-tenant environment Thus in the cloud context advanced dynamic optimizations need to developed which can learn from the systemic state For instance let us consider Figure 8 which shows variation in heap usage during a 12 hr window for a Netîix application From the gure we note that the heap usage varies signiìcantly This can in part be ascribed to variation in incoming trafìc over time there are few users streaming video at night Learning the allocation elasticity  94   a measure of ho w the number of GCs changes when the heap size changes  can potentially help guide setting up of autoscaling  95  policies on the cloud IV C ONCLUSION In  64  Satish et al sho wed that for throughput computing applications there is a large performance gap between existing software and best optimized code on modern multimany core processors In this paper we presented a program optimization perspective to the challenges posed by Big Data Speciìcally we discussed exploiting multi/many cores exploiting wide SIMD and the role of dynamic optimization in the context of Big Data and cloud-based architectures R EFERENCES  R E Bryant R H Katz and E D Lazo wska Big-Data Computing Creating revolutionary breakthroughs in commerce science and society Dec 2008 http://cra.org/ccc/docs/init/Big Data.pdf   Challenges and Opportunities with Big Data  http://cra.org/ccc/docs init/bigdatawhitepaper.pdf   Dro wning in numbers Digital data will ood the planetand help us understand it better 2011 http://www.economist.com/blogs dailychart/2011/11/big-data-0   Federal Go v ernment Big Data Rollout  2012 http://www.nsf.gov news/news videos.jsp?cntn id=123607&media id=72174&org=NSF   J Man yika M Chui B Bro wn J Bughin R Dobbs C Roxburgh and A H Byers Big data The next frontier for innovation competition and productivity May 2011 http://www.mckinsey.com/Insights/MGI/Research/Technology and Innovation/Big data The next frontier for innovation   S Lohr  The Age of Big Data  Feb  2012 http://www.nytimes com/2012/02/12/sunday-review/big-datas-impact-in-the-world.html pagewanted=all   Big Data Mark et Size and V endor Re v enues  http://wikibon.org wiki/v/Big Data Market Size and Vendor Revenues   P  Dube y  A Platform 2015 Model Recognition Mining and Synthesis Moves Computers to the Era of Tera Feb 2005 ftp://download.intel.com/technology/computing/archinnov platform2015/download/RMS.pdf   B Liang Compute-intensi v e highly parallel applications and uses

is also displayed in Figure 5 Dominant color means the color with the highest value of the 11 basic colors The same is true of dominant emotion The user selects the feature that seems to be important from these charts in order to analyze it in detail In this example the user selects the feature blue Feature details The system then shows in the form of a graph details for the features selected by the user The graph shows the distribution of the selected features in terms of increase and decrease points It also shows a breakdown by dominant regenerated objects for the change points with the 200 highest values the bluest objects in this example Thumbnails of the points corresponding to each object are also shown These charts reveal that blue is the most signicant color because of the weather reports indicating that the viewers were highly interested in such reports In addition to these charts the system shows lists of points with thumbnails and related information sorted by the feature value see the list of changes points in Figure 5 The system also provides more detail for each point in the form of a ratings graph along with the program guide information Refiltering with interactive feedback We can interactively add or change lters to discover additional patterns In the example shown in Figure 5 the object corresponding to weather reports ID  85 can be ltered out by adding a lter for object features This lter lets us analyze popular new topics after removing the noise from the weather report In this way numerous patterns of audience behavior can be discovered by combining various types of ltering with interactive feedback Figures 6 and 7 show examples of questions that can be asked to obtain knowledge from TV ratings data using our framework The rst three questions Q1ñQ3 shown in Figure 6 represent an analysis for nding a particular pattern of a ratings increase for a specic categoryóhere the categories were news dramas and variety shows In addition to the program category lter we used the lters that extract transitions made during a CF to focus on peopleís interest in the program content For the news program Figure 6a we found that weather reports and sports news were popular For dramas Figure 6b scores for black and dominance computed from the brightness and saturation were the highest The example thumbnails indicate that scenes where the screen is heavily dark tend to be serious scenes during which viewers usually stay on that channel For variety shows Figure 6c we found that high entropy and amusement tend to increase TV ratings The example thumbnails indicate that lively scenes match the needs of people watching variety shows The difference in user behavior for variety shows versus dramas becomes clear when comparing the visualizations produced by our system In contrast to Q1ñQ3 for our fourth question Q4 focuses on the decrease points see Figure 7a Because the initial statistics suggest that thereís a correlation between the color brown and decrease points we selected brown and found that people tended to switch the channels during news commentary and live televised broadcasts of parliament ary proceedings On the basis of the results we ltered out objects corresponding to news commentary and parliamentary proceedings to analyze other factors After ltering black seemed the most signicant feature By selecting and further analyzing this color feature we found that live broadcasts in the dark are also correlated with a ratings decrease For Q5 we tested whether animals inuence ratings see Figure 7b We rst compared the distribution of the scores for an animal between the increase and decrease points for certain categories and found that a difference was observed especially for variety shows To discover more about how an animal can contribute to TV ratings we used an animal lter with a threshold score of 0.3 Analyzing decrease points revealed that animals do indeed seem to inuence ratings except for animals in water For Q6 we targeted a specic event the ooding of the Kinugawa River to learn how viewers behaved following that event We searched for the target event by combining the following lters month program category and keywords The increase and decrease points revealed that people tended to watch live broadcasts and turn to other channels when live event coverage ends News Event Detection and Analysis We developed an application to detect news stories of interest by analyzing the set of change points in news programs We use increase points observed in two categoriesónews and informational programsówhich reect viewers interest in news stories In addition to nding popular IEEE MultiMedia 50 


news topics our analysis revealed other valuable knowledge For example by comparing broadcasting times and ratings increases we could analyze whether the intention of TV stations matched the interests of viewers In addition analyzing audience behaviors when watching news about a disaster can help broadcasters and others determine how best to disseminate information regarding disaster preparedness to maximize who sees retains and acts on such information We detect news stories by analyzing keywords that co-occur with increase points We rst construct a graph from change points with each node corresponding to an increase point We can nd clusters that consist of multiple change points by mining the graph The clusters that contain the most increase points correspond to the news stories of most interest The details of the detection algorithms are described elsewhere 5 To evaluate whether our method could detect important news stories we used the top 10 news stories in Japan for 2015 as reported by the Yomiuri newspaper as the ground truth Table 3 shows the correspondence between the ground truth and our top 10 detected results The CP column shows the rank based on the number of change points in each detected news story This result shows our method detected ve of the 10 ground truth stories The Yomiuri rankings shows the big news stories in general while our rankings shows the news that viewers were most interested in because many people switch channels to a specic news story at the change point Our results revealed that viewers tended to switch the channel to negative news stories such as those about a murder or disaster to proactively collect more information about the specic news stories However viewers didnít actively switch the channels to positive news stories such as those covering a Nobel Prize aware or the Rugby World Cup the viewers instead passively watched the stories Table 3 also shows the accumulated airtime of each news story The murder cases that were ranked in our results but not ranked by the      Q1: In what type of news are people interested Q2: What makes audiences watch drama Q3: What is the key indicator to increase ratings for variety shows  A: People are interested in weather reports and sports news  A: People tend to stay on a channel in serious scenes when the screen becomes dark  A: People want lively scenes with high entropy in variety shows Blue Black Entropy Amusement Dominance Weather  report Green Sports news Filter  news Filter  drama Filter  variey Filter  news, remove object \(85 Remove weather report a b c Figure 6 Examples of analyzing user behavior using the proposed mining system to detect an increase in ratings for a specific category These examples answer questions about a news b drama and c variety shows AprilñJune 2017 51 


Yomiuri newspaper the Osaka Kawasaki and Wakayama murder cases were ranked highly in airtime while the important news stories that were not detected by our method such as the launch of Hokuriku Shinkansen also received much airtime This indicates that TV stations broadcast important news stories equally to some extent regardless of peopleís level of interest while news stories of public interest receive more airtime We also analyzed how the information related to a disaster is broadcast and viewed We compared the three disasters the ooding of the Kinugawa River on 10 September 2015 Figure 8a the Great East Japan Earthquake on 11 March 2011 Figure 8b and the Great Hanshin/Awaji Earthquake on 10 January 1995 Figure 8c We extracted the broadcasting time for each disaster with appropriate keywords and compared the three disasters using airtime and ratings within the broadcasting time Figure 8 shows the accumulated airtime per day and the highest per-minute rating in a day within broadcasting time for each of the three disasters Airtime is indicative of the TV stations intent while we used the highest per-minute rating to show what percentage of people watched news about the disaster that day This result shows that the ooding of the Kinugawa received the most airtime Figure 8a and many people watched the broadcast 26 percent which is signicantly high in Japan On the other hand the Great Hanshin Earthquake which occurred 20 years earlier was not as widely broadcast and thus had lower ratings Figure 8c Although ratings for the Great East Japan Earthquake which happened four years before the Kinugawa ooding are not as significant as for the ooding on that particular day 11 March 2011 TV stations spent a lot of time broadcasting the disaster and nearly 20 percent of potential viewers were watching Moreover this event occurred between two holidays which also might have been a contributing factor in terms of the number of people watching This suggests the intention of   Q4: When do people switch the channel in news programs Q5: Do animals inﬂuence ratings Q6: How did the audience behave when the Kinugawa River ﬂooded  A: People tend to switch channels during news commentary, parliamentary proceedings, and live broadcasts in the dark  A: Animals inﬂuence ratings, especially for variety shows, except for animals in water  A: People tended to watch live broadcasts and switch the channel when the scene changed Brown Distribution of animal scores for each program category News Blue Gray Example of increase points Example of decrease Information Drama Variety Black Blue Filter  news Filter  news reject object \(18, 82, 67 Filter  animal>0.3 Filter  news+information keyword \(Kinugawa Remove some objects a b c Figure 7 Examples of analyzing user behavior using the proposed mining system to a detect a rating decrease for news programs b determine whether animals contribute to ratings and c detect audience behavior related to an event IEEE MultiMedia 52
