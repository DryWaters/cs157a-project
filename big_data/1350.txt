Intelligent Aggregation of Purchase Orders in e-Procurement Guijun Wang Stephen Miller Boeing Phantom Works Seattle WA 98124 USA Email guijun.wang@boeing.com  stephen.a.miller@boeing.com Abstract A large enterprise generates millions of Purchase Orders PO each year buying various types of goods and services Each PO has a cost associated with it This cost comprises multiple elements including the price of the good or service the shipping and handling of the purchase and the overhead in initiating generating tracking and managing the PO To reduce the cost of doing business it is imperative to reduce the total cost of POs in enterprise e-Procurement in an automated fashion One way to reduce enterprise procurement cost is to aggregate demands so that the total cost of a bunch of POs will be reduced by a better price a lowered shipping and handling fee and a reduced overhead The cost of goods and services often depend on several factors including volume timing and other business objectives This paper describes an Intelligent Aggregation approach for automatically aggregating demands to reduce procurement cost in enterprise e-Procurement Our aggregation approach for e-Procurement consists of an information model for representing products goods or services and representing purchase orders for such products a corporate agreement system a negotiation engine and a rule-based aggregation engine The information model is based on an extension of the classic Entity-Relationship model The extension enables association of rules and constraints with and among attributes These rules and constraints must be satisfied during PO aggregation and thus ensure the aggregate PO to be consistent with original individual POs A rule-based aggregation engine examines POs as they arrive and interact with other decision aids to determine whether aggregation of a particular bunch of POs makes any business sense Aggregation can happen in two business scenarios one for POs constrained by existing corporate agreements and another for POs to be refined by online negotiations The aggregation engine interacts with a corporate agreement system to obtain supplier policies in the first scenario For the second scenario it interacts with the negotiation engine to obtain supplier\222s policies during iterations of the negotiation process Relevant policies are those that define product pricing shipping and handing and post-sale services as well as warranties and returns Examples are given to demonstrate how automated intelligent aggregation of purchases is performed and how it reduces cost in enterprise eProcurement 1 Introduction Enterprise supply chain management is a complex process that involves consumers intermediaries and producers E-commerce technologies have much improved efficiency and reduced cost in the supply chain One particular aspect of supply chain management is procurement E-procurements utilize business services connected by the Internet to buy and sell goods and services Buyers intermediaries and sellers exchange electronic Purchase Orders PO in automated eprocurement systems A PO is defined as an electronic representation of a purchase of goods or services at any stage of its lifecycle initiation proposal refinement commitment submission confirmation processing shipping delivery payment and closure On the consumer side a large enterprise buys goods and services on a daily basis and millions of POs are generated each year The total cost of a PO comprises multiple elements including the price of the good or service the shipping and handling of the purchase and the overhead in initiating generating tracking and managing the PO To reduce the cost of doing business it is imperative to reduce the total cost of POs in enterprise procurement in an automated fashion On the supplier side producers of goods and services offer rules agreements and incentives for selling to consumers Business rules may consider types of products volume and timing in pricing Large enterprises of consumers and suppliers may also enter corporate agreements for procurement Corporate agreements allow consumers to receive discounts and guarantees and allow producers to have a steady stream of purchases Intermediaries like transportation and warehousing add value to the supply chain and at the same cost to consumers.ThecostispartofthetotalcostofPOsandis often calculated based on factors like weight distance number of orders number of delivery trips and urgency Proceedings of the 2005 Ninth IEEE International ED OC Enterprise Computing Conference \(EDOC\22205 0-7695-2441-9/05 $20.00 \251 2005  IEEE 


The question is then how to take advantage of the terms and incentives in the rules and agreements in the supply chain to reduce the cost of purchase orders In this paper we describe an Intelligent Aggregation facility for aggregating POs aimed at achieving business goals like cost reduction in enterprise e-procurement This facility can be inserted in enterprise e-Procurement workflow as a value-added service and should work with existing corporate agreements and dynamic negotiation service in procurement e purpose of PO aggregation is to reduce enterprise procurement cost by aggregating the commonality in demands from different organizations in an enterprise and demands over a period of time as well as demands from multiple enterprises in an e-market exchange The remainder of this paper is organized as follows In Section 2 we briefly review related work in this area Section 3 provides an information model for POs PO aggregations can be done in two contexts corporate agreement or dynamic negotiation Section 4 presents elements of corporate agreements and negotiations in enterprise procurement An intelligent aggregation architecture is described in Section 5 We then use some concrete PO examples to show the benefits of intelligent aggregation in Section 6 We conclude the paper by outlining the main ideas of intelligent PO aggregation in enterprise e-Procurement 2 Related Work PO is a central piece of data in enterprise eProcurement Figure 1 shows a generic life cycle of a PO in a typical e-Procurement workflow As shown in the picture a PO goes from buyer\222s enterprise procurement system using enterprise specific process to buyer\222s enterprise gateway broker then to supplier\222s enterprise gateway broker and finally to supplier\222s enterprise systems The gateway brokers on both buyer and supplier sides use the same standard-based process to ensure interoperability Since the gateway broker implements standard processes interactions between business partners are through standard interfaces regardless whether a common multi-party exchange environment is used Depending on procurement policies certain types of purchases may or may not need to go through the Request for Quote RFQ steps before a PO is created The Electronic Business XML ebXML initiative 1 is intended to allow businesses to find each other using a registry define trading partner agreements and exchange XML messages in support of business operations The ebXML standard comprises several families of specifications including business process modeling a registry and discovery mechanism for recording business process and their exchanged messages business and company profiles and a uniform message transport layer for establishing business collaborations and executing business transactions While ebXML s essential in eProcurement our focus in this paper is on intelligent aggregation approach and architecture for POs as a

POs In this paper we propose to use an Entity-Attribute-Relation model extended with constraints and business rules This information model can be easily converted into XML schemas In the following we use an example to illustrate the model Computing equipment such as desktop computers PC is a common type of products an enterprise purchases In this example we assume that each desktop PC has a standard configuration A product representation includes product attributes together with constraints in and between attributes Some of the attributes have fixed values while others are in a range or set of values Information model for Desktop-PC with constraints looks like this Product Desktop-PC Standard Configuration   attributes and constraints on them e Standard-For String Enumeration 205 e

attributes are defined in the information model including corporate agreement that governs the purchase of this product Constraints on attributes and business rules are included to guarantee the integrity of the purchase and the business process Checking business rules requires first checking attribute constraints like deriving purchase price which requires representation and utilization of pricing policies and rules in corporate agreements Note that constraints and rules shown in examples above are inherently associated with products Therefore they are always part of any single purchase order Intelligent aggregation must first ensure that these constraints are satisfied and rules are checked before applying additional aggregation rules to aggregate multiple purchase orders 4 Corporate Agreements and Negotiation Models 4.1 e-Procurement under Corporate Agreement Corporate Agreement CA is a kind of buyersupplier agreements between business partners It is used to govern the business transactions between partners It stipulates the contract and the course of actions between a supplier and a buyer regarding products or services Goals Roles  Policies  Rules  Products  Services and Processes are the key concepts in CA These concepts relate to each other and form a framework to define corporate agreements Abusiness goal is a set of points that a business intends to reach A goal is often expressed in a high level statement e.g stated in the RECITALS part of a corporate agreement To make it a driving force in business activities such as negotiation and aggregation a business goal must be terized in a goal space For example a goal to reduce cost can be parameterized in several dimensions or indexes availability profitability quality maintainability time-to-market profitability and desirefor-relationship etc A goal is a point in the goal space The goal point can be reached by following a set of policies and rules A role is an abstract representation of a set of behaviors For example buyer is a role while Boeing can play as a buyer role Supplier is another role while Dell can play as a supplier role A particular company can play both a buyer role and a supplier role Roles can interact with each other These actions are governed by a set of policies and rules For example a buyer can interact with one or more suppliers and this interaction is governed by rules and policies in buyer-supplier agreements A product is the object that one role e.g buyer agrees to accept e.g purchase from another role e.g supplier subject to conditions and terms e.g rules Similarly a service is the work hat one role e.g supplier performs for another role e.g buyer to perform subject to conditions and terms A process is the sequence of activities that a role has to carry out to achieve an objective Each activity can have triggers defined by events For example in the event of defective product a product return process is triggered and a course of actions should be followed as defined by the return policy in the corporate agreement A policy in this context is a course of actions which can be expressed in a set of rules in terms of obligations  permissions and prohibitions  For example as a part of packing and shipping policy a supplier is obligated to pack the goods in a way that is safe for transportation and is prohibited from including hazardous material As another example as part of a pricing policy supplier is obligated to apply discount rates automatically on categories of goods as agreed Furthermore the buyer is prohibited from revealing these discount rates to third parties An obligation represents a course of actions that a role must perform while a bition represents a course of actions that a role must not do Rules may be embedded in policies For example a pricing rule may state that Buyer\222s standard desktops are priced at 20 off Supplier\222s retail Some of these rules could be quite complex For example the pricing rule may depend on a number of factors such as volume configuration timing and market conditions Policies tie together the concepts in a CA and representation of polices in XML-based formats enables parsing and querying specific conditions and rules in these policies A policy engine that supports the parsing and querying can be used to support aggregation of POs 4.2 e-Procurement under Negotiation Models Alternative to established corporate agreements between a buyer and a supplier buyer and supplier can negotiate the terms and conditions of a purchase based on a particular negotiation model Such negotiation can be completely automated or semi-automated and it may take Proceedings of the 2005 Ninth IEEE International ED OC Enterprise Computing Conference

from a few seconds to a few days to complete There are three basic negotiation models namely bidding  auction  and bargaining  The fundamental driver for negotiation in e-procurement is of course achieving business goals which are parameterized along multiple indices dimensions such as quality cost profitability reliability and desire for business relationship A negotiation is successful when an acceptable point is reached for the buyer in buyer\222s goal space and the same is true on the supplier side Other indices being equal cost is often an important motivation for buyer to aggregate POs to gain purchasing power This is because the cost of a PO often depends on the size value volume timing and repeated business of the purchase Naturally it also depends on supplier side current rules and policies For suppliers sale rules and policies change from time to time in order to reflect it\222s own production situation and market conditions Simple examples of supplier rules include advertisements like 223Free UPS Ground Shipping on all Orders over 75\224 223Get 10 off on your next purchase\224 223Buy two books get a third equal or less value free\224 and so on From these examples we can see that pricing policies depend on factors like purchase value repeated business and volume These pricing policies are pretty static as they do not have any adjustable variables For bargaining type of negotiations the price of a purchase may be within a range buyer gain some while supplier give some until they agree Exactly where the final price ends in the range depends on the business goals of the two sides Additional factors that will affect supplier\222s profit like long-term relationship repeated business will also come into play Since the focus of this document is not automated negotiation we will not further elaborate on this subject negotiation The description so far gives us sufficient information to develop an intelligent aggregation facility which will give buyers an edge in terms of order value volume and repeated business as well as other factors during negotiation It is clear that the intelligent aggregation facility will be able to help buyers to gain business age during negotiation be it automated or human-driven 5 Intelligent Aggregation Architecture in Enterprise e-Procurement In previous sections we described the information model for POs and making purchases under corporate agreement and negotiation As POs are generated by buyer representatives in different organizations of an enterprise or from multiple enterprises in a consortium kind of arrangements an aggregation facility can aggregate these POs wherever it is advantageous to do so By doing aggregation of POs instead of sending them as they were individually generated buyers can potentially make the best from the terms and incentives in the supply chain to reduce purchase and overhead cost Figure 2 shows the key technical elements in our aggregation facility We take a rule-based approach to aggregation in the intelligent aggregation facility A rule-based approach enables business goals to be embedded in rules and extended when additional aggregation strategies are discovered The aggregation rules are derived from two types of aggregation techniques attribute-based aggregation and semantics-based aggregation  although they are not mutually exclusive and can be used together at different stages of aggregation Attribute-based aggregation combines data elements based on their common set of attributes attribute values or attribute types meta-values For example purchase orders for desktops can be aggregated by their common supplier Semantics-based aggregation combines data elements based on their semantic relations For example bill of material is an aggregation of logically related parts As another example purchase orders for a desktop PC monitor printer zip drive and extra memory can be aggregated as a single purchase order based on a wholepart relationship by doing so you may get the printer and extra memory for free Semantics-based aggregation in the narrow sense denotes only a few types of explicit relations among data elements such as composition and inclusion In a broader semantically richer sense other types of explicit relations such as derivation entailment attribute and membership also become significant And the broadest semantically richest sense entails deduction and implicit relations enabling precise meanings of any aggregation relations to be represented and utilized For aggregation under corporate agreement the attributed-based aggregatio n is better suited because the terms and conditions are pretty much defined in the agreement For aggregation under dynamic negotiation the semantics-based aggregation is better suited because supplier sale policies change often and require dynamic semantic match making This aggregation facility can be inserted in the enterprise e-Procurement workflow as described in Figure 1 Figure 3 shows the insertion nt of the facility in buyer side of the workflow In the next section we use some concrete examples to show how the rule-based aggregation approach is used to aggregate POs in reducing procurement cost While reducing the number of POs by aggregating them automatically has value on its own e.g reduce overhead and transaction cost we will focus more on how direct cost like price and shipping can be reduced Proceedings of the 2005 Ninth IEEE International ED OC Enterprise Computing Conference \(EDOC\22205 0-7695-2441-9/05 $20.00 \251 2005  IEEE

6 Intelligent Aggregation of Purchase Orders in e-Procurement In this section we use concrete examples to show how the rule-based aggregation engine works with corporate agreement policy engine and negotiation service in the intelligent aggregation facility 6.1 Aggregation POs under Corporate Agreements In Section 3 we defined an information model for products in e-procurement In particular rules and constraints can be associated with attributes and between attributes of any product type This is an important extension to current XML schemas for product representation because it enables dynamic information rules and constraints to go together with static information product attributes Again we use plain entity-attribute representation instead of XML schemas for clarity while the conversion between them can be easily achieved We again use computing equipment as the type of goods an enterprise wants to purchase Also assume that a corporate agreement has been established between a buyer and a supplier Assume that the agreement states that packaging cost is included in the purchase price but shipping cost is extra It defines a pricing policy which consists of a set of rules for calculating price depending on product categories standard PC non-standard PC factory upgrade items and third party products A discount rate for standard products or a markup rate for third party products is defined for each category Buyer\222s total cost is the price adding the service and warranty cost and shipping cost as well as applicable taxes While the pricing policy looks complicated they can easily be represented as asetofrules 6.1.1 Purchase Orders Suppose we have the following purchase orders Larry from organization A requests for a standard desktop PC a 19\222 monitor and additional 256MB of memory Jon also from organization A requests for a standard desktop PC PO1 Attribute Buyer  Organization 223A\224 User 223Larry\224 Location 223PS\224 Attribute Supplier  mpany 223Dell\224 Catalog  http://\205/dell Attribute Product  223Optiplex GX150MT\224  a standard configuration desktop PC Attribute Quantity 1 Attribute BIN  11381  The required delivery date is a Range constraint any date within the next 30 days Attribute Required-Delivery-Date  today today+30 days Attribute S&H1 query\(UPS Product   a COMPUTED value say it\222s 39.95 Attribute Value  query\(Catalog Product a COMPUTED value Attribute Price1  Attribute Total1  Inter-attribute constraints in PO1  Pricing rule for standard configuration from corporate agreement discount_rate x Price1  Value  1-x Total1  Price1+S&H1\1.088 assume 8.8 tax rate PO2 Attribute Buyer Organization 223A\224 User 223Larry\224 Location 223PS\224 Attribute Supplier  mpany  223Dell\224 Catalog  http://\205/dell Attribute Product  Monitor Size 19 Manufacturer Mitsubishi Attribute Quantity 1 Attribute BIN  11381 Attribute Required-Delivery-Date  today today+30 da    a R a nge c o nst r a i nt Attribute S&H2  query\(UPS Product   say it\222s 29.95 Attribute Value query\(Catalog Product a COMPUTED value Attribute Price2  Attribute Total2  Inter-attribute Constraints in PO2  PO2\222s delivery date must be the same as PO1\222s delivery date 1 PO2.Required-Delivery-Date  PO1.RequiredDelivery-Date  Pricing rule for THIRD_PARTY component from corporate agreement markup_rate y 2 Price2  Value  1+y 3 Total2  Price2  S&H2  1.088  assume 8.8 tax rate PO3 Attribute Buyer Organization 223A\224 User 223Larry\224 Location 223PS\224 Attribute Supplier  mpany  223Dell\224 Catalog  http://\205/dell Attribute Product  Memory Size 256 Unit 223MB\224 Attribute Quantity 1 Proceedings of the 2005 Ninth IEEE International ED OC Enterprise Computing Conference \(EDOC\22205 0-7695-2441-9/05 $20.00 \251 2005  IEEE

7 Conclusions and Future Work This paper describes an Intelligent Aggregation facility in enterprise e-Procurement process This facility introduces an information model a rule-based aggregation engine corporate agreement policies and negotiation in aggregating large volume of POs in enterprise eprocurement to reduce cost and maximize efficiency This information model includes extensive use of constraints for and among attributes in a PO These constraints guard the integrity of POs as they are aggregated The intelligent aggregation facility can be inserted as a value-added service in the enterprise e-Procurement workflow An enterprise generates millions of POs every year but the number of distinct products and services the enterprise purchases is actually much smaller in the hundreds rather than in the millions This presents cost saving opportunities by aggregating POs that makes best use of terms and conditions in corporate agreements or supplier offers Some concrete examples are used to show the idea of automated aggregation and the opportunities in reducing procurement cost As millions of POs are generated even a small percentage of savings would mean substantial savings for large enterprises The ideas described in this paper have not been fully implemented in our prototype One area needs more work is the formal representation of policies in corporate agreements which would allow the aggregation engine to automatically explore aggregation opportunities before POs are made to suppliers Another is the semantic model of products which would enable more semantics-based aggregation of POs 8 References  e bX M L  h t t p   w w w ebxml  org  2 e n g  J  S u  S  Y  W  L a m H   a n dH e l a l S   223Achieving Dynamic Inter-Organizational Workflow Management by Integrating Business Processes Events and Rules,\224 Proceedings of the 35th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences HICSS35 Hawaii USA January 2002 3 u  S  Y  W  L a m H   L e e  M  B a i S   a n dS h e n  Z   An Information Infrastructure and E-services for Supporting Internet-based Scalable E-business Enterprises Proceedings of the 5th International Enterprise Distributed Object Computing Conference Seattle Washington USA September 2001 4 S u S Y  W   H ua ng C  H a mme r J   H u a ng Y   L i  H   Wang,L.,LiuY.,Pluempitiwiriyawej,C.,Lee,M and Lam H 223An Internet-based Negotiation Server for E-commerce,\224 VLDB Journal Vol 10 No 1 2001 pp.72-90 5 M o r r i s S l o m a n  223 P o l i c y D ri v e n M an ag em e n t f o r Distributed Systems\224 Journal of Network and Systems Management Plenum Press Vol 2 No 4 1994  M aarten S teen  J oh n D errick  223 For m ali s ing ODP Enterprise Policies\224 Proceedings of the 3 rd International nterprise Distributed Object Computing Conference Mannheim Germany IEEE CS Press September 1999  J am e s H a ns on  Z oran M i l o s e v i c 223 C o n v e r s at i onOriented Protocols for Contract negotiations\224 Proceedings of the 7th International Enterprise Distributed Object Computing Conference Brisbane Australia IEEE CS Press September 2003  S  N eal J  C ole P.F L i n i ng ton  Z  Milose v i c S Gibson S Kulkarni 223Identifying Requirements for Business Contract Language a Monitoring Perspective\224 Proceedings of the 7th International Enterprise Distributed Object Computing Conference Brisbane Australia IEEE CS Press September 2003 9 T  D im itrak o s  I  D j o rd j e v i c Z  Milo sev i c A  J o san g  C Phillips 223Contract Performance Assessment for Secure and Dynamic Virtual Collaborations\224 Proceedings of the 7th International Enterprise Distributed Object Computing Conference Brisbane Australia IEEE CS Press September 2003 Proceedings of the 2005 Ninth IEEE International ED OC Enterprise Computing Conference \(EDOC\22205 0-7695-2441-9/05 $20.00 \251 2005  IEEE 


absolute values. The results can vary on other computers. But it can be guaranteed that performance ratio of the algorithms will remain the same After making the comparisons with sample data, we came to the conclusion that PD algorithm performs significantly better than the other two especially with larger datasets. PD outperforms DCP and PIP regarding running time. On the other hand, since PD reduces the dataset, mining time does not necessary increase as the number of transactions increases and experiments reveals that PD has better scalability than DCP and PIP. So, PD has the ability to handle the large data mine in practical field like market basket analysis and medical report documents mining 5. References 1] R. Agrawal and R.

tors such as union, di?erence and intersection are de?ned for pairs of classes of the same pattern type Renaming. Similarly to the relational context, we consider a renaming operator ? that takes a class and a renaming function and changes the names of the pattern attributes according to the speci?ed function Projection. The projection operator allows one to reduce the structure and the measures of the input patterns by projecting out some components. The new expression is obtained by projecting the formula de?ning the expression over the remaining attributes [12 Note that no projection is de?ned over the data source since in this case the structure and the measures would have to be recomputed Let c be a class of pattern type pt. Let ls be a non empty list of attributes appearing in pt.Structure and lm a list of attributes appearing in pt.Measure. Then the projection operator is de?ned as follows ls,lm c id s m f p ? c, p = \(pid, s, d,m, f In the previous de?nition, id ing new pids for patterns, ?mlm\(m projection of the measure component and ?sls\(s ned as follows: \(i s usual relational projection; \(ii sls\(s and removing the rest from set elements. The last component ?ls?lm\(f computed in certain cases, when the theory over which the formula is constructed admits projection. This happens for example for the polynomial constraint theory 12 Selection. The selection operator allows one to select the patterns belonging to one class that satisfy a certain predicate, involving any possible pattern component, chosen among the ones presented in Section 5.1.1 Let c be a class of pattern type pt. Let pr be a predicate. Then, the selection operator is de?ned as follows pr\(c p Join. The join operation provides a way to combine patterns belonging to two di?erent classes according to a join predicate and a composition function speci?ed by the user Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE Let c1 and c2 be two classes over two pattern types pt1 and pt2. A join predicate F is any predicate de?ned over a component of patterns in c1 and a component of patterns in c2. A composition function c pattern types pt1 and pt2 is a 4-tuple of functions c cStructureSchema, cDataSchema, cMeasureSchema, cFormula one for each pattern component. For example, function cStructureSchema takes as input two structure values of the right type and returns a new structure value, for a possible new pattern type, generated by the join. Functions for the other pattern components are similarly de?ned. Given two patterns p1 = \(pid1, s1, d1,m1, f1 p2 = \(pid2, s2, d2,m2, f2 p1, p2 ned as the pattern p with the following components Structure : cStructureSchema\(s1, s2 Data : cDataSchema\(d1, d2 Measure : cMeasureSchema\(m1,m2 Formula : cformula\(f1, f2 The join of c1 and c2 with respect to the join predicate F and the composition function c, denoted by c 1   F  c  c 2   i s  n o w  d e  n e d  a s  f o l l o w s    F  c  c 2     c  p 1   p 2   p 1    c 1  p 2    c 2  F   p 1   p 2     t r u e   5.1.3.

Drill-Through. The drill-through operator allows one to navigate from the pattern layer to the raw data layer Thus it takes as input a pattern class and it returns a raw data set. More formally, let c be a class of pattern type pt and let d be an instance of the data schema ds of pt. Then, the drill-through operator is denoted by c c Data-covering. Given a pattern p and a dataset D sometimes it is important to determine whether the pattern represents it or not. In other words, we wish to determine the subset S of D represented by p \(p can also be selected by some query the formula as a query on the dataset. Let p be a pattern, possibly selected by using query language operators, and D a dataset with schema \(a1, ..., an ible with the source schema of p. The data-covering operator, denoted by ?d\(p,D responding to all tuples in D represented by p. More formally d\(p,D t.a1, ..., t.an In the previous expression, t.ai denotes a speci?c component of tuple t belonging to D and p.formula\(t.a1, ..., t.an instantiated by replacing each variable corresponding to a pattern data component with values of the considered tuple t Note that, since the drill-though operator uses the intermediate mapping and the data covering operator uses the formula, the covering ?\(p,D D = ?\(p not be equal to D. This is due to the approximating nature of the pattern formula 5.1.4. Cross-over pattern base operators OCP Pattern-covering. Sometimes it can be useful to have an operator that, given a class of patterns and a dataset, returns all patterns in the class representing that dataset \(a sort of inverse data-covering operation Let c be a pattern class and D a dataset with schema a1, ..., an pattern type. The pattern-covering operator, denoted as ?p\(c,D all patterns in c representing D. More formally p\(c,D t.a1, ..., t.an true Note that: ?p\(c,D p,D 6. Related Work Although signi?cant e?ort has been invested in extending database models to deal with patterns, no coherent approach has been proposed and convincingly implemented for a generic model There exist several standardization e?orts for modeling patterns, like the Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML  eling approach, the ISO SQL/MM standard [2], which is SQL-based, and the Common Warehouse Model CWM  ing e?ort. Also, the Java Data Mining API \(JDMAPI 3] addresses the need for a language-based management of patterns. Although these approaches try to represent a wide range of data mining result, the theoretical background of these frameworks is not clear. Most importantly, though, they do not provide a generic model capable of handling arbitrary cases of pattern types; on the contrary only a given list of prede?ned pattern types is supported To our knowledge, research has not dealt with the issue of pattern management per se, but, at best, with peripheral proximate problems. For example, the paper by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement 


per by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement of similarity \(or deviation, in the authors  vocabulary between decision trees, frequent itemsets and clusters Although this is already a powerful approach, it is not generic enough for our purpose. The most relevant research e?ort in the literature, concerning pattern management is found in the ?eld of inductive databases Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE meant as databases that, in addition to data, also contain patterns [10], [7]. Our approach di?ers from the inductive database one mainly in two ways. Firstly, while only association rules and string patterns are usually considered there and no attempt is made towards a general pattern model, in our approach no prede?ned pattern types are considered and the main focus lies in devising a general and extensible model for patterns Secondly, di?erently from [10], we claim that the peculiarities of patterns in terms of structure and behavior together with the characteristic of the expected workload on them, call for a logical separation between the database and the pattern-base in order to ensure e?cient handling of both raw data and patterns through dedicated management systems Finally, we remark that even if some languages have been proposed for pattern generation and retrieval 14, 11], they mainly deal with speci?c types of patterns \(in general, association rules sider the more general problem of de?ning safe and su?ciently expressive language for querying heterogeneous patterns 7. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper we have dealt with the issue of modelling and managing patterns in a database-like setting Our approach is enabled through a Pattern-Base Management System, enabling the storage, querying and management of interesting abstractions of data which we call patterns. In this paper, we have \(a de?ned the logical foundations for the global setting of PBMS management through a model that covers data patterns and intermediate mappings and \(b language issues for PBMS management. To this end we presented a pattern speci?cation language for pattern management along with safety constraints for its usage and introduced queries and query operators and identi?ed interesting query classes Several research issues remain open. First, it is an interesting topic to incorporate the notion of type and class hierarchies in the model [15]. Second, we have intentionally avoided a deep discussion of statistical measures in this paper: it is more than a trivial task to de?ne a generic ontology of statistical measures for any kind of patterns out of the various methodologies that exist \(general probabilities Dempster-Schafer, Bayesian Networks, etc. [16 nally, pattern-base management is not a mature technology: as a recent survey shows [6], it is quite cumbersome to leverage their functionality through objectrelational technology and therefore, their design and engineering is an interesting topic of research References 1] Common Warehouse Metamodel \(CWM http://www.omg.org/cwm, 2001 2] ISO SQL/MM Part 6. http://www.sql99.org/SC32/WG4/Progression Documents/FCD/fcddatamining-2001-05.pdf, 2001 3] Java Data Mining API http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/73.prt, 2003 4] Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML http://www.dmg.org

The reason of the hiding failure of SWA is the same in Fig.8 Notice the result at x = 0.7646 in Fig.14, because the hiding failure is occurred at the seeds of the sensitive patterns, a high weakness is produced As shown in Fig.15 and Fig.16, the misses cost and dissimil arity of our work decreases as RL2 increases. This is because the larger RL2 is, the less effect on non-sensitive patterns. Also weakness and dissimilarity of SWA are independent of RL2 5. Conclusion In the paper, a novel method improving the balance between sensitive knowledge protecting and discovery on frequent patte rns has been proposed. By setting entries of a sanitization matrix to appropriate values and multiplying the original database by the matrix with some probability policies, a sanitized database is gotten. Moreover, it can avoid F-I Attack absolutely when the confidence level given by users approximates to 1. The experimental results revealed that although misses cost and dissimilarity between the original and sanitized database of our process are little more than SWA, ours provide more safely protection than SWA. Unlike SWA, our sanitization process could not suffer from F-I Attack and the probability policies in our approach also take the minimum support into account, the users only need to decide the confidence level which affects the degree of patterns hiding 6.
