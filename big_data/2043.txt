In this paper the performance of two preemptive retransmission schemes for protection of priority data over deep-space Ka-band links is evaluated The first scheme merges the correctly received bit from each transmission to create the most complete set of priority data for each pass bit merge The second scheme symbol combining combines the soft symbols received from each transmission of the pri\255 ority data

to increase the priority data's signal to noise ratio SNR thus increasing the likelihood of their correct recep\255 tion These performances were then compared to an equiva\255 lent margin scheme in which the data rate used for the trans\255 mission of the priority data is reduced by a factor equal to the number of transmissions of the priority data The per\255 formance of each scheme was evaluated through emulation using Water Vapor Radiometer WVR and Advanced Wa\255 ter Vapor Radiometer AWVR sky brightness temperature measurements along with models for Deep Space Network DSN Ka-band capable antenna using Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's DSN tracking schedule 
and geometry The results indicate that bit merge and reduced rate schemes perform roughly the same in terms of availability of the priority data at least 97 compared to 93 without any data protections scheme but for bit merge priority data losses occur over fewer passes than for the reduced rate scheme The sym\255 bol combining scheme is superior to both the bit merge and the reduced rate schemes with at least 98.5 priority data availability with losses over a small number of passes Receivers have a minimum demodulation threshold SNR and combining algorithms have combining losses therefore the performance of the symbol combining scheme

was also evaluated with respect to these two factors The results indi\255 cate that even with current receivers the symbol combining scheme performs extremely well and the scheme is relatively robust with respect to combining losses TABLE OF CONTENTS

are interested in evaluating methods other than increasing the link margin to guarantee delivery of the priority data One method to increase the probability that priority data is re\255 ceived correctly is to use preemptive retransmission that is to transmit the priority data several times during the pass Such a preemptive retransmission scheme could be used in two ways The first method referred to as bit merge in this paper is to merge correctly received fragments of the priority data from each transmission to form a more complete set of data This method is very easy to implement as the ground systems al\255 ready have the 
means to combine data from retransmissions Also the coding used on the channel could be different for each transmission since the data merge occurs on the informa\255 tion bits after the decoding The second scheme referred to as symbol combining is to use the same exact coding this includes same exact block of information bits to generate the same exact block of channel symbols on the spacecraft for each transmission and then combine the received soft sym\255 bols optimally to increase each symbol's signal-to-noise ratio SNR thus increasing the likelihood of decoding the infor\255 mation correctly 
should be noted that implementation 
It 
of such a system could be quite complex since on the spacecraft the same exact channel symbols need to be generated for ev\255 ery transmission and on the ground the soft symbols need to be saved before combining could occur Two factors need to be considered for symbol combining First is the efficacy of the combining process If combining is ideal the resulting SNR is equal to the addition of all the SNR values from each transmission of the symbol However com\255 bining is never ideal and combining losses always exist be\255 cause of phase jitter on the demodulated signal both because

values However it should be noted that for all number of transmissions/rate reduction factor values the bit merge advantage is significantly higher at smaller 
values it has significantly less This is because the fundamental nature of the priority data protection is different between the bit merge and sym\255 bol combining on one hand and the reduced rate scheme on the other The bit merge and symbol combining use time diversity to protect the priority data while the reduced rate scheme uses additional margin to protect the data This implies that for bit merge and symbol combining all the transmissions of a priority bit have to suffer from bad weather in order for that priority bit not to be received correctly On the other hand for the reduced rate scheme to fail the weather degradation has to be greater than the margin avail5 
Performance Metrics 
0.2 
This analysis is straightforward Since the priority data are transmitted only once in this scheme WVR and A WVR data along with DSN models are used to evaluate the performance of the link during the transmission of the priority data At the end of the transmission period it is determined how much of the priority data was successfully received 3 RESULTS The analysis was performed for several different assumptions about the fraction of the priority data number of transmis\255 sions of the priority data and sensitivity of the receivers The parameter 
the higher is the availability of the priority data For example with the minimum elevation requirement for the priority data was met see Fig 4 For the symbol combining algorithm the performance was evaluated for receivers with minimum sym\255 bol SNR SSNR values of 11 dB 11.5 dB 12 dB 12.5 dB 13 dB and 13.5 dB Note that currently the DSN Block V Receiver BVR has a minimum SSNR tracking capability of approximately 11 dB with BPSK modulation In addition we considered the case with three transmissions of the priorAlthough for

equal to two three and four respectively Again these results indicate that all schemes under consideration substantially decrease the number of passes with priority data loss from 73 passes without priority data protection to at most 26 passes for equal to two three and four respectively As seen from these figures all schemes under consideration provide substantial protection for the priority data increasing the availability of the priority data to at least 0.96 for

Two performance metrics are of interest the completeness of the priority data in terms of the fraction of data received and the number of passes with priority data loss These two metrics give an understanding of how often and how much of the priority data is lost As mentioned in Section 2 not only the overall availability of the priority data is important but also the number of passes over which priority data is lost Figs 8 9 and 10 show the number of passes with priority data loss for

value for the reduced rate scheme That is why for the reduced rate scheme the number of passes with priority data loss is a non-decreasing function of In this paper we have introduced two schemes that use pre\255 emptive retransmission to provide additional protection for priority data and compared their performance with a simple equivalent margin policy implemented through a reduction of the data rate Performance of each scheme was evaluated us\255 ing DSN models for Ka-band performance of the ground an\255 tennas along with the data from WVR and A WVR for differ\255 ent priority fractions of the total data The analysis indicates that if a simple bit merge scheme is used without symbol combining the preemptive retransmission and the reduced rate scheme have roughly the same performance in terms of availability of the priority data however for the bit merge scheme priority data losses are concentrated in fewer passes than the reduced rate scheme Using symbol combining with preemptive retransmission provides significantly supe\255 rior performance to the reduced rate and the bit merge

contributions in CWNs. For instance, who are the main contributors of CWNs and what are their benefits? Why do community members contribute to CWNs? What are the main management issues? How can we aggregate and measure their tangible and intangible contributions and benefits The main limitation of this framework is the difficulty of aggregating the tangible and intangible contributions of the community in order to assess their contributions in the total cost of the project. Another limitation is the difficulty to assess the contribution of each of the discussed collective action in the overall implementation and operation costs of the network In our analysis, we pointed out the important facets of collective actions and cooperation, rather than review such actions thoroughly. We will expand this multidisciplinary study in the future to empirically test the relationship between the collective actions in the domain of CWNs and other dimensions of social capital. We will also investigate the role of these networks in creating human capital and physical capital  7  Conclusion  The evolution of CWNs shows the significance of social capital embedded in communities and its role in boosting digital inclusion. We proposed a framework that encompasses the role of collective actions and cooperation in the creation of CWNs. These collectives include OSS, money donations, providing technical expertise, voluntary work, node-sharing, and hardware donations. We attributed these collective actions as outcomes of the social capital embedded in the communities This study improves our understanding of the capabilities of social capital, specifically in the digital domain. It shows that social capital constitutes a valuable resource for community development, taking advantage of digital innovations. The relationship between CWNs and social capital is expected to gain more attention from the scientific community. This is mainly due to the explosive growth of groups and communities that develop hardware and software products for the public use  8. Acknowledgement  9.  References   1 A. Abdelaal and H.

target item falls in TH category. To improve effectiveness of a segment attack, we select filler items from the set of items which are highly rated by those users who have rated target item at a higher Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 scale. The strategy used is similar to Strategy IH Filler items are selected the way explained in section 6.2  8. Experimental evaluation and discussion  We performed the experimental evaluation of our strategies on the publicly available MovieLens data set [8]. This is the most widely used dataset in recommender systems research. MovieLens consists of 100,000 ratings made by 943 users on 1682 movies. Each user in the data set has rated at least 20 movies and each movie has been rated at least once A timestamp value is associated with each user movie, and rating combination. The data set also contains information on the demographic detail \(age sex, occupation, and zip code information \(genre and release date The ratings are made in a scale of 1 to 5, where 5 indicate extreme likeness for an item and 1 dislike We evaluated effectiveness of the proposed strategies on user-based and item-based collaborative algorithm. For similarity calculation and prediction in user-based CF algorithm, equations 1 and 2 stated in section 3 were used. Similarly, equations 3 and 4 stated in section 3 were used for computing similarity and prediction value for item-based CF algorithm We used a neighborhood size of k = 20 for prediction calculation. Case amplification value of 10 was used while calculating correlation and only positive correlations values were considered for computing predictions To conduct our evaluation, we selected a sample 20 items. Out of the 20 items, 10 items belonged to TL  category while remaining 10 items to TH category All the 20 items were selected randomly from a larger set of items belonging to each category. We also randomly selected a sample of 50 target users Target users selected were those who have never rated any of the 20 test items. Each of the target items was attacked individually and the prediction shift was calculated by averaging the prediction shift observed for each user. The final prediction shift for the attack is the average prediction over all items used in the test. Equation 6 was used to calculate the metric For implementation of segmented attack we followed the same guidelines as stated in [3]. Horror segment was selected as the target segment. Five of the most popular horror movies were selected to represent the segment. These five movies selected formed the selected item set in the attack profiles constructed. The five movies are Alien, Psycho, The Shining, Jaws, and The Birds. Users who have given a rating of 4 or 5 to at least any 3 of the five movies were identified as the target segment against which the attack was focused. For calculating prediction shift we selected 50 of the users from this target segment to form the test user set. While implementing the segment attack, selected items were given a rating of 5 and the randomly selected filler items were assigned a value 1 All experiments were conducted for ?Size of attack? values 1%, 3%, 6%, 12%, and 15%.  ?Size of attack? represents number of attack profiles added as a percentage of pre-attack profiles. 1% ?Size of attack? implies 10 attack profiles were added to a 


attack? implies 10 attack profiles were added to a system of 1000 genuine users. On the basis of the results reported in [4] that best results are reported when a filler size of 3% is used in an average attack we used a filler size of 3% for all our tests i.e., 3 % of 1682 items which is approximately 50 filler items For attacks against user-based collaborative filtering systems we used six strategies: Strategy UL, Strategy UH, Strategy SUL, Strategy SUH, segment attack and average attack. Similarly, for attacks against item based collaborative filtering systems we used six strategies: Strategy IL, Strategy IH Strategy SIL Strategy SIH, segment attack and average attack. For average attack, filler item strategy used was the same as in an average attack i.e., the mean of the filler item was assigned to it. Segment attack was implemented as explained earlier. Category TL, Category TH Strategy UL, Strategy UH, Strategy IL, Strategy IH Strategy SUL, Strategy SUH, Strategy SIL and Strategy SIH were implemented the way explained earlier in section 4, section 5, section 6 and section 7 respectively. For attacks against item-based CF while selecting filler items from set IF, only items with minimum frequency count of 10 were considered Figure 2 and Figure 3 show the effectiveness of our attacks when calculated for all users against systems using user-based collaborative filtering for recommendations.  Figure 2 shows the prediction shift values of attacks Strategy UL and average attack for items belonging to TL category. From the graph it?s obvious that for items in TL category, Strategy UL outperforms average attack model for all values of attack size. Similarly, Figure 3 shows the prediction shift values for the attack strategies Strategy UH and average attack for items belonging to TH category From the graph it can be concluded that for items belonging to TH category, Strategy UH performs much better than average attack over lower values of attack size. At attack size of 12 % and 15% both attack have similar effectiveness Figure 4 and Figure 5 show the effectiveness of our attacks when calculated for all users against systems using item-based collaborative filtering for recommendations.  Figure 4 shows the prediction shift values of Strategy IL and average attack for Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 items belonging to TL category. Similarly, Figure 5 shows the prediction shift values for the Strategy IH and average attack for items belonging to TH category. From Figure 4 and 5 it can be concluded that both Strategy IL and Strategy IH perform substantially better than average attack over all values of attack size. It can also be observed that our attack strategies are more effective against itembased systems than user-based systems Figure 6, 7, 8, and 9 show the effectiveness of our filler based attack strategies for in-segment users. We observe that for attacks against both user-based and item-based CF systems the effectiveness of our filler based strategies is comparable to the best available attack model for in-segment attacks i.e., segment attack. However, in Figure 8 we observe that filler item strategy SIL performs better than segment attack. Because of the low knowledge cost involved in segment attack, we can conclude that for most scenarios segment attack is a better attack model for in-segment attacks than filler based attack models Experimental results clearly show that our approach of selecting a strategy based on target item rating distribution outperforms the best available attack model i.e., average model. One drawback of 


attack model i.e., average model. One drawback of our attack strategies is its high knowledge cost However, automated software agents can help diminish the cost. One approach that can be used to decrease the cost is to use a subset of users while selecting filler items. For example, in attacks against item-based systems, while implementing Strategy IH instead of selecting all users who have rated target item as 4 or 5 as members of the set UH. , we only select 20 users. Selection of items for set IF will then be performed using the data of the 20 users in set UH Similarly, in case of attacks against user-based systems, while implementing Strategy UH instead of assigning a filler item IF the average rating given to it by the set of users UH. , we assign IF the average rating given to it by a subset of 5 randomly selected users from UH. In future work we plan to experimentally verify the effectiveness of these cost reduction approaches    Figure 2:   Attack on TL category of items against user-based collaborative filtering system   Figure 3:   Attack on TH   category of items against user-based collaborative filtering system   Figure 4:   Attack on TL category of items against item-based collaborative filtering system  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8  Figure 5:   Attack on TH category of items against item-based collaborative filtering system   Figure 6:   Attack on TL category of items against user-based collaborative filtering system   Figure 7:   Attack on TH   category of items against user-based collaborative filtering system    Figure 8:   Attack on TL category of items against item-based collaborative filtering system   Figure 9:   Attack on TH category of items against item-based collaborative filtering system  9. Conclusion  This paper provides an effective approach towards constructing attack models. We show the importance of target item and filler items in construction of successful attack strategies. Through experiments we show that our approach of intelligent selection of filler items based on target item rating distribution results in substantial improvement over the baseline average attack. We also compare our approach with the well known in-segment approach and conclude that our approach gives slightly improved results. In future, we plan to examine the filler items strategies for other attack models, and also create algorithms to improve robustness and stability of recommender systems against shilling attacks

pursuing an integrated approach to diagnostics and prognostics, combining technologies for enhanced data preprocessing, advanced diagnostic-support algorithms, fusion at the sensor/feature levels, and an adequate framework for false alarm mitigation and uncertainty management. An architecture for achieving such integration is presented, with emphasis on supporting a robust performance of diagnostics operations, even in the presence of such kinds of disturbances as those observed in data acquired by HUMS vibration sensors. The present study also gives relevance to seeded fault because the technologies discussed can integrate knowledge about damage mechanism interactions or physics-of-failure models, as well as make use of multiple-sensor and multiple-feature data sets representative of known fault conditions For this reason, the team behind this project is evaluating a potential opportunity to perform a series of tests on rotorcraft drive train bearings with varying fault severities and under multiple, though realistic, operating conditions Such tests are being planned to provide algorithm/model validations, as well as diagnostic/prognostic performance assessments, in support of providing the U.S. Army with technologies that make detection systems more robust allow for the implementation of prognostics, and extend the useful life of drive train components.

movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews however, there was no big difference between mainstream and non-mainstream movies. WOM and critical reviews were usually positive H1 and H2 tested the relationship between WOM and weekly box office revenue, and the results supported the hypotheses. The volume of WOM was positively related to weekly box office revenue, while the valence of WOM had no significant effect. H3 H4a, and H4b tested the impact of critical reviews, and the results also supported the hypotheses except H4b The volume and valence of critical reviews had no consistent significances to weekly box office revenue H3 H4b. Table 7 showed that the number of critical reviews was statistically significant to aggregate box office revenue \(H4a for the attitude of critical reviews \(H4b the result more detail, an additional test was performed using only those factors related to critical reviews as independent variables. The result of the additional test supported H4, but the signs were reversed, i.e. positive critical reviews had minus signs, and negative critical reviews had plus signs. This reversed signs imply that the preference of critical reviewers is very similar to that of normal moviegoers. H5s and H6s tested the different effects of WOM and critical reviews on mainstream and non-mainstream movies. The result failed to determine that WOM give different impact on mainstream and non-mainstream movies, so H5a and H5b were rejected. H6, however, was supported, i.e the effects of critical reviews were different for mainstream and non-mainstream movies. There were no significant relationships between critical reviews and aggregate box office revenue in mainstream movies. For non-mainstream movies, however, the volume of critical reviews and the percentage of negative critical reviews were significant. Nonmainstream movies have fewer sources from which consumers can get information, and this might explain the results The above findings lead to several managerial implications. First, producers and distributors of movies could forecast weekly box office revenue by looking at previous weeks? volume of WOM. It does not matter what attitude people have when they spread WOM, the important factor is its volume. Therefore producers and distributors need to develop an appropriate strategy to manage WOM for their movies For example, the terms related to WOM marketing such as buzz and viral marketing are easily found Second, for the distributors who usually distribute less commercial and more artistic movies, and consequently have a smaller market compared to the major distributors, critical reviews can impact their movies box office revenues in a significant way. There are usually fewer sources for information for nonmainstream movies than mainstream movies, and so small efforts could leverage the outcomes. Finally, for those who are dealing with mainstream movies, the finding that the valence of WOM and critical reviews do not have significant relationship with box office revenue can have certain implications. Particularly, the attitude of critical reviews showed reversed effects Therefore, they may need to concentrate on other features rather than attitude of moviegoers or critical reviews, such as encouraging moviegoers to spread WOM This study contributes to the understanding of the motion picture industry, especially the relationship between box office revenue and WOM including critical reviews. There are existing studies that already 


critical reviews. There are existing studies that already dealt with similar issues, but this study has some differentiated features compare to prior studies. First the data used in this study was collected from South Korea, while most of the relevant studies usually focus on the North American market. This helps to provide the opportunity to understand the international market especially the Asian market, even though South Korea is a small part of it in terms of the motion picture industry. Second, movies were categorized to two groups, i.e. mainstream and non-mainstream and this study attempted to determine how WOM impacts these categories differently by testing several hypotheses In this study, there are also several limitations that could be dealt with in future research. First, using box office revenue as a dependent variable is more meaningful for distributers rather than producers. Due to there is close correlation between box office revenue and number of screens, one of producers? main concerns is how many screens their movies can be played on. Moreover, DVD sales are also important measurement for success of movies these days, and so it also could be a dependent variable. Therefore, it could be possible to give more fruitful managerial implications to various players in the motion picture industry by taking some other dependent variables Second, in this study, movies were categorized simply as mainstream and non-mainstream movies, but there could be further studies with diverse techniques of movie categorizations. For example, it would be possible to study the varying influence of WOM or critical reviews on different genres or movie budgets Third, an interesting finding of this study is that positive critical reviews could have negative relationship with box office revenue while negative critical reviews could have positive relationship. This study tried to provide a reasonable discussion on the issue, but more studies could be elaborate on it  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 References  1] Dellarocas, C., The Digitization of Word of Mouth Promise and Challenges of Online Feedback Mechanisms Management Science, 2003. 49\(10 2] Bone, P.F., Word-of-mouth effects on short-term and long-term product judgments.
