Mining Associated Implication Networks: Computational Intermarket Analysis Phil Tse and Jiming Liu Department of Computer Science Hang Kong Baptist University philtse@alum hkbu.edu hk Abstract Current attempts to ana/yze international financial markets include the use offinancial technical analysis and data mining techniques In this paper we propose a new approach that incorporates implication networks and 
association rules to form an associaled nefwork struclure The proposed approach explicitly addresses the issue of local vs global influences betweenfinancial markets 1 Introduction Conventional wisdom has it that financial markets around the globe are interrelated To cite an example commodity prices and the U.S dollar move in an opposite direction. This kind of intermarket actions can be further 
divided into two perspectives In a local perspective various markets in a certain country such as stock currency and bond markets interact with each other While in a global perspective, the same kind of markets e.g US stock markets and other stock markets in the world tends to be highly correlated. Current attempts to analyze international financial markets include the use of financial technical analysis and data mining These efforts however, do not make a clear distinction between the local 
and global perspectives of intermarket actions In this light we propose a new paradigm to analyze these intermarket actions by mining probabilistic networks and association rules The discovered networks and rules form an associated network structure in which the distinction of local and global perspectives becomes possible 1.1 Related Work In our approach, we employ probabilistic networks to formulate interactions in a global perspective Some traditional examples of inferring 
schemes over probabilistic networks are presented in Charniak's 3 work A number of algorithms were proposed to derive probabilistic networks More modern works in this field include Liu and Desmarais 5 which proposed a method of learning implication networks from empirical data Myers et al 7 proposed a method of learning Bayesian networks from incomplete data using evolutionary 0-7695-1754-4102 17.00 0 2002 IEEE 689 jiming@comp

that are always stronger than association rules because their elicitations are based on rigid statistical testing The tests however are sometimes too rigid that some subtle hut novel rules would he rejected during the testing process Association rules on the other hand, often represent more novel e.g support can be as low as 0.1 depending on the nature of the domain but useful relationships We therefore use a combination of these two techniques to form an associated network structure 
In summary, the components of an associated network structure are illustrated in Figure 1  Figure 1 An associated network The implication networks are connected by association rules 2.1 Discovery of an Associated Network Structure As pointed out by Liu and Desmarais 5 six types of implication relationship exist between any pair of nodes 


i.e. A 3 B A  B A B A 2 B A 0 B and A t B The elicitations of these implication relationships are based on statistical examinations which are referred to as hypothesis tests on empirical data 4 The hypothesis testing works as follows For any implication relation A 3 B the following two conditions must be satisfied P B I A  I P\(-A I B  I 1 4 The hypothesis testing examines Conditions I and 2 by computing the lower hound of a I-aJ confidence interval around the measured conditional probabilities This would allow the elicitation of implication relationship become possible under sampling errors The implication induction algorithm of Liu and Desmarais 5 is stated as follows Liu's aodpesmanL h~li&tidn~tndo   Bein     set a significance level 4 pmbabilityp for anclwork        For node i E O 11-11 and node j i+l    I    Begin      or allempirical case samp~is         E Computeawntin c table 3  1       Where-N NU N Nu are e numbm of psumnces with respect,to the following   e  dwmbinations       _ NIL nodei=TaUE A nodei=TRUE 1        N*1:node,=FALSE"node,=FALSE NI nodei=~UE"riode;=FALSE N2t nodei=FALSE"nodq=TRF For each implicafion type k out of the six possible  ewes  Begin Test the follownE IneQUaltN bared on the lower tails of binomial distributions Binf?f,pMJ and Bin N pnlJ where N and N denote thc oefurrences of antwedent satisfactions in the two inferences using a typs k implication relation i.e in moduponens and modus rollem resptively    Ifthe test succeeds then   ReNm atype k implication relation End   End End  Associated with each established relationship are weights representing the certainty of the relation In order to facilitate the later inferences the weights are estimated during the network structure discovery phase Theoretically two weights are associated with each type of implication relationship as an inference can be made either in forward or backward direction The weights are estimated from the empirical data samples Specifically the estimated conditional probability of the relation is used as the weight In our proposed approach the Apriori algorithm l][S is used to mine the association rules The nodes in each implication network are regarded as the items for the algorithm to generate itemsets which are required by the rules After the itemsets are generated rules with minimum confidence pc and support s are discovered Note that in our proposed approach it is only desirable to have association rules which connect different implication networks but do not connect the nodes in the same network After the induction of implication networks and the mining of association rules an associated network structure is ready for uncertainty reasoning purposes such as analyzing intermarket actions 3 Empirical Validation on Financial Market Analysis In order to validate our proposed approach we analyze several markets with an associated network structure discovered from empirical market data Murphy 6 points out the existing key relationships between the financial markets around the globe Among others there are four principal interrelated market sectors namely currencies commodities bonds and stocks Besides interest rates also play a significant role in affecting the markets We are interested in finding out the relationships between the aforementioned markets If the markets are correlated some empirical data samples of these markets can be used to discover a proposed network structure which reflects their relationships The empirically derived network structure can further he used to analyze the trends of the involved markets 3.1 Settings for the Validation Experiments The actual settings in our validation experiments are as Financial Market Selection With reference to the key intermarket relationships defined by Murphy 6 markets from the four principal market sectors from the United States and Japan are selected Selected indexes for the markets are as follows follows 1 U.S Market a USDIndex b CRB Index c Federal Reserve Fund Rate d IO-Year Treasuly Bond Yield e 0 Japanese Discoum Rate Dow Jones Industrial Moving Average Japanese Market 690 


g Nikkei 225 Stock Average h il IO-Year Benchmark Bond Yield jl Japanese Yen Red Effective Exchange Rale Composite Index of Business Indicators 2 Preparation of Empirical Data Samples Since the case study aims at investigating the long-term relationships of the selected financial markets monthly data is chosen for the experiments The data collected is within the period of December 1982 to December 2001 inclusively The data gathered however is only in a form of numerical values In the current study we are interested in the relationships between the markets e.g if the greenback goes down the commodities go up Therefore it is necessary to define what is 221up\222 and what is 221down\222 before any actual experiments can be carried out Therefore data has to be preprocessed to show the up and down trends of the markets The empirical data samples are further divided into a training set for the discovery of an associated network structure and a testing set for analysis and validation. In the case study, the training set includes empirical data samples fiom November 1983 to November 1992 inclusively The testing set includes those from December 1992 to December 2001 inclusively Discovery of an Associated Network Structure As pointed out by Murphy 6 the local financial markets influence each other more than the international markets do In this connection two implication networks will be generated one for the US market and one for the Japanese market The implication relationships within implication networks show the stronger influences between the markets in a local perspective while the association rules linking up the two implication networks show the weaker relations between the international markets The significance level n and a minimum conditional probability pn for the implication networks are 0.2 and 0.5 respectively The minimum confidence pc and minimum support s for the association rule mining are 0.6 and 0.1 respectively 3 3.2 Experimental Results This section presents the discovered network structure and the analysis and validation results using the mined associated network structure 3.2.1 The Discovered Network Structure With the empirical data samples from the training set the following implication networks representing the US and Japanese financial markets can be discovered Figure 2 and 3 Figure 2 An implication network for the US financial markets pmi 0.5 a 0.2 Figure 3 An implication network for the Japanese financial markets pmin 0.5  0.2 3.2.2 Association Rules Connecting the Networks AAer the induction of the two implication networks, the selected financial markets are used to generate itemsets for mining association rules The following association rules can be mined with the empirical data samples from the training set with the mining algorithm as stated in Section 2 Rule 1 Japanese Benchmark Bond Yield Increases/Decreases 4 U.S IO-Year Trearury Bond Yield IncrearedDecreaser Rule 11 Japanese Benchmark Bond Yield Increases/Decreases  U.S CRE Index Increaser/r Rule 3 Japanese Cornposit Index of Business Indicators Decreasedlncreaser  USD Index Decceasedlncreaser Rule 4 Nikkei 225 Stock Average Decrearesllncreases  US0 Index Decreascdlncreases Rule 5 Nikkei 225 Stock Average Decreaseshereaser Cornposit lndex of Business Indicators Decreasedlncreaser 3 USD Index Decreases/lncreases Rule 6 USD Index Deereasedlncreases, DOW Jones Industrial Average Decreasesllncreaser  Japanese Benchmark Bond Yield Increpsesllnereases Rule 7 USD Index Decreasesllncrepses U.S IO-Year Treasury Bond Yield IncreasesIDecreases DUW Jones Industrial Average Decrearedlncreases  Japanese Bond Yield IncreaseslDecreaser 1 691 


The above association rules along with the two implication networks constitute an associated network structure as defined in Section 2 3.2.3 Experiment to Evaluate the Overall Analysis Performance In this experiment two nodes from the U.S markets are randomly picked from each monthly empirical data sample as observed evidence. When the observed value is TRUE a belief value of 1 is given to the node if the observed value is FALSE a belief value of 0 is given The beliefs of the other nodes in the two implication networks are revised accordingly with the implication relationships and association rules When the updated belief value of a node is larger than 0.5 a TRUE value is assigned to the node or vice versa The estimated values of the updated nodes are further compared to the actual values in the same empirical data samples in the same month. Meanwhile we record the total number of correct and incorrect guesses within the implication network corresponding to the US financial markets as well as the total number of correct and incorrect guesses using the association rules and the implication network corresponding to the Japanese financial markets The above process is repeated five times that is five cycles For each cycle all the 109 monthly empirical data samples in the testing set are used The mean of the analysis accuracies using the US market implication network is 58.4671 with a standard deviation of 1.8453 For the other nodes in the Japanese market implication network the mean of the analysis accuracies is 66.6799 with a standard deviation of 5.4041 In general the accuracies of analysis using the entire discovered network structure remain stable, with the mean accuracy 61.2508 and a small standard deviation of 1.604 3.2.4 Experiment to Investigate the Effect of the Number of Observed Nodes on Analysis Performance In this experiment the number of nodes observed as evidences is controlled The experimental procedure is similar to that in the preceding experiments except the number of observed nodes which will be different The means of the analysis accuracy with the U.S markets implication network are 59.91 58.47 and 55.74 when I 2 and 3 node\(s idare observed respectively Surprisingly the mean accuracy decreases slightly as the number of nodes observed increases 4 Conclusion This paper has presented a novel approach to analyzing financial intermarket actions with a combination of implication networks and association rules The experiments show that the proposed analysis approach is able to model international financial markets with an automatic means of discovering an associated network structure The experiments further demonstrate the analysis ability of our proposed associated network structure It is believed that the innate weakly correlated nature of the financial markets is accountable for the low accuracy The stability of the proposed approach, however is remarkably high \(standard deviation of 1.604 One surprising result is that the analysis accuracy decreased as the number of observed nodes increased The reason subject to further examination is that multiple-path traversal is allowed in the multiply connected implication networks in our study An interesting extension of the present work, therefore would be to investigate the optimal traversing method for implication networks References I Agrawal R and Shafer J C Fast Algorithm for Mining Association Rules In Proceedings ofthe Zbh International Conference on Very Large Databases Santiago, Chile 1994 2 Bowes I Neufeld E Greer I E and Cooke J A Comparison of Association Rule Discovely and Bayesian Network Causal Inference Algorithms to Discover Relationships in Discrete Data In Canadian Conference on AI pages 326-336,2000 3 Chamiak E Bayesian Networks without Tears AI Magazine pages 53-6 I I99 I 4 Desmarais M C Maluf A and Liu J User-expertise Modeling with Empirically Derived Probabilistic Implication Networks User Modeling and User Adaptive Interactions 5\(3-4 pages 283-315,1996 5 Liu J and Desmarais M C A Method of Learning Implication Networks from Empirical Data Algorithm and Monte-Carlo Simulation-Based Validation IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering 9\(6 pages 990-1004 1997 6 Murphy I 3 lntermarket Technical Ana1ysis:Trading Strategies for the Global Stock Bond Commodily and Currency Markets United States 1 Wiley 1991 7 Myers J W Laskey K B and DeJong K A Learning Bayesian Networks from Incomplete Data using Evolutionary Algorithms In Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference Orlando FL, Morgan Kaufrnann 1999 8 Srikant R Fast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules and Sequential Patterns Ph D Thesis University of Wisconsin-Madison 1996 692

transform imposed by a divergent-convergent axon projection The selection of the basin of attraction is done by the stimulus given to the receptors feeding the primary receiving cortex The basins and their attractors are shaped by Hebbian and non-Hebbian learning as well as by reafferent barrages [Kay et al 1996 Kay and Freeman 19981 that bias and tilt the attractor landscape The trajectory manifested in the EEG is higher in dimension than the landscape so that every basin is immediately accessible from every point of the trajectory with minimal need for search Capture by one of the attractors reduces the dimension of activity below that of the landscape 6 Conclusions We are clearly still a long way from full understanding of intentionality in animals and even farther from constructing analog systems that will embody the principles of active perception by which brains achieve their ascendency The main inference that I wish to propose from these biological studies is that there is nothing mysterious or inaccessible about intentional behavior and that given the right insights into how simpler brains organize themselves in the necessary construction and pursuit of their own goals, there is no insuperable barrier to building devices that have those capacities There is already substantial progress in that direction through the development of embodied robots Clark 1996 Hendriks-Jansen 1996 Brooks 19991 It is not too soon to begin to consider the ethical issues that success in these projects will surely raise Acknowledgments This work was supported by grants from the National Institute of Mental Health and from the Office of Naval Research References Aquinas St. Thomas \(1272\The Summa Theologica Volume 19 in the Great Books Series Chicago:Encyclopedia Britannica Inc 1952 Barrie JM Freeman WJ Lenhart M 1996 Modulation by discriminative training of spatial patterns of gamma EEG amplitude and phase in neocortex of rabbits Journal of Neurophysiology Brooks R.A 1999 Cambrian Intelligence: The Early History of the New AI Cambridge MA MIT Press Clark A 1996\Being There.

dictive model for representing user behaviors and a useful mechanism for identifying and interpreting user behavior patterns for the Web data 7 Conclusions and Future Work We described a mixture model based approach to generating and visualizing individual behavior models for CiteSeer users We represented the Web data as a collection of ordered action sequences for each user We introduced a maximum entropy based approach for modeling the user behavior motivated by its ability to model long term dependencies in data sequences In addition to maxent model we also investigated the use of 336rst order Markov mixture models We demonstrated that both methods are able to generate strong predictive models with different strengths and weaknesses Markov model performed better for predicting the behavior of the known users whereas maximum entropy model was better at modeling the global behavior model and therefore the unknown users also We used a simple method to achieve personalization yet managed to avoid the insuf\336cient data problem of traditional personalization techniques By using mixture model based clustering we were able to identify and visualize speci\336c behavior patterns of CiteSeer users where it s demonstrated that maximum entropy model\325s computational cost pays off t recognizing complex dominant patterns of user behavior We plan to expand our work on identifying speci\336c user behavior patterns and provide customized services for instance customized recommendations for each of the behavior model groups We are also interested in naming these groups of users We intend to perform real-time experiments on CiteSeer with our maximum entropy based predictive model We are also planning to apply our personalization algorithm to mixtures of hidden Markov models and compare it with the maxent model proposed in this paper 8 Acknowledgements This work has been partially supported by a grant from Lockheed Martin We would like to thank Steve Lawrence for making

All requirements of this section apply in the vicinity of uninsulated but covered wires e.g weatherproof wires Requires employees to treat ungrounded metal parts of equipment transformer cases and breaker housing as energized unless known by test to be free from voltage Comments I APPA comments that it is impossible to enforce paragraph l\(3 which addresses the working position Situations arise where it is impossible to prevent contact APPA recommends that l\(3 be reworded to add where practicable and comments that work should generally be done from below rather than above energized parts APPA also recommends inclusion of reference to Tables 422-2 and 427-2 from the 1987 NESC which allows reduced clearances if switching surges are known The comparable tables in the current 1993 NESC are 441-3 and 441-4 EEI has expressed particular concern about the Clearance Section 1 with reference to maintenance of transmission facilities EEI has attached an extensive proposed revision to this section which includes clearance tables which are different than the ones included in the proposed Rules Their tables also include reduced clearances for situations where known transient overvoltage factors are present for transmission voltages 121 kV and greater Their attachment also includes calculations and backup material from which their proposed tables were derived This proposed attachment is in the form of a working agreement of EEI/lBEW Portions of the attachments which do not agree with IBEWs recommendations are indicated In a departure from the proposed Rules and the current 1993 NESC EEI proposes that facilities 300 volts and less not require the use of insulated equipment rubber gloves IBEW was not in concurrence with this proposal at the time it was submitted  1 Deenergizing Lines and Equipment for Emvlovee Protection m This section is analogous to section d which is included for power generation plants It applies to the deenergization of transmission and distribution lines and equipment for the purpose of protecting employees Included is a detailed procedure for deenergizing facilities if an employee must depend on others to operate switching to deenergize lines on which the employee is to work including transfer of responsibility, tagging and grounding Comments ml Both EEI and APPA recommend that this section be revised to cover only systems 600 volts and greater Additionally APPA and EEI comment that lockout procedures which are included in this section and the preceding section d should have a provision that the utility may use its own procedures if developed documented and implemented prior to the promulgation of these regulations EEI proposes a fairly extensive revision to Section m\which includes the following major changes from the OSHA version Places greater emphasis on the system operator in the lockout/tagout procedures Provides for record keeping of the operations by the system operator Places reduced emphasis on the original person requesting the clearance on the applicable lines Groriiidina for the Protection of Emvlovees n This section includes requirements for the protective grounding of transmission and distribution lines and equipment for the purpose of protecting employees For employees to work on lines which are treated as deenergized these lines must be deenergized A2-9 


according to section m and grounded Under certain unusual conditions the facilities need not to be grounded in accordance with these requirements There must be 1 no possibility of contact with another energized source and 2 no hazard of induced voltage This section Requires temporary protective grounds at each work location or on either side of the location if one location is not feasible Requires grounding equipment to have proper ampacity No 2 AWG copper minimum and low enough impedance to permit operation of protective devices in case of accidental energization Requires testing before grounding to determine absence of voltage Requires the ground end of the protective ground to be connected first, then the line end, using an insulated device Requires removal first from the line end using an insulated device Prohibits grounding cables at a remote location if a hazardous transfer of potential could occur under fault conditions Allows grounds to be temporarily removed for tests but requires previously grounded line to be considered energized during to test Comments n APPA comments that this section on grounding should apply to systems greater than 600 volts only Additionally both EEI and APPA submitted similar comments regarding flexibility which should be included to allow either single or dual point grounding or a combination of the two methods to allow employers to choose the method best for the particular situation APPA recommends that grounding should be allowed on lines where nominal voltage is not found In many cases facilities may be grounded when induced or static voltages are present APPA also comments that removal of grounds for cables being tested with low voltage should not require treatment of these cables as energized EEI believes that OSHA's requirement to require work location grounding where feasible is not workable, objecting to the word feasible as all encompassing Testing and Test Facilities 0 This section covers the proposed safe work practices for high-voltage and high-power testing performed in laboratories in shops and in substations under the exclusive control of an electric utility It does not cover routine functions for metering, relaying and normal line work Requirements addressed include the following Guarding of test areas  walls fences and barriers Grounding practices  similar to grounding requirements of other sections but requires isolated ground-return conductor system for high current testing Control and measuring circuits Safety check of test areas at beginning of each group of continuous tests Comments 0 APPA provided the following comments on this section Recommends clarification of the wording so that there is a clear distinction between this specialized testing and routine operations such as phasing and low voltage testing Recommends deletion of the requirement for an isolated ground return during high current testing citing that staged fault tests often involve large areas which would not allow this requirement to be met  asks that A2-10

is that this requirement is sufficiently performance oriented to meet the requirements for old installations according to the 1987 NEW Requires draw-out circuit breakers to be inserted and removed while in the open position and that if the design permits the control circuits be rendered inoperative while breakers are being inserted and removed stated in the Rules and requests that existing installations not be required to be modified to meet NESC APPA recommends that Section u 4 i which includes requirements for enclosing electric conductors and equipment to minimize unauthorized access to such equipment be modified to refer to only those areas which are accessible to the public Requires conductive fences around substations to be grounded Power Generation v Addresses guarding of energized parts  Fences screens, partitions or walls This section provides additional requirements and related work practices for power generating plants  Entrances locked or attended Special Conditions w  Warning signs posted  Live parts greater than 150 volts to be guarded or isolated by location or be insulated  Enclosures are to be according to the 1987 NESC Sections llOA and 124A1 and in 1993 NESC  Requires guarding of live parts except during an operation and maintenance function when guards are removed barriers must be installed to prevent employees in the area from contacting exposed live parts Requires employees who do not work regularly at the substation to report their presence Requires information to be communicated to employees during job briefings in accordance with Section \(c of the Rules Comments U APPA and EEI provide comments as follows Both believe that some older substations \(and power plants would not meet NESC as This paragraph proposes special conditions that are encountered during electric power generation, transmission and distribution work including the following Capacitors  Requires individual units in a rack to be short circuited and the rack grounded  Require lines with capacitors connected to be short circuited before being considered deenergized Current transformer secondaries may not be opened while energized and must be bridged if the CT circuit is opened Series street lighting circuits with open circuit voltages greater than 600 volts must be worked in accordance with Section q\or t and the series loop may be opened only after the source transformer is deenergized and isolated or after the loop is bridged to avoid open circuit condition Sufficient artificial light must be provided where insufficient naturals illumination is present to enable employee to work safely A2-17 


US Coast Guard approved personal floatation devices must be supplied and inspected where employees are engaged in work where there is danger of drowning Required employee protection in public work areas to include the following  Warning signs or flags and other traffic control devices  Barricades for additional protection to employees  Barricades around excavated areas  Warning lights at night prominently displayed Lines or equipment which may be sub to backfeed from cogeneration or other sources are to be worked as energized in accordance with the applicable paragraphs of the Rules Comments w APPA submits the following comments regarding this Special Conditions section Recommends that the wording regarding capacitors be modified to include a waiting period for five minutes prior to short circuiting and grounding in accordance with industry standards for discharging of capacitors For series street light circuits, recommends that language be added for bridging to either install a bypass conductor or by placement of grounds so that work occurs between the grounds Recommends modification of the section regarding personal floatation devices to not apply to work sites near fountains decorative ponds swimming pools or other bodies of water on residential and commercial property Definitions x This section of the proposed Rules includes definitions of terms Definitions particularly pertinent to understanding the proposal and which have not previously been included are listed as follows Authorized Employee  an employee to whom the authority and responsibility to perform a specific assignment has been given by the employer who can demonstrate by experience or training the ability to recognize potentially hazardous energy and its potential impact on the work place conditions and who has the knowledge to implement adequate methods and means for the control and isolation of such energy CZearance for Work  Authorization to perform specified work or permission to enter a restricted area Clearance from Hazard  Separation from energized lines or equipment Comments x The following summarizes the changes in some of the definitions which APPA recommends Add to the definition for authorized employee It the authorized employee may be an employee assigned to perform the work or assigned to provide the energy control and isolation function  Recommends that OSHA modify the definition for a line clearance tree trimmer to add the word qualified resulting in the complete designation as a qualified line clearance tree trimmer Recommends that OSHA modify the definition of qualified employee" to remove the word construction from the definition since it is felt that knowledge of construction procedures is beyond the scope of the proposed rule resulting in APPA's new A2-18 I 


wording as follows more knowledgeable in operation and hazards associated with electric power generation transmission and/or distribution equipment Recommends that OSHA add a definition for the word practicable and replace the word feasible with practicable wherever it appears in the proposed regulations and that practicable be further defined as capable of being accomplished by reasonably available and economic means OTHER ISSUES Clothing OSHA requested comments on the advisability of adopting requirements regarding the clothing worn by electric utility industry employees EEI has presented comments which indicates research is underway prior to establishing a standard for clothing to be worn by electric utility employees However EEI's position is that this standard has not developed to the extent that it could be included in the OSHA Rules Both APPA and EEI state that they would support a requirement that employers train employees regarding the proper type of clothing to wear to minimize hazards when working in the vicinity of exposed energized facilities Grandfathering Due to the anticipated cost impact on the utility industry of the proposed Rules requiring that existing installations be brought to the requirements of the proposed Rules both APPA and EEI propose that the final Rules include an omnibus grandfather provision This provision would exempt those selected types of facilities from modification to meet the new rules EEI states that if the grandfathering concept is incorporated that electric utility employees will not be deprived of proper protection They propose that employers be required to provide employees with a level of protection equivalent to that which the standard would require in those instances in which the utility does not choose to modify existing facilities to comply with the final standard Rubber Sleeves OSHA requests comments from the industry on whether it would be advisable to require rubber insulating sleeves when gloves are used on lines or equipment energized at more than a given voltage EEI states its position that utilities should continue to have the option of choosing rubber gloves or gloves and sleeves to protect employees when it is necessary to work closer to energized lines than the distances specified in the clearance tables Preemuting State Laws EEI requests that the final Rules be clear in their preempting state rules applicable to the operation and maintenance work rules for electric power systems. This is especially critical since some states now have existing laws which are more stringent than the proposed OSHA Rules Examples are 1 in California and Pennsylvania where electric utility linemen are prohibited from using rubber gloves to work on lines and equipment energized at more than certain voltages and 2 in California and Connecticut where the live line bare hand method of working on high voltage transmission systems is prohibited One utility Pacific Gas  Electric has obtained a variance from the California OSHA to perform live line bare-hand transmission maintenance work on an experimental basis Coiiflicts Between the Rilles and Part 1926 Subpart V Since many of the work procedures in construction work and operation and maintenance work are similar and difficult to distinguish between EEI requests that the final order be clear in establishing which rule has jurisdiction over such similar work areas A2-19 v 


IMPACTS ON COSTS AND ASSOCIATED BENEFITS In its introduction to the proposed rules OSHA has provided an estimate of the annual cost impact on the electric utility industry for the proposed des of approximately 20.7 million OSHA estimates that compliance with this proposed standard would annually prevent between 24 and 28 fatalities and 2,175 injuries per year The utilities which have responded to this proposed standard through their respective associations have questioned the claims both of the magnitude of the cost involved and the benefit to the industry in preventing fatalities and lost-time injuries Both EEI and APPA feel that the annual cost which OSHA estimates are significantly lower than would be realized in practice Factors which APPA and EEI feel were not properly addressed include the following OSHA has not accurately accounted for cost of potential retroactive impacts including retrofitting and modifying existing installations and equipment OSHA has not consistently implemented performance based provisions in proposed rules  many portions require specific approaches which would require utilities to replace procedures already in place with new procedures Estimates were based on an average size investor-owned utility of 2,800 employees and an average rural cooperative of 56 employees, which are not applicable to many smaller systems such as municipal systems OSHA has not adequately addressed the retraining which would be necessary with modifying long-established industry practices to be in accordance with the OSHA rules EEI claims that OSHA's proposed clearance requirements would not allow the use of established maintenance techniques for maintaining high voltage transmission systems and thus would require new techniques For an example of the cost which is estimated to be experienced as a result of the new Rules one of the EEI member companies has estimated that approximately 20,000 transmission towers would need to be modified to accommodate the required step bolts in the Rules at an estimated cost of 6,200,000 Additionally this same company estimates that the annual cost of retesting live line tools for its estimated 1,000 tools would be 265,000 Additionally, both EEI and APPA question the additional benefits which OSHA claims would result from implementation of the new Rules APPA questions the estimates of preventing an additional 24 to 28 fatalities annually and 2,175 injuries per year in that it fails to account for the fact that the industry has already implemented in large part safety measures which are incorporated in the Rules EEI and APPA also point out that many preventable injuries cannot be eliminated despite work rules enforcement and safety awareness campaigns since many such accidents which result in fatalities are due to employee being trained but not following the employer's training and policies PRESENT STATUS OF RULES According to information received from the OSHA office in February 1993 the final Rules are to be published no later than July 1993 and possibly as soon as March 1993 OSHA closed their receipt of comments in March 1991 and no further changes in the rules are thought possible A2-20 


CONCLUSION The OSHA 1910.269 which proposes to cover electric utility operation and maintenance work rules affects a multitude of working procedures as are summarized in this paper It is not possible at the present time to assess the final structure of the Rules as may be proposed in 1993 or subsequent years Since the comments from the utility associations APPA and EEI were made following the initial release of the proposed OSHA Rules in 1989 a significant amount of time has elapsed where other events have occurred which may affect the form of the final Rules The 1993 NESC went into effect in August 1992 and includes some of the requirements to which the commenters objected For example a significant requirement in the Part 4 of the 1993 NESC requires that rubber gloves be utilized on exposed energized parts of facilities operating at 50 to 300 volts This requirement is in conflict with EEl\222s proposed change to the OSHA Rules which would still allow working such secondary facilities without the use of rubber gloves Electric utilities are advised to review the January 31 1989 proposed operation and maintenance Rules as summarized in this paper and to review their procedures which would be affected by application of the Rules Many of the procedures proposed in the Rules provide valuable guidance in electric utilities\222 operation and maintenance activities Where the cost impact is not significant, it is recommended that utilities consider implementing such procedures in expectation of the Rules being published in the next few months Also it would be appropriate for electric utilities to review the 1993 edition of the NESC since there are portions of the Rules which have resulted in changes in the NESC These changes mainly occur in Part 4 Rules for the Operation of Electric Supply and Communications Lines and Equipment The concerns which the commenters have addressed regarding the cost impact and the resulting benefits experienced as a result of the promulgation of the Rules are real ones and must be addressed in the final Rules As a result this paper cannot present a conclusion regarding the full impact of the Rules The development of such Rules continue to be an ongoing matter and will undoubtedly require later analysis when the final rules are published A2-21
