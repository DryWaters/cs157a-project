INTRODUCTION \nThe world of the Internet has approached a historic turning-\npoint where mobile platforms and applications are poised to \nreplace the fixed host/server model that has dominated since its \ninception. Video streaming over the Internet is one of the most \nimportant applications and 3D video streaming is expected to \nbecome even more popular than 2D multimedia applications. \nContinuous feedback on perceived quality of streaming videos \nis likely to be a major determining factor in the success of \nfuture multimedia applications. \nRecently standardized wireless systems like the latest \nIEEE 802.11 standards, WiMAX or Third Generation \nPartnership Project \(3GPP LTE LTE-A transmission of multimedia \ndata with high bandwidth requirements, but the nature of \nwireless technology characteristics of the transmission \nchannels nProviders. Satisfaction of the customer needs more than mere \nnetwork performance, classified by QoS parameters like delay, \njitter, packet loss and throughput. The enhanced level of vision \nquality perceived by end users – known as Quality of \nExperience \(QoE Internet has generated significant \namount of research work, mostly aiming to overcome current \nlimitations of existing network architectures, involving content \nand service mobility, introducing new forms of 3D content nprovisioning, etc. More research topics focus on the close link \nbetween QoE and QoS [1-4] and the evaluation of \nstereoscopic images [5][6], but deeper investigations are \nneeded for appropriate QoE provisioning in wireless networks. \nThe assessment of QoE in multimedia services can be \nperformed either by subjective or objective methodologies [7]. \nSubjective quality is the users’ perception of service quality \n\(ITU-T P.800 8] which is in fact the most reliable method, \nbut requires time, money, human observers and controlled test nenvironments. Objective measurements can be performed in \nan intrusive or nonintrusive way. Full reference and reduced \nreference video quality measurements are both intrusive. \nQuality metrics such as Peak-Signal-to-Noise-Ratio \(PSNR Structural Similarity Metric reference metrics. VQM and PEVQ are \ncommercially used and are publicly unavailable [9]. \nOur previous research efforts in the area were focusing on \nexperiments based on subjective evaluation of 3D video nstreams, where 50 participants observed QoE changes due to \nthe degradation of QoS parameters. The results of this \nexperiment are published in [10]. We followed up on our \nexperiments with more subjective quality tests focusing on \nthroughput degradation by bandwidth limitation [11]. \nThis contribution is publishing new results of subjective \ntests with full-reference method carried out by 90 participants \nfocusing on describing the relationship between QoE and QoS \ndegradation, combined with Wi-Fi TX-Power alteration for \n3D contents delivery in a real home network scenario, where \nthe network was a representative combination of a GPON-\nbased transport network and IEEE 802.11n standard based Wi-\nFi access at customer side. Since communication security and \nauthenticity are frequent requirements in video streaming, \nmeasurements were made with secure HTTP live video \nstreaming traffic based on OpenVPN tunnel with same \nconditions like in case without protection investigating and \ncomparing both results. \nIvett Kulik\n†\n, Péter András Kara\n‡\n, Tuan Anh Trinh\n†\n, Lászl Bokor\n‡\n  \n* The research leading to these results has received funding from the European \nUnion's Seventh Framework Programme \([FP7/2007-2013 and Media Informatics, Budapest \nUniversity of Technology and Economics, Budapest, H-1117, Magyar tudósok nkörútja 2, Hungary, {kulik, trinh}@tmit.bme.hu \n‡ Department of Networked Systems and Services, Budapest

Expectations may \nindeed influence evaluation [12], so we intended to extend our \ninvestigation with this understudied topic. We analyzed the \npossible distortion phenomena through Level of \nComprehension \(LoC  knowledge \nand experience determines the usage of the available \ninformation.  \nThe paper is structured as follows. In Section II the \nnetwork environment is explained. Section III describes the \nmethod of the performed measurements. Section IV discusses \nresults. Finally, the paper is concluded by Section V. \nII. THE NETWORK ENVIRONMENT \nThe appropriate test network topology \(Fig. 1 transport network which was \nefficient with 2.5 Gbit/s download speed and 1.5 Gbit/s upload \nspeed [14] via broadband and responsible to provide access to \na Linux OS video server with 3D multimedia streams on the nservice provider side. The HTTP output was generated by \nVLC v1.1.3 program [15] on the video server. The MS nWindows OS based client on the customer side through the \nWi-Fi Access Point \(ASUS WL-500W live \nvideo streaming via channel 9. Videos were displayed on \nNvidia Vision Player v1.7.5 [16]. Background traffic was not \npresent on the wired network, neither on the Wi-Fi sub-\nnetwork, but communication on channel 9 could be influenced \nby interferences via channel 7 and channel 11. Since only \ndownstream traffic mattered in this case, interference of \nchannel 11 rather appeared to be disturbance from background \ntraffic, even though no background traffic was actually \npresent. \n \n \nFig. 1.

The hardware configuration of the server and the client \nare shown in TABLE I. The Wi-Fi transport and transport on \nneighbouring channels was monitored by CommView for \nWiFi v6.3 program [18]. Other APs and computers were \nconnected only to channel 7 and 11 in the building during the \nmeasurement. Channel 7 did not carry any traffic but data \ntransport existed on channel 11 during the measurement. \n \nTABLE I.

They had to fulfil queries gathering information on \nname, age, gender, being spectacled or not, and existence of \nprior 3D movie experience. Information on their acceptance of \n3D technology was provided by scoring with integers in the nrange of 1 to 10 and was used in correlation with 3D \nexperience \(Q3 THE INVESTIGATED 3D VIDEO \nVideo codec Frame size \nVideo \nbit rate \nVideo \nframe rate \nAudio \ncodec \nAudio nbit rate \nXviD \n\(MPEG-4 was carried out. \nParticipants, 90 persons \(77 men, 13 women, 38 wearing \nglasses, with the average age of 23.5 approximately 1 minute  features of which are shown in \nTABLE II.

Comparisons were \napplied to both groups of participants with the purpose of nobserving relationships between the results of the two groups. \nAs it has been stated earlier, the reference test case, which \nwas defined to be 10 on a scale of 10, was included as test \ncase 9 \(see test TABLE III is exciting to see how it \nobtained 8.64 in case of Group A, and even though \nparticipants of Group B were aware of test case parameters, \nthey assessed it with a mean score of 9.24 \(see TABLE V TEST CASES OF THE MEASUREMENT \nG \nAspect of \nInvestigation \nTest  \ncases \nOther parameters \n1 \nSecurity \n\(No Yes TX-P=71mW;BW.lim=NO;Jitter=60ms;PL=2% \n12-16 TX-P=71mW;BW.lim=YES;Jitter=0ms;PL=0% \n2 \nTX-Power \n\(71,35,251mW n9-17-19 Sec=NO;BW.lim=NO; Jitter=0ms; PL=0% \n4-18-20 Sec=NO;BW.lim=NO; Jitter=30ms; PL=1% \n3 \nJitter \n\(0, 30 60ms TX-P=71mW;Sec=NO; BW.lim=NO; PL=2% \n12-6-11 TX-P=71mW;Sec=NO; BW.lim=YES;PL=0% \n4 \nBandwidth \nlimitation  \n\(No Yes TX-P=71mW;Sec=NO; Jitter=0ms; PL=0% \n \nDetails regarding Wi-Fi parameters \(e.g., channel traffic introduced briefly in this paper.

In the secure \ncases \(Security=1 between the video server and the \nclient by the certificate with signature algorithm SHA1.

This is caused by the \n3D visualization itself; presence of depth leads to visual nfatigue and eyes strain, which prevents users from watching \n3D content for a long time. This directly affects users’ \nperception and QoE. It needs to be noted that the evaluation of \nISBN 978-1-4673-5256-7/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 272\na single participant was removed from the final set of results \n\(originally 91 participants to the inability to watch the \nselected 3D content. Although this measurement was also \ncompleted and every aspect of every test case was evaluated, \nthe given scores were usually 1. \n \n \nFig. 2. Evaluation of the worst test cases: TC 7-15 \nThe worst test case evaluation results of Group A and B \nare demonstrated by Fig 2. Here neither audio nor video was \nenjoyable. Overlapping got more serious and some scenes \nwere frozen during streaming with video shifting downwards. \nIn case of Group B, transmission received slightly lower nscores, but still 0.90 Confidence Intervals were overlapping. \nWhen we compare the best TC and the worst TC by individual \naspects \(Q1-Q5 


video streaming, 3D \nexperience was evaluated with the lowest value due to some \nhuman aspects which were explained above. However, during \nthe worst case, where some scenes were frozen and video was \nshifting downwards, the aspect of continuity \(Q1 Q5 In \ncase of QoS degradation, continuity was the most relevant \nfeature. Security had only an irrelevant impact to the \nperceptible quality. \nB. Wi-Fi TX-Power Aspect \nAnother important issue is the impact of Wi-Fi ncharacteristics on QoE measurement results. Our investigation \nwas focusing on the IEEE 802.11n standard based 2.4GHz \nband communication Wi-Fi TX-Power changing, while other \nparameter values were not directly modified during the tests. \nDistance between the AP and PC client was fixed 4m during \nthe entire measurement nCommView for Wi-Fi monitoring was used for gathering \nand analysis network packets of wireless 802.11n network. \nChannel 9 was solely used for video streaming; it was not used \nfor any other communication, since any communication on \nchannel could have influenced channel 9 data carrying. \nChannel 7 was not monitored due to the lack of traffic. Traffic \nwas monitored on channel 11. Measurements were carried out \nby the AP default TX-Power \(71mW 35mW 251mW mean QoE by the gathered participants \nrating. \nTABLE VI.

That could easily imply that the awareness \nof environmental information caused no significant alteration \nof evaluation. Before jumping to such conclusions, let us \nexamine the matter at hand from a different point of view. \nBy dividing the participants of Group B into subclasses, \nbased on their prior technical knowledge and experience, we \nshall see how the environmental information affected each \nlevel of LoC separately. For this purpose, we distinguished \nthree different levels \(?1, 0 and +1 number \ndenotes a higher level. Matching participants with their most \nrelevant LoC levels was performed by 


recorded conversations, \nin which a set of questions related to the background of the \nconcerned technologies and solutions was asked. In the final \nresult set, the group consisted of 34 participants instead of 35, \ndue to the exclusion of the previously mentioned test subject. \nThe evaluation scores of 11 participants represent level ?1 and \n+1, and level 0 is represented by 12. \nTest cases regarding the alteration of TX-Power, jitter and \nbandwidth limitation generally present similar relations \ncompared to the mean results in case of all three LoC levels. \nThe word limitation commonly depicted a negative effect on \nthe experienced quality resulting according evaluation. \nHowever, certain participants belonging to level 0 and ?1 \nscored in the opposite direction, since some of them thought \nthat bandwidth is a parameter similar to jitter and packet loss \nin effect, thus the limitation of such parameter should be \nadvantageous. An interesting idea regarding TX-Power was \nthat it is similar to sound volume in some manners; too high is \njust as unfavourable as too low. There were a few of course \nwho deemed TW-Power to be prejudicial, but their evaluation \ndid not have a weighty effect on the mean score. \nThe most interesting and noteworthy outcome of the LoC \nbased separation is obviously the set of results regarding \nsecurity presence \(see Figure 4 evaluation performed by Group A, secure transmission \nreceived slightly lower scores compared to the unprotected \ncounterparts. However, unlike the other parameters presented \nin this section, the ideas regarding security diverged much \nmore; the total magnitude of opposing evaluation was high \nenough to invert relations on the echelon of mean results. \n \n \nFig. 4. Evaluation of security test case pairs, separated by LoC \(dark blue \nbars represent secure test cases and their counterparts are in light blue 978-1-4673-5256-7/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 274\nThe majority of LoC level ?1 and some of level 0 were \ninfluenced by the notion that the presence of security shall \nenable a higher level of service quality through its protective \nnature. Yet there were indeed barely noticeable differences in \nfavour of the unprotected test cases. The participants of all nthree LoC levels experienced the same audiovisual quality; \nstill the direction of evaluation is clearly the opposite. \nThe occurrence of this distortion phenomenon was made \npossible by the socio-psychological theory of cognitive \ndissonance [21]. Its purpose is to eliminate dissonant states of \ncognitions. The two conflicting cognitions involved in this \ncase are perception \(what the user actually experiences npreconception \(prior expectations towards quality to be slightly \nbetter, but on the other hand, preconception suggests that those \nshould provide a lower level of quality compared to what \nsecured test cases have to offer, due to the lack of security. \nWhile perception is considered to be rather objective, \npreconception is much more subjective and personal, since \nexpectation itself is a mental product. Dissonance reduction \ngives preference to personal cognitions, so in this case it is \nfavourable to support preconceptions. Post-decision \ndissonance also played a role in forming these results. In order \nto justify previously upheld preconceptions and to maintain \nconsistency among decisions evaluators tend to get attached \nto preconceptions once supported. \nIt also needs to be noted that the evaluation of participants \nbelonging to LoC level +1 is distorted as well to some extent. \nIn their case, the common idea regarding security presence \nwas the extra resources required to implement secure \ntransmission which should decrease performance. This can \neasily alter barely noticeable differences to become clearly nnoticeable, resulting greater differences in scores. \nV. CONCLUSION \nThe paper has given a detailed insight into the relationship \nbetween user experience and specific network parameters. \nQoE was affected only irrelevantly by the presence of security \nduring transmission, but its combination with the degradation \nof QoS parameters – like jitter and packet loss – spectacularly \ndeteriorated continuity and 3D experience. It was proven that \npower efficiency can be achieved without notable degradation \nof service performance; default transmission power in home \nand small office networks is not required to maintain \nacceptable quality, given that no other channel interferes and \nthe amount of background traffic is infinitesimal compared to \nvideo streaming. \nIt has also been presented how cognitive dissonance played \na role during evaluation Preconceptions based on information \nregarding the given service were compelling enough to have \ntheir evident effect on the mean scores of specific participants, \ndistinguished by Level of Comprehension. \nUnlike this subjective assessment of quality, we aim to \nfocus our future work on objective evaluation, in order to \nstudy the link between subjective and objective approaches. \nAutomated solutions also exclude errors of the human factor; \ndistortions in evaluation which are naturally present, as seen in \nthe paper. \nREFERENCES \n[1] P Casas, P.

form of Saturday afternoon\ncharity activities and Halloween festivities of the Western\nworld and beyond. It is also illustrative of the attention\neconomy, the growth and diminution of audiences and the\nchurn in platforms as site populations develop, change and, in\ncertain cases, falter. Web presences on social platforms offer\nencouragement to users to become involved with the initiative,\nand as such they are examples of grassroots marketing.\nHowever, we should also note that the conceptual shifts\nin evidence may well be the result not \(or not solely sceptical\nauthorities.\nMore broadly, retrospectively gauging the extent and nature\nof any event, but in particular events with decentralised\nelements in planning and development, remains a complex\nproblem, but also an important opportunity to establish a\nbasis for data-driven analysis of the prevalence, spread and\ndrivers of such initiatives. We suggest that this type of\nresearch dovetails closely not only with time-based analysis\nin epidemiology and with predictive mechanisms such as\nKalman ?lter-based prediction of the development of topics\nin social media, but also with interdisciplinary work in\nanthropology such as that of Aral et al. [24]. The in?uence\nof social network users on one another is a well-established\nresearch subject in its own right. The effect of the cultural,\nsocial and legal context in which a concept is expressed is\nequally a subject that has received and continues to receive\nconsiderable interest.\nOne problem with this approach is the need to assemble\na dataset, which, as we have seen, would in an international\nenvironment and over a lengthy time period involve extraction\nof information from a number of websites. This means that\nthe window of opportunity to complete any such research is\nin all probability limited, and that the reproducibility of that\nactivity is limited.\nAnalyzing the big-data collected across all these social\nmedias produces category/ies within which each data item\nthat can be classi?ed with connections in the knowledge\nstructure related concepts. Looking at these knowledge\nstructures and the structural relationship between the existing\nconcepts, the context domain creates an ‘ontology’ [25].\nHowever, the role of social networks in concept classi?cation\nhas shown that variations are weakly visible in the data\nwhen evaluating terminology taken from social websites.\nAlso reaching an agreement about the actual ontological\nrelationships can take many rounds of iterations [26].\nVI. CONCLUSION\nLooking at multiple social networks, we have collected\nlarge amounts of data for the purpose of data analysis. We\nmay choose to evaluate this data either from a philosophical\nor statistical perspective, or through combination of the\nidenti?ed approaches. Therefore we have chosen to use\na Bayesian statistical reasoning technique to evaluate the\nprobability of occurrence and reasoning behind participation\nor staging, for these ?ash events.\nWe conclude that social network-based data collection is\na useful approach for the analysis of ‘long-tail’ phenomena\nwhere the distribution of many values are far from the mean.\nWhilst a longitudinal study would be of bene?t if achievable,\nwe concede that practical limitations will in many cases limit\nresearchers to post-hoc studies. In this instance we suggest\nthat a retrospective cross-sectional approach can usefully be\nsupplemented with additional social data sources in order to\nlimit the impact of noise and to mitigate the effect of small\nsample sizes.\n458\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank Gregory J.

This is because the \ntime in preparation may be very low while the time in space \nmay be very long. If the preparation period will be less than \nseveral weeks then sampling frequency should be ncontinuous or as continuous as feasible . If the preparation \nperiod for launch will occur over many weeks then the \nsampling frequency can be reduced to once/hour. \nIn general, the shorter the preparation time for launch the \nhigher the data sampling frequency is required. Preferably, \nprelaunch activity biological diagnostic data should be \nrecorded continuously and the data available for merging \nwith launch and on-orbit data. After a person initially \narrives in space, the sampling frequency should be \ncontinuous or near continuous . After the person has been in \nspace for several weeks, the sampling frequency can be \nreduced to once/hour. If a person is in space for several \nmonths, the sampling frequency can be reduced to as little \nas once/6 hours . \nTable 2.

Table 2 defmes the telemetry measurement \nsamples per measurement needed to predict mental illness \nfrom each of the different phases that data is generated and \nmade available for processing for completing prognostic \nanalysis during space exploration. This infonnation will be \nused to create a baseline behavior for comparison with \nactual data to discriminate between nonnal and abnormal nbehavior. \nTable 3 is a list of biological diagnostic measurements to be \nincluded in CCSDS telemetry available for ground \npersonnel to complete a prognostic analysis used to predict \nmental illness would be occurring in the near future.

CONCLUSION \nA prognostic and health management \(PHM industry telemetry to collect, store and distribute \nto remote locations the biological, diagnostic information \nfor process for predicting mental illness using with \npredictive algorithms .  The predictive algorithms are often \nproprietary and must be developed for use with aerospace \ntelemetry to compensate for the many shortcomings and \ncomplexities of CCSDS telemetry to be accurate and \nreliable. Our proprietary predictive algorithms were \npioneered on the Air Force's GPS satellites and Atlas launch \nvehicles over 30 years ago. They have also been \nsuccessfully used on other military, NASA and commercial \nsatellites, launch vehicles and missiles to illustrate the \npresence of accelerated aging in normal appearing \nequipment telemetry from completely normal behaving \nequipment. \nA behavior of a person ' s  FOFR can explain the cause ntreatment and the cure for mental illness .  The chemicals \n1 8  \nreleased by the FOFR when activated were developed by the \nFOFR to be in the body an extremely short duration. \nToday's  lifestyle has forced people to remain in threatening \nsituations forcing the presence of the toxic chemicals used \nby the FOFR for self preservation to be present for many \nyears at varying levels. The chemicals released by the FOFR \nand release of chemicals that are created as a result of the \nrelease of adrenaline and cortisol cause accelerated aging on \nthe entire body including all areas of the brain. When the \nFOFR is damaged from accelerated aging, it forces the \nbrain 's  chemistry to be altered by changing the ratios of \nthree main chemicals very, causing mental illness .  All the \nmedications used in mental health treat only the symptoms \nof mental illness and do not cure it. \nThe identification of accelerated aging in biological, \ndiagnostic telemetry can be used by ground personnel to \npredict the mental illness in personnel to be used for deep \nspace missions. The model of the brain' s  FOFR subsystem \nprovides the information necessary for the ground crew to \npredict and thus prevent mental illness from occurring by \nmaking the changes to the person ' s  environment. The PHM \nuses information obtained from a variety of mission phases \nincluding pre-launch readiness, launch and during deep nspace travel to develop baseline behavior from which \nmental illness can predicted so it can be prevented nREFERENCES \n[ 1 ] .

specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
