Where r  r  x  y  t   is the density of traf\002c u  u  x  y  t   is the velocity r j  m  t  and u j  m  t  represent the local density and the local velocity of the quadrilateral lattice  j  m  on the 2D multi-lane plane at time t  respectively D t is the delay time r 0 is the average density of the current segment The function V is the optimal velocity and described by the following formula V

l   It's a constant and determined by n  r c is the inverse of the safety distance and v max is the maximum traf\002c velocity for the current segment W e use a 002nite difference method to solve our model by discretizing traf\002c 003ow to some certain directions along lanes changing to the left  right neighboring lanes Then 002rstly we determine the direction of 003ow We take into account of various lane-changing constraints such as particles kinematic and dynamic constraints local 003ow densities road structures and so on For a given lattice near road inhomogeneities if it satis\002es all lane-changing constraints to the right  left front direction its 003ow will go into the right/left neighboring lane Otherwise the 003ow direction remains unchanged Secondly we update the value of traf\002c 003ow velocities and densities and determine durations of 003ow interactions according the 002nite difference equations In order to simplify solving processes we estimate whether the lattice satis\002es all these constraints by solving whether there is a satis\002ed lane-changing trajectory for the particle that has a lanechanging request in the lattice This also facilitates the further visual display because the calculated lane-changing trajectories are physically reasonable 3 E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS We implement our model for traf\002c simulations with various challenging scenarios such as traf\002c jams onand off-ramps road interactions etc Figure 1 We next give the similarity comparisons with real traf\002c data and the computational ef\002ciency of our model 3.1 Similarity We simulate the traf\002c of Highway 101 from X  420m to X  620m in 15 minutes Our initial and boundary conditions of the simulations are from the NGSIM W e calculate the 003ux e very 15s among 1000s from our simulation results and compare the time-series data with the NGSIM data using LCSS algorithm The similarity between the NGSIM data and our simulation results as well as the similarity of the model described by Sewall et al are shown in Table 1 3.2 Computational ef\002ciency We use the road networks with the length of 150km There are 65 road inhomogeneity segments in the traf\002c networks accounting for about 20 of the total length Figure 2 shows the relationship between total compute time and the number of vehicles What can be seen in Figure 2 is that both the compute time of the 1D CDLH model and that of our model are nearly independent of the number of vehicles 4 C ONCLUSION There are mainly two advantages over previous virtual traf\002c methods Firstly we describe traf\002c 003ow along lanes and 003ow interactions between lanes in a uniform continuum frame and blend lanechanging constraints considering the particularity of traf\002c 003ow Table 1 Similarity of the 003ux sequence for successive detection points along the Highway 101 The average row shows the average similarities of the sample points for each technology The closer that the similarity value is to 1 the more realistic that the simulation result is Figure 2 The compute time as a function of the number of vehicles As a result 003ow interactions could be described in detail in a macroscopic method We also get realistic lane-changing trajectories when blending the constraints so that lane-changing processes could be directly displayed to enhance the effect of large-scale virtual traf\002c Secondly we creatively integrate the lane-changing constraints and contribute an ef\002cient algorithm to solve the model The compute time of our model owns the same order as that of the 1D CDLH model which makes our model ef\002cient for a large-scale traf\002c simulation There are also some limitations A few collisions between particles may be unavoidable in lane-changing processes because the lane-changing trajectories we calculate are a kind of forecast of next several time steps We will further improve it by more accurate ways A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work is supported and funded by the
