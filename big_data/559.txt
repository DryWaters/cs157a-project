We run experiments on\na large dataset and demonstrate a 75% reduction in workload\nsize while retaining at least 90% of malicious URLs.\nExisting methods do not scale well with the hundreds of\nmillions of URLs encountered every day as the problem is\na heavily-imbalanced, large-scale binary classi?cation problem.\nOur proposed method is able to handle nearly two million URLs\nin less than ?ve minutes. We generate two ?ltering models by\nusing lexical features and descriptive features, and then combine\nthe ?ltering results. The on-line learning algorithms are applied\nhere not only for dealing with large-scale data sets but also for\n?tting the very short lifetime characteristics of malicious URLs.\nOur ?lter can signi?cantly reduce the volume of URL queries\non which further analysis needs to be performed, saving both\ncomputing time and bandwidth used for content retrieval.\nIndex Terms—Data Mining Machine learning, Information\nSecurity, Information Filtering\nI. INTRODUCTION\nMalicious URLs have become a common channel to facil-\nitate Internet criminal activities such as drive-by-download,\nspamming and phishing Many attackers try to use these web\nsites for spreading malicious programs or stealing identities.\nKaspersky Lab [14] reports that browser-based attacks in 2012\nincreased from 946,393,693 to 1,595,587,670 and 87.36%\nof these used malicious URLs. The Anti-Phishing Working\nGroup \(APWG  using\nmalicious URLs increased from 93,462 to 123,486 in the\nsecond half of 2012. Of the millions of URLs used each\nday less than 0.01% are malicious and furthermore they are\nshort-lived in order to avoid blacklist blocking. There is an\nurgent need to develop a mechanism to detect malicious URLs\nfrom the high volume, high velocity and high variety data.\nMany information security companies and organizations offer\nmalicious URL detection including Google’s safe browsing [9]\nand Trend Micro’s web reputation services [16].\nThe blacklist is a general solution for protecting users from\nthe malicious web sites, examples include PhishTank 18],\nSORBS [2] and URIBL [3]. These services provide a list\nof malicious web sites reported by volunteers or collected\nby web crawlers and veri?ed by some reliable back-end\nsystem. The content-based analysis service BLADE [1] is\nalso a well known solution for detecting malicious web sites.\nThey download the web page content and analyze it for\nmalicious content. To download the content for analyzing is\ntime consuming and consumes bandwidth. Therefore content-\nbased analysis services will be integrated with a blacklist or\na cache mechanism to optimize the performance and avoid\nre-analyzing the same URL. However, content-based analysis\nmethods are not a practical solution for the large volume of\nURLs and the speed at which new URLs can be created We\npropose a ?ltering mechanism to be used before the content-\nbased analysis to remove the bulk of benign URLs, reducing\nthe volume of URLs on which content-based analysis needs\nto be performed. This job is just like nding a needle in a\nburning haystack because of the following challenges:\n• Large scale: the service provider averagely receives sev-\neral million URLs every hour\n• Extremely imbalanced data set: the malicious URLs are\nonly around 0.01% of the total received URLs\n• Sparse data set: the lexical features give us a very sparse\ndata set\nTo meet the goal of reducing the great amount of URL\nqueries, the ?ltration system should be able to work in real-\ntime and achieve a high detection rate with a tolerable false\nalarm rate. The system should also be able to update the\nmodel using the feedback of the content-based analysis system.\nIn this paper, we introduce a framework to ?lter the non-\nsuspicious URLs using only features extracted from the URL\nstring. We set the ?ltration as a binary classi?cation problem.\nThe proposed framework combines lexical information and\nstatic characteristics of URL strings together for classi?ca-\ntion. We evaluate our framework using a real-world data set,\nwhich is a large-scale and extremely imbalanced data set. Our\nframework can ?lter out 75% of URLs, which are regarded\nas benign. The remaining 25% suspicious URLs cover around\n90% of the malicious ones. Our framework does not use a\nnetwork query or web page contents. All the features are\ndirectly extracted from the URL string, so our URL ?ltering\nsystem can work ef?ciently. More speci?cally, our system\nupdates the model with one million of URLs in less than ?ve\nminutes. The prediction process of our system is also ef?cient;\none million URLs can be classi?ed in less than two minutes.\nII. RELATED WORK\nGarera et al. [8] designed 18 hand-selected features to\nclassify phishing web sites, such as page rank information and\n2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data\n978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 589\nthe period of accessible time. The 18 hand-selected features\nare very similar to our static characteristic features, but these\nfeatures still need to query information from the network.\nOur work extracts the static characteristic 


features only from\nthe URL string and gives a well representation to distinguish\nbenign and suspicious URLs.\nThe work by Ma et al. [13] is the most popular research on\nmalicious web site in recent years. They utilize the blacklist,\nhost-based information and lexical information of URLs to\nbuild different feature sets In order to handle large-scale data\nsets, they use an online learning algorithm and compare the\nperformance with a batch learning algorithm. The results of\ntests on a data set spanning 100 days are promising. We\nstudy their lexical features and adapt them to our own. Le et\nal. [11] present a modi?ed version of the method proposed\nby Ma et al. by using another online learning algorithm.\nThey merge the study from Garera et al. to improve the\ndetection performance. Thomas et al. [20] design a framework\nto extract lexical, host-based and page content information\nas features and implement their idea on a cloud computing\nplatform. This framework is tested on a data set of spam\nmessages gathered from Twitter and e-mail. The result shows\nthe framework achieves high performance at little cost. Pao\net al. [19] proposed using a Kolmogorov complexity-based\nmeasure to detect malicious URLs. They adopt a compression\nmethod to approximate Kolmogorov complexity, and used the\napproximation as a signi?cant feature for detection. Unlike\ntheir goal of detecting malicious URLs, our work focuses\non ?ltering the large amount of URLs to pick up the most\nsuspicious ones. We use the decision value of the online\nmodel to quantify if a URL is suf?ciently suspicious to justify\ndownloading the linked content for analysis.\nBlum et al. [5] have proposed a similar idea. They try to\navoid network queries to reduce processing time, and also\nchoose a con?dence-weighted algorithm for lexical informa-\ntion features to detect phishing sites. Different from them,\nwe focus on not only the phishing pages but also all the\nattacks over the URLs. We also evaluate our framework on\na large-scale and extremely imbalanced data set. The problem\nin the work by Whittaker et al. [21] is similar to ours in\nthat they too use an imbalanced and large-scale data set.\nThey use the information of host-based, networking, lexical\nand page content to classify web sites and automatically\ngenerate their blacklist. The framework which we proposed\ndoes not need to query the information from the network so\nour system can handle the user query in real time. Several\nprojects have also explored different ways to protect users\nfrom malicious URLs. Li et al. [12] proposed MadTracer\nwhich can automatically generate detection rules to detect\nmalicious advertising activities. Invernizzi and Comparetti 10]\npresented EVILSEED to search malicious web pages more\nef?ciently from an initial seed of known, malicious web page.\nIII. FEATURE EXTRACTION\nIn order to successfully separate benign URLs from ma-\nlicious ones, we design two feature sets to describe URLs.\nTABLE I\nCOMPONENTS OF URL\nComponent Example\nURL aneisig.es/vx/hstart.php?id=664&logon=141\nDomain Name aneisig.es\nPath vx/hstart.php\nSub-Directory vx\nFilename hstart\nFile Extension php\nArgument id=664&logon=141\nTABLE II\nTHE DELIMITERS OF URL COMPONENT\nComponent Delimiters\nDomain Name dash and slash\nPath dash, dot, underscore and back slash\nArgument ampersand and equal sign\nThese two feature sets represent the lexical information and\nsome other characteristics of URLs. The ?rst feature set which\nincludes lexical features describes the lexical information of\nURLs. The second feature set which includes descriptive fea-\ntures describes some statistical characteristics of URLs. These\ntwo feature sets represent two different natures of the URLs.\nAt the ?rst sight, we can imagine that the lexical features\nare effective for malicious URL detection by a blacklist rule.\nHowever, most of malicious web sites have a short lifetime\nand change their addresses frequently to avoid being blocked\nby the blacklist Therefore, even though the blacklist could\nbe effective for a short period of time we need to study\nsome other features that can also be effective in a long run.\nIn our opinion, the lexical features describe the dynamic\nnature of URLs by the “words” used in the URLs; while\nthe descriptive features describe the static nature of URLs\nsince the characteristics between benign and malicious URLs\nare rarely changed drastically. For example, phishing sites\noften use similar letter or symbols \(such as the lower case\nof ‘L’ and the digit ‘1 to confuse victims, therefore the\nsites may have some particular statistics about the number\nor the consecutive relationship of alphabets and digits. Some\nother malicious sites tend to have randomly chosen characters\nor characters that are less recognized as words of known\nmeanings. In summary, we believe that the lexical features\nare more effective than descriptive features, but they can\nonly work in a short period of time; on the other hand, the\ndescriptive features are less-effective than the lexical features,\nbut they may work for a longer time. In this paper, we combine\nthese two complementary feature sets which serve as two\ndifferent views to ?lter malicious URLs. Before introducing\nthe feature sets, we give a de?nition of URL components.\nWe split the URL into several components as shown in table\nI. The lexical features and descriptive features are extracted\nfrom these components. The details are described in following\nsubsections.\n590\nA Lexical Features\nThe lexical features use the bag-of-words model to describe\nURLs. We use three components for extracting lexical features:\ndomain name, path and argument. Each component is split\nby speci?c delimiters The details of delimiters are shown in\ntable II. Additionally, we use a three character length sliding\nwindow 


on the domain name for generating the ?xed length\ntokens. This method can identify a malicious website which\nsubtly modi?es its domain name.\nEach word/feature generated from URLs is stored in a\ndictionary with a speci?c index, only the same word can\nget the same index. This dictionary could be dynamically\nupdated with data streaming, but in practice the dictionary\nwould consume a large amount of memory for the words\ngenerated from millions of URLs. For this reason, we use\nfollowing methods to remove less useful words and to reduce\nmemory usage.\n1 and intuitive method.\nThe learned model of lexical features are a set of weights of\nthe extracted words \(see section IV decision. In our setting, these zero-weight words will\nbe removed from the dictionary after an updating procedure is\n?nished. If the removed word appears again in next updating\nprocedure, it will be treated as another new word. It means\nthe reappeared word will get a new index which is different\nfrom removed one.\n2 Remove argument value words: The argument value in\na URL is usually a serial number, random string or user input.\nExcept for the user input which may contain some information,\nthe words generated from the serial number and random strings\nare meaningless. These words will consume much memory\nbut provide no help for classifying URLs. For this reason, we\ndecide to remove all words from argument value. For example,\nin table I the argument part is “id=664&logon=141”. We\nremove the argument value “664” and “141” and are leave\nthe argument names with “id” and “logon”.\n3 their domain name. To reduce the dictionary\nsize and effectively manage these IP addresses, we use the\nmapping table from MaxMind [15] for mapping the IP address\nto an Autonomous System \(AS numbers\nuniquely identi?es a network on the Internet, therefore, the\nIP will be changed to an AS number which represents the\nnetwork which contains the IP address.\n4 expression:\nMany strings differ only in numerical values, so we replace\nall numerical values by a regular expression. For example,\nif two words are abc123 and abc789, they will be rewritten\nby the same regular expression “abc[0-9]+”. So if some words\ncontain different digit characters, they will be seen as the same\nword.\n5 word a time stamp.\nIn each training process, if a word exists in the dictionary and\noccurs again, the time stamp will be updated. If any word has\nnot been updated for 24 hours, the words will be removed\nbecause we think the words are expired.\nB. Descriptive Features\nIn descriptive features, we split the path component into\nsub-directory, ?lename and ?le extension to obtain more\ndetailed information. To accurately extract the information on\ndomain name, we remove the “www” \(and www with any\nnumber ccTLD gTLD chosen by the domain name\nowner.\nThe descriptive features represent the static characteristics\nof the URL These static characteristics are different from\nlexical features, which can be easily changed by slightly\nmodifying the characters of URLs. We studied the URLs\nof phishing and malware sites to design these descriptive\nfeatures. These features can help us to distinguish malicious\nand benign URLs. Table III shows the descriptive features,\nextracted components and dimension.\n1 URLs\ncommonly need to add some keywords in its components.\nThis action causes URLs to become noticeably lengthier.\nFor detecting this situation, we record the length of each\ncomponent. All these length values will be stored by the\nlogarithm base 10 to avoid the normalization process being\nunduly affected by the large length value.\n2 components. It can help to ?nd\nthe abnormal component. The length ratio feature uses the\nlength of URL, domain name, path and argument component.\nWe check all of the combinations of these components and\ncompute the length division as follows:\n• Domain Name divided by URL\n• Path divided by URL\n• Argument divided by URL\n• Path divided by Domain Name\n• Argument divided by Domain Name\n• Argument divided by Path\nEach pair of combination on the list contributes a descriptive\nfeature in our feature set.\n3 Digit-letter-digit: For detecting a\nphishing website masquerading as another website, we record\nthe number of occurrences of the following two patterns: a\nletter between two digits \(ex. award2o12 letters \(ex. examp1e count and Longest word length: We previously\nused delimiters to split the components in lexical features,\nnow we create a descriptive feature by counting the number\nof delimiters in each component. The length of the longest\nword after splitting is also recorded.\n5 all\ncharacters as letter, digit and symbol and tally the frequency\n591\nTABLE III\nTHE USED COMPONENT AND DIMENSION OF DESCRIPTIVE FEATURE\nURL Domain Name Path Sub-directory Filename File Extension Argument Dim.\nLength\n? ? ? ? ? ?\n6\nLength ratio\n? ? ? ?\n6\nLetter-digit-letter\n? ? ? ? ? ?\n6\nDigit-letter-digit\n

Set P \(xi component, the alphabet entropy H can be computed by\nH = ?\n25?\ni=0\nP \(xi xi x0 = a, x1 = b x25 = z tallying the number of\noccurrences of digits and dividing by the string length of URL\ncomponent. For example the number rate of “Example123”\n= 3/10 = 0.3.\n7 high\nprobability of being a malware [17]. We use a binary feature\nto represent whether the ?le extension is exe” or not. Notice\nthat we only look at the ?le extension of the URL rather than\ndownload the real ?le.\n8 Using IP as domain name and Default port number:\nMost benign URLs do not use IP address as its domain name,\nand the port number of website is usually 80. Based on these\nideas, we check if the domain name is an IP address and if\nthe port number is the default HTTP port or not.\n9 owners of\nlegitimate websites prefer to use a simple and memorable\ndomain name, even if they need to pay more money. But\nmalicious website owners frequently change the domain name\nso they are unlikely to pay more money for buying a better\ndomain name. Based on this idea, we design the character\ncontinuity rate of domain name.\nFirst we categorize the character to letter, digit and symbol.\nThe domain name will be split by the connection of different\ncharacter category, and the sum of the longest token length\nof each character type will divide by the domain length. For\nexample, the continue rate of “abc567-gt” = \(3+ 3+ 1 ONLINE LEARNING ALGORITHM\nTo meet our goal on dealing with large-scale data ef?ciently,\nwe choose to use online learning algorithms for building our\n?lters. An online learning algorithm works in rounds. For each\nround i, the algorithm receives an instance xi ? R\nd to make\nthe prediction with its model wi. And then it receives the true\nlabel yi ? {?1,+1} and suffers prediction loss \(wi; \(xi, yi the Passive-Aggressive \(PA CW models. The PA algorithm tries to modify\nthe model as little as possible to correctly classify the new\nincoming instance. This rule matches our idea of maintaining\na stable model for describing the static characteristics. The\nCW algorithm updates the weights of the model by their con-\n?dence. The weights of rarely updated features will be updated\nmore aggressively. For the lexical features, this algorithm can\nmaintain the dynamic lexical information appropriately.\nA. Passive-Aggressive Algorithm\nThe PA algorithm [6] uses the hinge loss function. For each\ninstance xi, PA will solve following optimization problem:\nwi+1 = argmin\nw?Rd\n1\n2\n?w wi?\n2\ns.t. \(w; \(xi, yi misclassi?ed. The updated model should cor-\nrectly predict xi and the difference between the old model\nand updated model should be minimized. If yi is mislabeled,\nthe PA algorithm will be updated substantially in the wrong\ndirection. To deal with this phenomenon, it can add non-\nnegative slack variable ? to this optimization problem:\nwi+1 = argmin\nw?Rd\n1\n2\n?w ? wi?\n2\n+ C?\ns.t. \(w; \(xi, yi Algorithm\nCW Algorithm\nDense Feature \nExtraction\nSparse Feature \nExtraction\nMalicious URL Filter\nDense Model nThreshold\nSparse Model & \nThreshold\nFig. 1.

OUR PROPOSED FRAMEWORK\nOur goal is to construct a front-end system, which can\nautomatically ?lter out 75% of URLs queried and pass 75% or\nmore malicious URLs to the back-end system. In other words,\nwe want to reduce the loading of the back-end system down to\n25% while ensuring that at most 25% of genuinely malicious\nURLs are dropped.\nWe use the CW algorithm as the learner of lexical features,\nbecause the nature of lexical information is similar to Natural\nLanguage Processing \(NLP because PA-I can make sure that the\nmodel is modi?ed within a limited range in each round. The\nPA-I is suitable for descriptive features, because the descriptive\nfeatures represent the static characteristics of the URL and so\nits weights should not be changed greatly.\nIn the training/updating process \(see Figure 1 system\nreceives the URL instances and its label, each instance will\nbe processed to compute both a lexical feature vector and a\ndescriptive feature vector. The descriptive feature vectors are\nnormalized by min-max normalization using min/max values\nobtained from the ?rst training set. After feature extraction,\nboth descriptive feature and lexical feature vectors are sent\nto corresponding learning modules for updating the model.\nFor dealing with the extremely imbalanced data, we use\nthe over-sampling technique to make sure the characteristics\nof malicious URLs are learned by both ?lters. During the\ntraining/updating process, each benign instance will follow a\nrandomly picked malicious instance to feed into the learners.\nThat will let both learners receive balanced data to train/update\nthe model.\nFor achieving our goal, we use the updated models to\ncompute the suspicious score of each instance. The suspicious\nscore is the decision value computed by a given model and\na predicting instance. For binary classi?cation, the classi?er\npredicts an instance as normal if the score is less than zero.\nIn our framework, we replace the zero by a threshold which\nis derived from training data. Here we de?ne a con?gurable\nparameter ? to obtain the threshold. After training, we will\nevaluate the suspicious score of all training instances and use\n? percentile to decide our threshold Namely, that ? percent of\nthe scores should be within this selected score. We set the ?\nas 85% in our framework for deriving the threshold of lexical\nand descriptive ?lter.

Prediction Performance\n?lter and lexical ?lter are independently obtained from this\nprocess and ? could be changed for different situation.\nIn the prediction process \(see Figure 2 descriptive feature vector and lexical feature\nvector \(the descriptive feature vector is normalized After\nfeature extraction, the vectors are sent to the corresponding\nmodel to estimate their suspicious score If any suspicious\nscore is greater than the threshold, the URL will be predicted\nas a suspicious URL and it should be passed to the back-end\nsystem.

It is also the rate at which content must be\ndownloaded for analysis by the back-end system. The missing\nmalicious rate is the rate of misclassi?cation of malicious\ninstances as benign URLs. The two measures can help us to\njudge the prediction performance in the extremely imbalanced\ndata set.\n2 evaluate our implemented system\nin this subsection and focus on following key points\n• Performance of our framework in large and extremely\nimbalanced data set\n• Ef?ciency of our implemented system\n• The differences between descriptive ?lter and lexical\n?lter.\na train/update our implemented ?lter, then apply the ?lter to\nclassify the next hour of data. The daily average results are\nshown in Figure 4. The download rates are steady at around\n25% and missing malicious rates at 9 or lower after the ?rst\nday. This result shows that our framework can ?lter out 75%\nURLs, and only a few malicious URLs will be lost. It is worth\nnoting that our system can achieve better performance with\na stable detection rate while the daily malicious rate rapidly\nincreased in Nov.-Dec. data set.\nTABLE V\nTHE TIME OF TRAINING PROCESS AND PREDICTION PROCESS\nApr. Sept. Nov.-Dec.\nTraining Time \(min Time \(min strings that generated in one hour on\nthree datasets. In our approach, we do not need the host-based\ninformation and the contents of web sites. Thus, we can train\nour ?ltering models with more than one million URL strings\nin 3.5 minutes including feature extraction, lexical ?ltering\nmodel and descriptive 


ltering model. We can test more than\non million URL strings in 1.5 minutes.\nc lexical ?lters: The\nprevious evaluations show our framework works well by\ncombining the prediction results of descriptive ?lter and lexical\n?lter. To evaluate the performance of each ?lter indepen-\ndently, the individual missing malicious rate is compared with\ncombined results in Figure 5. As the ?gure shows, most of\nmalicious instances are detected by lexical ?lter. Although\nthe descriptive ?lter does not work well, it can be used as\na complement to the lexical ?lter for improving performance.\nFor further understanding of the difference between the lex-\nical ?lter and descriptive ?lter, we set up another experiment\nto evaluate the stability and expiration time of models. We use\nthe data set from Sept. 14 to Sept. 19 as training data. The\ndata set from Sept. 17 to Sept. 26 is used as short-term testing\nset and the Nov.-Dec. data set is used as long-term testing\ndata. The model and threshold generated from the training data\nwere not updated during testing. Figure 6 shows the MMR of\nlexical ?lter is lower than descriptive ?lter in the short-term\n595\ntesting set. But in the Nov.-Dec. data set, the MMR of lexical\n?lter becomes to increase and unstable. Even in middle of\nDecember, the lexical ?lter misses more malicious URLs than\ndescriptive ?lter.\nBased on these results, the lexical ?lter has unstable per-\nformance over time. The model using lexical features needs\nto continually update to retain its performance. In contrast\nwith the lexical ?lter, the descriptive ?lter has long-term\neffectiveness but the detection ability is lower than the lexical\n?lter.\nVII. CONCLUSION\nWe focus on a very practical problem ef?ciently and\neffectively detecting malicious URLs. Working with a world-\nfamous information security company, the goal is to provide\nthem a ?ltering system that is able to ?lter out 75% URLs\nand the remaining portion should contain 75% of all malicious\nURLs originally present. That is, both the download rate and\nmissing malicious rate should be less than 25%. The most\nchallenging part of this problem is how to ?nd an extremely\nsmall portion of malicious URLs out of a huge volume of\nURLs being generated at high speed. The scale of the problem\nand limited processing time prohibit the solution provided\nby a conventional approach. We proposed a novel method\nthat uses the URL strings only for the detection. In the\nproposed method, we combine the lexical information and\nstatic characteristics of URL string. Without the host-based\ninformation and content-based analysis, we are able to deal\nwith two millions URL strings in ?ve minutes. Our system\nmisses less than 9% of malicious instances while only 25%\nof the data set are required detailed content-based analysis\nby the back-end system. This has surpassed the requirements\nfrom the security service provider. We also introduced an\nonline learning technique in our framework so that the ?ltering\nmodels can be modi?ed dynamically if there is any feedback\nfrom the back-end content analysis engine. Moreover, the\nonline learning mechanism also ?ts with the very short lifetime\ncharacteristic of malicious URLs. Our proposed framework\nwill signi?cantly reduce the burden of doing content-based\nanalysis and using the bandwidth for content retrieval and can\nbe combined with other web security services smoothly.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nWe thank the anonymous reviewers for their valuable\ncomments and feedback.

CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we investigate MapReduce scheduling in\nan opportunistic environment with focus on the fairness\nbetween multiple jobs. We identify several deficiencies of\nthe current fair scheduler, based on which we propose a new\nscheduler that uses the notions of fractional share and map-\nreduce correlation to incorporate dynamic node availability\ninto scheduling decisions. Our implementation in Hadoop\nverifies that the proposed scheduler can improve fairness by\nsignificantly reducing the variability in job completion times,\nachieving up to 50% better fairness in our experiments.\nREFERENCES\n[1] “Amazon EC2 Spot Instances,” aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot-instances/.\n[2] J.

introduced SALSA, an approach to automatically\nanalyze Hadoop logs to construct state-machine views of the\nplatform’s execution [25]. The derived state-machines are used\nto trace the data-flow and control-flow executions. SALSA\ncomputes the histograms of the durations of each state and uses\nthese histograms to estimate the Probability Density Functions\n\(PDFs between the PDFs across machines to detect\nanomalies. Tan et al. also compare the duration of a state\nin a particular node with its past PDF to determine if the\nduration exceeds a determined threshold and can be flagged\nas an anomaly.\nAnother related work to this paper is the approach of Xu\net al. in [26], which uses the source code to understand the\nstructure of the logs. They create features based on the constant\nand variable parts of the log messages and apply the Principal\nComponent Analysis \(PCA behaviour.\nAll the above approaches are all designed for system\nadministrators in managing their large clusters. Our approach,\non the other hand, aims to assist developers in comparing the\ndeployed system on such large clusters against the develop-\nment cloud.\nX. CONCLUSION\nDevelopers of BDA Apps typically first develop their appli-\ncation with a small sample of data in a pseudo cloud, then\ndeploy the application in a large scale cloud environment.\nHowever, the larger data and more complex environments\nlead to unexpected executions of the underlying platform.\nSuch unexpected executions and their context cannot be easily\nuncovered by traditional approaches.\nIn this paper, we propose an approach to uncover the\ndifferent behaviour of the underlying platforms for BDA Apps\nbetween runs with small testing data and large real-life data\nin a cloud environment. To evaluate our approach, we perform\na case study on Hadoop, a widely used platform, with three\nBDA Apps.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
