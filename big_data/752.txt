Traditional undersea acoustic systems focus on signal processing and track development at the single array level, resulting in reliable but very intensive methods for finding targets that are located in densely populated shipping lanes.  This process requires track associa tion between nodes, including nonlinear projections from measurement space to target space. In contrast, our appro ach fuses data from multiple nodes at the measurement \(ra 
ther than track\vel and operates directly in the target state space \(rather than measurement state space There exist a number of challenges in the problem. First, sensor data couples to the unknown target states in a non linear fashion. Second, the multi-array data is plagued by ambiguities. There are two main ambiguities present in the problem: a left-right ambiguity at each sensor node inherent to any linear array and a multi-target ambiguity caused by additional beam intersections due to the multiple targets and multiple sensors. In this paper, we describe a novel approach to combat these challenges by combining high-fidelity physics-based sensor statistical modeling, an innovative nonlinear Bayesian filter, and a unique method of handing the computational implementation Nonlinear filtering approaches to multitarget tracking have been studied extensively in the literature. The \223PDF Tracker\224 work by Bethel [2-3  gi ves a B a y e si an no nl i n e a r  
filtering approach and provides a strong theoretical basis for its viability. The seminal \223likelihood ratio tracker\224 work of Stone s a Bayesian m u ltitarget tracking method and is implemented using a discrete grid. The 223JMPD\224 approach of Kastella [5 a t ing the joint multitarget state as a single hybrid probability density \226 i.e., constructing a single probability density over both the number of targets and the states of each. Orton and Fitzgerald [9 an d Do u cet [1 0   also stud y th e m u lti targ et problem from the Bayesian pers pective has described a multitarget filter that utilizes Poisson Point Process parameterizations. The work of Bethel & Shapo [1 7] shows how these ideas can be adapted to single node passive acoustic tracking using real sensor data This work differs from earlier works as it uses the Bayesoptimal nonlinear filtering approach to perform multitarget detection and tracking in a 2D X/Y\e space \(\223target 


  2 space\224\using simultaneous measurements from multiple passive arrays In this environment, there are several challenges that require the nonlinear filter\222s generality. First, sensor measurements couple nonlinearly to the desired target state \(i.e., bearing measurements provided by passive acoustic sensors are related in a nonlinear manner to target XY position Second, using multiple bearings only sensors in a multitarget environment leads to ambiguous beam intersections and therefore a multiply peaked conditional density. Additionally, this environment provides several implementational challenges. First, due to the physics sensor resolution in X/Y is a function of target to sensor range. This makes numerical density estimation difficult Second, the tactical nature of the problem calls for a large surveillance region requiring accurate density estimation over a large state space Our proposed approach has a number of benefits over conventional methods. Most importantly, we do not employ separate filtering at each sensor node. Rather, a single Bayesian multitarget filter operates, combining all of the sensor measurements. This el iminates the need for track fusion, or association between tracks at different nodes. A cost of this approach is the bandwidth required to transfer measurements to a central fusion point. In addition, the approach fuses data at the m easurement level, which avoids the SNR losses involved in thresholding operations. These features together allow for improved detection and tracking of low SNR targets This approach requires increased computation as compared to conventional linear approaches. In contrast to linear approaches, the nonlinear appr oach estimates an entire nonparametric probability density \(although it is locally truncated K alman\proach instead needs only to estimate the mean and covariance of the density. Both methods scale linearly in target number when the targets are well separated, and superlinearly when targets are close together Other works [1 st udy t h e  computational cost for nonlinear filtering in similar settings In the experiments presented here, we track a few targets with one-second updates in real time using un-optimized MatLab code on a standard Desktop PC The rest of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 develops a high-fidelity statistical model of sensor output which is a function of array geometry, location, and spectral characteristics. The model uses element-level physics to generate a description of the final beamformed broadband data that serves as input to the tracker Section 3 reviews the Bayes optimal single target detection and tracking paradigm. In this nonlinear approach, we do not assume a parametric form for the probability density allowing us to directly incorporate sensor bearing measurements through the high fidelity sensor model. In this track-before-detect actually fuse-before-detect paradigm, both the probability of target presence and probability of target state conditioned on target presence are estimated from the measurements Section 4 describes the numerical approach, which is based on a discrete grid approximation and an efficient alternating direction implicit Fokker-Plank solver. This numerical approach is different than particle filtering [6 wh ich is a stochastic sampling based method of representing the density. The discrete grid approach has a number of benefits in the current setting, most importantly as it gives non-zero probability mass to all locations in the surveillance region The main deficiency of the fixed grid approach is wasted computations on regions of th e state space with very low mass, leading to potentially sharply increased computational demands over the particle filter ing approach, particularly in high dimensionality state spaces  Finally, Sections 5, 6, and 7 show how this approach is extended to the multitarget case. The multitarget filter builds on the Bayes optimal single target detection and tracking approach and employs a unique numerical approach based on multiple spatially overlapping discrete grids and moving tracker grids. Furthermore we describe one of the interesting features of this domain: ambiguous targets 2  P ASSIVE A COUSTIC M ODELING  To test the multi-node tracker under the most realistic conditions possible, we have generated high-fidelity broadband simulations to model input sensor data. The simulation capability is robust and flexible in terms of input parameters, allowing arbitrary node array geometry \(not necessarily linear\, non-uni form spectral characteristics e.g., to model dispersion and/or hydrophone frequency response\, and a parameterized range of target kinematics In terms of signal physics, the simulator follows the frequency-domain plane-wave approach detailed in [1  I n  this model, targets emit plan e waves that propagate in the acoustic medium and reach the array sensors. Array geometry induces prop agation delays that cause the received plane waves to have different phase characteristics at each hydrophone in the array. Exploiting this phenomenon leads to a beamformer approach to array processing, in which bearing-time displays are typi cally used to show target motion over time Fundamental to the passive sonar paradigm \(and the widely used bearing-time display\ is the frequency-bearing surface that results from processing an FFT-block of sensor data with a beamformer. Our simulator synthesizes this quantity as a function of target position and array location An example of the simulator\222s processing capabilities begins in Figure 1 


  3  Figure 1 226 Nominal Trajectory for the two simulated targets discussed below and a cartoon showing a passive node which receives acoustic energy from each  A passive node \(pictured with an array cartoon\sides along the horizontal axis, centered at \(0, 0\ and two targets traverse the region. Target traj ectories appear as a blue and a black line. From thes e trajectories, the array location, and sensor geometry we expect the target energy to be spatially separated on a bearing display Figure 2 depicts the simulated data at the output of a conventional beamformer \(\223 CBF\224\he frequencydomain CBF used here, phase rotations \(equivalent to classical time domain delay-and-sum processing plane wave inputs at each hydro phone to align in a phasecoherent way at the correct arrival angle. The equation that describes the required phase rotations comes from the array manifold vector for the array In the case of a linear array such as the one simulated here, the manifold vector takes on a simple form. For an array with N sensors, the nth component of the manifold vector is simply  1 where is the n th sensor location\nd the wavenumber  In contrast, plane wave signals do not add coherently in directions other than the true arrival angle This process repeats for every discrete frequency bin in the simulation. In the left hand panel of Figure 2, bearing is on the horizontal axis \(in discrete beams\equency \(in discrete bins\appears on the vertical. This orientation gives rise to the commonly used nomenclature \223FRAZ\224 \226 short for \223FRequency-AZimuth.\224 Bearing extends from zero degrees at the far-left si de of the image to 180 260  002 he right-hand end. Targets \(physically residing at a single bearing\ emit broadband energy across all frequencies, and the results are the vertical funnel-shaped responses indicated for both targets \(in blue and red, respectively\. The increasing spatial extent of the target energy over bearing as frequency decreases results from the poor spatial discrimination at the large acoustic wavelengths that comprise low-frequencies. In this display, Target 1 is fairly difficult to see because of its low SNR. Note that near the endfire regions \(0 260 and 180 260 ere is significant distortion  Figure 2 \226 Left: A single time snapshot of the Frequency-Azimuth \(FRAZ\ display for two targets; Right:  The associated Bearing-Time Record \(BTR 


  4 This phenomenon results from the intrinsically poor spatial resolution of linear arrays near endfire \(due to lack of physical aperture in these dir ections\The effect would be less pronounced on a cosine\(bearing\ display, but here we keep the horizontal axis in true bearing space for more flexibility with nonlinear array geometries and the 2D multiple array scenarios that are the focus of this work Omnidirectional hydrophones actually provide full 360 260  2 002 verage of the area surrounding the node. However the 0 260 180 260 region and the 180 260 360 260 are indistinguishable from the perspective of linear sensors like the one modeled here. Therefore, we have elim inated that portion of the display since it adds no new information. This phenomenon is different from the one discussed in Section 6, where ambiguities arise because true passive target bearings from multiple targets intersect in multiple places Because FRAZ images do not pr ovide integration gain over frequency or an easy way for operators to follow contacts over time on a 2D display, bearing-time record \(\223BTR\224 displays like the one in the right hand panel of Figure 2 enjoy widespread use. A BTR is formed by integrating over all frequency bins. This results in easier target detection, and the reduced dimensionality of the process enables a display of target bearing over time. In contrast to the situation in the left panel of Figure 2, both targets are easily and clearly visible. Furthermore, this display provides time coverage absent in the FRAZ display In the following sections, we assume multiple passive arrays, each of which records aco ustic energy. The energy is processed into BTR surfaces lik e this one at each array and these are used as input for our 2D detection and tracking algorithms. Therefore, our algorithm requires only the BTR data \(and not the data from the individual array elements The BTR can be characterized statistically, in terms of expected signal given  targets by modeling the energy in the FRAZ and appeali ng to the statics that appear when summing this energy 3  S INGLE T ARGET D ETECTION AND T RACKING T HEORY  This section explains the mathematics of the Bayesian approach to detecting and tracking a single moving target Section 4 describes the numerical implementation. This methodology is expanded to the multiple target situation in Section 5 Notation The notation that will be used throughout this paper is as follows. The state of a single target at time will be denoted In this paper, our state model refers to the targets\222 2D position and velocity as    although the approach generalizes to higher order state models. Furthermore, let denote the hypothesis that no target is present at time and let denote the hypothesis that a target is present. Finally, we use the following notation to describe the measurements denotes the measurements taken by sensor at time e.g., a collection of energy arriving at different bearings taken from the BTR denotes the measurements taken by all sensors at time i.e  d denotes the collection of all measurements taken by all sensors up to and including time i.e   Fundamentally, we wish to estimate the joint probability that a target is present \(i.e is true\d its location is  given the measurements. Mathematically, the means we wish to estimate the hybrid continuous-discrete density  2 for all Notice that this quantity can be expressed as  3 i.e., as the product of the target present probability  and the target state probability   Both conceptually and implementationally, we treat the problem as separate \(but coupled\ tasks of estimating the target present probability \(\223detection\224\d the estimating target state probability \(\223tracking\224\e two portions will be covered in the following subsections Bayes Optimal Detection In the Bayesian approach, we \(i\me that an initial or prior estimate of the desired probabilities is present \(perhaps completely uninformative\and \(ii\generate a recursive formula that relates the probabilities at one time step with those at the next. This is then used at each time step to update the desired probability The target present and target absent  detection probabilities are computed recursively using the law of total probability and Bayes\222 rule, yielding      4 and    5 These equations express the current target present and 


  5 absent hypothesis probabilities in terms of the target present and target state probabilities predicted from the previous time step \(e.g  and  he conditional likelihood of the incoming measurements \(i.e  The predicted densities are formed in the standard Bayesian manner: a model on target appearance and disappearance generates predicted target present and absent probabilities  and  and  a target kinematic model predicts the target state density  We discuss these processes in more detail below The fundamental data dependent quantity needed to construct the detection update is the likelihood ratio which is a function of the sensor measurement statistics and the measured data. Notice that the normalizing constant  present in both updates need not actually be computed directly since we can determine its value using the relation   6 Bayes Optimal Tracking The target state probability is computed recursively in a manner similar to the above    7 where the constant term  does not need to be computed since the probability density integrates to 1. Again, the fundamental data dependent quantity needed to construct this update is the likelihood ratio. Also required again is the prediction density   Therefore, in principle the update for each possible  proceeds by predicting its probability forward in time according to a temporal target kinematic model updating using the likelihood ratio  Obviously, since is drawn from the continuum, some discrete representation or parameterization must be employed for computation. We defer this discussion to Section 4. The following subsections describe the temporal prediction and measurement update steps in detail Temporal update Both the detection and trac king update stages perform temporal evolution on the relevant probability distributions For the target present and absent probabilities   and  we use a simple mixing matrix approach where the probabilities at the previous time are used to predict the current probabilities, i.e            8 This corresponds to a fixed target arrival/removal probability. Our approach allows more complicated models with little impact on computational requirements Similarly, a model on target kinematics   performs the temporal update of the target state probability This relationship is expressed in discrete time as        9 This step is the most computationally challenging of the algorithm and requires a numerical approach able to efficiently compute the required probabilities. The approach we\222ve selected is discussed in more detail in the implementation section below The Multi-Sensor Likelihood ratio The fundamental data dependent quantity needed to update all densities is the likelihood ratio. In this section, we describe the computation in our model problem For convenience, we speciali ze here to two bearings-only sensors interrogating a region. The method extends to more sensors in a similar manner. We further assume each sensor makes measurements in bearing \223cells\224 \(referred to hereafter as beams\th some known distribution when the target is present  and some other distribution when the target is absent For notational brevity, we assume  and  are sensor independent, although this is also not required The measurements are energy values corresponding to discrete beams Assuming independence among the beams, the likelihood ratio can be rewritten as                  10 


  6 where the notation is used to indicate the measurement in the bearing cell corresponding to The likelihood of the two-node measurement set   conditioned on the target present hypothesis \(the numerator of the likelihood ratio\mply the product of the two target present probabilities since target presence is more likely when the data follows the target present distribution in both sensors. In contrast, the target absent hypothesis is the composite hypothesis that either \(a\th measurements are drawn from the target absent density or \(b\measurement is drawn from the target present hypothesis and one from the target absent hypothesis. Therefore, in following with the GLRT, the denominator of the likelihood ratio is computed as the maximum over the three atomic hypotheses from both sensors from sensor 1 and from sensor 2, and from sensor 1 and from sensor 2 4  S INGLE T ARGET D ETECTION AND T RACKING I MPLEMENTATION  This section describes how the mathematics of Section 3 is implemented. The approach we take here utilizes a discrete grid representation of the posterior. In contrast, other work 5 a s em p l oyed a p a rticle ap prox im atio n to th e relevan t  posteriors. As discussed earlier there are tradeoffs involved in the two approaches Representation of target state probability We represent the target state probability on a 4D discrete grid \(corresponding to the four dimensional state vector     cells. The spatial extent of this grid dictates the overall region where targets may be detected. The cell resolution must be carefully chosen based on the sensors and geometry to allow sufficient accuracy. Figure 3 gi ves an example of marginal PDFs as represented on a discrete grid The tradeoffs involved in grid resolution include the following: \(i\rithm speed is roughly linear in the number of grid cells. The number of the grid cells is the product of cells in each of the spatial and each of the velocity dimensions. This fact rewards minimizing of the number of cells either by limiting the overall region upon which the PDF is approximated or making the discretization coarse. \(ii\Single-target tr acking performance degrades as the grid cells become coarser In particular, since the sensor to target state mapping is nonlinear, performance breaks down substantially above certain cell resolution sizes depending on the sensor geometry\Both of these phenomena will be illustrated later Temporal update of the tracking probability The temporal evolution of the probability density on can be expressed in continuous time using a partial differential equation. We wish to compute    from    The relation between these two densities can be expressed as                Using \(i\econd order Taylor series approximation to     ii\ming the 223nearly constant velocity\224 model for the transition density    and \(iii\g small we find the Fokker-Planck equation  This derivation is given in more detail in the Appendix  Figure 3\226 Grid-based represent ation of the target state density. Left: Th e 4D posterior margin alized to give the probability density. Right: The marginal 


  7 In the following discussion we use this transition model Other models can be incorporated similarly, including models which use roadway constraints and higher order motion terms In the experiments we discuss later, this model is valid \(i.e the diffusivity of the target is captured statistically by the diffusivity coefficient in the model\es where robust modeling of the target dynamics is not possible, one typically appeals to a multiple model approach [13 wh i c h adds robustness to the filtering by allowing it to select from a number of candidate motion models The state probability density is represented on a discrete grid and so this differential equation must be used to update that representation. This discrete update is computed from time to time  using a backward Euler method as              13 This approach has nice stability properties in both and For more details, see [1  This is illustrated graphically in Figure 4, where the left hand side represents the posterior from the k th time step and the right hand side represents the prediction for the k+1 th  time step. The white dot represents the true target position In this example, the target is moving in the positive x  direction, causing the probability mass to evolve preferentially along the positive x direction This computation method is linear in the number of grid cells used in the discretizatio n. Linear dependence on grid cell number is achieved using the backward Euler method above, yielding a tridiagonal system of equations which is efficiently solved using Thom as\222 algorithm Fi gu r e 5  illustrates this dependency from empirical tests  Figure 5\226 Computation is linear in number of grid cells Temporal update of the target present probability The target present and absent probabilities are updated according to the simple mixing model described in eq. \(8 corresponding physically to targets arriving and leaving at a constant rate. Since this is a discrete PMF with only two possible events \(target present and target absent implemented by simply storing a single floating point number corresponding to the target present probability Measurement update of the tracking probability As discussed above, evaluating the measurement likelihood for each cell performs the target state probability update   14 This simply requires computation of the likelihood ratio at each cell Specializing again to the two-node, bearings only situation, at each time step each sensor node makes measurements at all \(discretized bearings \(beams he sensor model describes statistically the likelihood of each measurem ent conditioned on target  Figure 4\226 The temporal update of th e target state probability density 


  8 present, as illustrated in Figure 6. Note that different node locations yield different beam widths and spatial information By assumption, the joint likelihood of the measurements conditioned on target present \(the numerator\he product of the two individual likelihoods \(i.e., the noise is independent from sensor to sensor  15 where from the end of Section 3 we know   16 Here is the bearing cell \(beam\ into which projects at sensor node 1. Therefore, for each grid cell in the discrete representation of we compute the hypothesis probability as proportional to    17 As mentioned above, the hypothesis \(the denominator of the likelihood ratio\rresponds to the composite hypothesis that either \(i\neither sensor has target energy in the target bearing, or \(ii\ one of the two sensors \(but not both\has energy in the target bearing. Therefore, the probability of the hypothesis is evaluated by appealing to the GLRT as          18 Finally, the measurement update for cell is computed as           19 Measurement update of the target present probability As discussed in Section 3, the measurement update of the target present probability is performed as    20 By comparison, it is seen that the inner term in this integral is the measurement update done on the target state probability density \(eq. \(14\\erefore, the update of the target present and absent probabilities simply requires summing the \(non-normalized\et state probability after the measurement update is performed, followed by a normalization step which forces  For computational purposes, it is desirable that the target state grid contain the fewest number of cells that allow robust estimation. Cells which contain zero probability mass are useless computation and should be avoided. However since we are tracking moving ta rgets, the locations of the grid cells needed to estimate the target state density change over time. Therefore, we use a moving grid, which constantly re-centers around the estimated state of the target every update. In practice, we onl y allow the grid to translate a small number of cells at each time step, which minimizes the chance that a small number of bad measurements can shift the target off the grid  Figure 6\226 Single Sensor conditional likelihoods 


  9 On Grid Resolution As mentioned to earlier, the resolution \(spacing\of the target detection and tracking spatial grid cells is of critical importance. In our method, we choose to allow each cell center to represent the entire cell. An alternative approach would treat each cell as containing many sub-cells and requiring a weighted update. This has a similar computational burden as making the grid cell finer, and provides a benefit in the single target tracking case However, in the multitarget tracking case discussed later it introduces other problems. A discussion of these problems is deferred until later In the single target tracking case where cell centers represent the cell, the main c oncern is to ensure the cell spacing is fine enough. Th is avoids cases where the conditional likelihood has energy in large parts of a cell but does not overlap with the cell center. Figure 7 illustrates this. In this figure, cell boundaries are indicated by white lines, and cell centers by black dots. The true target location is given by the green dot. The conditional probability density is indicated by the color scale showing the intersection of the two sensor node beams. Because the grid resolution is insufficient, the cell center in the cell the target actually occupies does not corr espond to the peak of the conditional as it should. This mismatch leads to the target containing cell incorrectly r eceiving low likelihood in the measurement update  Figure 7 - Grid cells must be spaced finely enough to avoid degenerate cases where no cell center corresponds to the peak of the likelihood function The remedy for this issue is to make the cells more finely spaced. Also note that unless the grid cells are spaced grossly inadequately \(as they are in the example given Figure 11 later\is problem does typically does not persist from time step to time step as the target is moving. The most catastrophic consequence of poor grid cell resolution is track fragmentation. In the case of overly coarse cell discretization, the track existence probability will be artificially driven lower resu lting in \(incorrectly\moving the track. A new track would then be instituted very shortly On Computational Requirements The dominant properties that e ffect computations are \(i number of grid cells and \(ii\he number of targets. Section 5 discusses algorithm scaling with the number of targets. Here we focus on the single target case and note that the algorithm scales linearly with number of grid cells \(which is the product      Figure 8 illustrates empirically the tradeoff between cell resolution, tracking, and algorithm run time in the single target detection and tracking case. As the grid cell resolution decreases \(i.e., the number of cells used to represent the probability density increase\e tracking error decreases. It reaches an asymptote which is dictated by the sensor resolution. Furthermore, as the grid cell resolution decreases i.e., the number of grid cells increases\the computation time increases   Figure 8 \226 For single target tracking, performance improves as grid cells become more finely spaced. This is at the cost of increased computation time A second way to deal with th e degeneracy caused by large grid cells is to compute the cell likelihood function by weighting the likelihood of the beams into which the cell projects. In other words, inst ead of using the cell center to represent the entire cell, treat the cell as the continuum of points it represents.  Doing this exactly is computationally prohibitive, but approximate methods such as averaging discrete points in a cell are feasible. This is a net computation savings over simply making the grid cells smaller because it avoids increasing the number of cells that require temporal update In the multitarget case, the problem is more complicated Since many cells will correspond to the peak of the conditional likelihood, blindly shrinking cell size or interpolating the conditional will lead to false \(double initializations of targets. We will discuss this further in Sections 6 and 7 


  10 5  M ULTITARGET D ETECTION AND T RACKING T HEORY  In principle, multiple target detection and tracking requires estimation of the joint multitarget probability density   21 where denotes the number of targets present at time k   and  are the individual states of those targets The state space of this joint multitarget probability density grows exponentially with the number of targets and hence precise computation grows ex ponentially as well. Bruteforce multitarget discrete grid representations of this high dimensional posterior become intractable with more than two or three targets in a fo ur dimensional state space Fortunately, high fidelity modeling of the joint coupling is only necessary when targets are close together, i.e., widely spaced targets can be treated nearly optimally by solving multiple single target detection and tracking problems. In the \(unrealistic\g case, where all targets are well separated in measurement space numerical estimation of the joint density grows linearly with the number of targets rather than exponentially A more sophisticated approach to this problem is to automatically factorize the joint density into small groups of targets which must be treated jointly and develop a computational solution which is a compromise between the exponential growth of the joint computation and the linear growth of the fully factored computation. A detailed discussion of a joint density adaptive factorization approach and the precise algorithmic details in a related environment are discussed at length in [5  and  6    In our present implementation, we have chosen to simply treat the multiple target situation as a collection of single target detection and tracking problems. To account for the sub-optimality of this approach when targets are nearby in measurement space, we employ a data-censoring algorithm which operates when targets are close - i.e., we make the approximation    22 and censor some of the data fr om nearby trackers to prevent improper evaluation of the conditional likelihood Future work will extend this to high fidelity sensor modeling and joint density calculation for closely spaced targets when necessary. A sk etch of this extension analogous to the approach in [5 ws. Fi rst, th e target state and relevant uncertainty will be estimated for each target. Then those targets th at are close together will be treated in clusters. The \(now joint\ probability density for the cluster of targets will be temporally and measurement updated as a group. This computation is superlinear in the number of targets, but will only operate on targets in that cluster, rather than the entire target set. This method allows for careful physics-based modeling of the sensor returns when targets are close together e.g., including the expected coherent sums of energy from nearby targets and accurately modeling sidelobe interference\d will allow for more effective handling of crossing targets and convoy movements 6  A MBIGUOUS T ARGETS  In addition to left-right ambigu ity arising from linear arrays in the present setting there are intersection ambiguities. In the multisensor, multitarget, bearings-only environment we study here there are ambiguities arising from the \(persistent intersection of bearing measur ements across sensors from e.g., \(sensor 1, target 1\and \(sensor 2, target 2 Figure 9 gives an example of this phenomenon, by showing the multisensory conditional lik elihood surface in a highSNR and low-SNR case, respectivel y. In this example, there are two passive sensors, one lo cated at the northeast and one at the southeast of the surveillance region. There are two real targets indicated by white circles. Each passive sensor receives high energy at the b earings corresponding to the true targets as expected. This results in \(correct intersections at the true locati ons of the targets. However there are also false intersections, which correspond to the mismatched beams \(i.e., a beam from sensor 1, target 1 intersection with a beam from sensor 2, target 2 


  11 Ambiguous targets often move physically for some time and for that time are indistinguishable from real targets. This short term phenomenon is not a problem with the tracker but is a fundamental issue of physics. However, over time, the ambiguous targets can be distinguished from real targets in a tracking environment as they will move in a non-physical manner. Typically this non-physical motion takes the form of a jump movement as the ambiguities approach a line of symmetry defined by the nodes Figure 10 provides an illustration of this behavior. For the first 500 time steps \(shown at left\both the true targets green\d the ambiguous targ ets \(red\anner that is plausible physically. Ho wever, as shown at right after time step 500 the ambiguous targets move in a dramatically non-physical manner. This behavior is common and in this case is co rrelated with the ambiguity position moving through a sensor line of symmetry 7  M ULTITARGET D ETECTION   T RACKING I MPLEMENTATION  As discussed earlier, we have chosen to factorize the joint density into a collection of single target densities. This approach is optimal when targ ets are well separated but is inappropriate as targets beco me close in sensor space Future work includes an adaptive approach which will appropriately treat these closel y spaced targets jointly. In the present work however, we employ an engineering approach to cope with this sub optimality which prevents measurement sharing among cl osely spaced trackers. These algorithmic modifications mean that the final product is not simply multiple single target detection and tracking algorithms running in parallel First, we partition the surveillance region into multiple overlapping static detection grids. Each detection grid is a single target detector as described above for detecting   Figure 9 \226 Bearings intersections corresponding to true targets \(white circles nd ambiguous intersections There are two sensors, located NE and SE of the image, resp ectively. Each sensor has hi gh energy returns at the bearings corresponding to the true targ ets, yielding intersections at the true target locations. However, there are also false intersections between, for example, \(s ensor 1, target 1\ and \(sensor 2, target 2   Figure 10\226 Left: true and ambiguous trajectories for the fi rst 500 time steps of the simulation.

  12 targets in its sub-region. We compute the target present hypothesis independently for each detector grid. It is desirable that each detector gr id is small in total spatial extent to allow detection of closely spaced targets since each individual detection grid is only capable of accurately modeling the target absent/present hypothesis when there is either a single target presen t or no targets present. In contrast, it is desirable that each grid is large enough \(in total spatial extent\o capture multiple time steps of measurements on a moving target to allow accurate computation of the target present hypothesis Second, the single target detector/tracker equations discussed above\update each detector grid. The temporal and measurement updates proceed as if there were a single target present on the grid, updating the target present hypothesis with the new data. In this manner, each detector grid performs the Bayes-optimal single target detection and tracking algorithm for its spatial region If the target present hypothesis associated with a detector exceeds a threshold, the algorith m declares a new target and initializes a tracking grid to follow the target. This target grid is mobile and continually re-centered on the predicted target location. It is desirable that this tracking grid is as small as feasible for both computational reasons and also to allow multiple closely spaced targets to be tracked on their own grids. However, the grid must be large enough in spatial extent to account for temporal uncertainties in target motion and measurement error The individual target temporal updates proceed exactly as in the single target case. The measurement updates of the detection and tracking grids use a measurement-censoring step not present in the single target tracker. This measurement censoring step is executed in lieu of fully estimating the joint multitarget density, and should be looked upon as an engineering method for dealing with closely spaced targets that is less costly than fully estimating the joint density. In experiments with real data it has been found that this method often provides sufficient accuracy to perform adequate tracking. However, it is our plan to look at joint density estimation as in [5  fu ture work To elaborate, measurements that fall into the spatial extent of any tracker are censored from the detectors. Second trackers compete for measurem ents based on their prior probabilities. These steps prevent multiple targets from being incorrectly detected at the same location, and also prevent multiple nearby trackers from simply following the strongest target On Grid Resolution Like the case of single target tracking, it is important that grid cell spatial resolution be chosen judiciously. If grid cells are too coarse, it is possible no cell centers will project into the maximum of the conditional likelihood \(refer back to Figure 7\However, even if the grid size too large, the behavior of the tracker may not be catastrophic. Typical behavior is that a detector initiates a track; the tracker follows the target for some period of time and terminates the track; then the detector reinitiates a tracker on the same target. Figure 11 illustrates the effect of grid cell resolution on tracking performance. The left panel shows performance when the grid is too coarsely spaced. The red dots show track termination points, and illustrate that a single target track is routinely broken and restarted when the grid spacing is too coarse. The right panel shows performance when grid spacing is appropriately sel ected. All track s are followed throughout the entire vignette w ith no track fragmentation Unlike the case of single target tracking, the multitarget case exhibits problems when the grid resolution is too small. In particular, since the multitarget detectors constantly seek new targets, small grid cell resolution can have the unintended consequence of allowing energy from the conditional update to bleed onto both a tracker \(correctly and the underlying detector \(incorrectly\nd thus generate   Figure 11 \226 Left: Multitarget tracking with \(too\coarse grid resolution. Right: Multitarget tracking with appropriately selected resolution. In both panels, red dots show track termi nation points, green lines show true target trajectories, and the other colo red lines show the track estimates 


  13 false \(double\argets Figure 12 illustrates this situation. The conditional update correctly updates the tracker wh ich is tasked with following the target. However, the detector which is partially spatially coincident with the tracker also receives energy from the conditional update. This can lead the detector to initiate falsely\second target nearby the first target This effect can be countered a number of ways. First, we can adjust the speed at which the tracker re-centers itself The double initialization phenomenon occurs when the PDF peaks near the edge of the tracker grid. However, this method has the side effect of potentially allowing probability to fall off of the grid in low SNR environments causing track loss. Of course if the SNR is low enough or measurement outages occur tracks will be dropped. Second a guardband around the tracker that does not allow any detector sufficiently near the tracker to receive reinforcement via the conditional density can mitigate the double target problem. However, this has the side effect of preventing detection of closely spaced targets. Third increasing the spatial extent of the tracker has a similar effect as the using a guardband. It does require increased computation, but generates a better representation of the posterior There are several engineering tradeoffs. The first is that large tracker grids \(or large guard bands\ prevent falsely detecting new targets because of conditional probability spill over. However, if applied too aggressively, this will prevent correctly detecting cl osely spaced targets. Second quick tracker grid translation correctly centers the target mass, again preventing spillover into nearby detectors However, overly liberal trac ker repositioning may in fact move trackers to spurious energy locations and drop true targets off of the finite grid On Ambiguous Targets As discussed earlier, ambiguous targets will eventually move non-physically and this will cause the tracker to remove them via its natural prediction and update process Figure 13 illustrates this phenomenon. There are two real targets that create two persistent ambiguities. All four are detected and tracked automati cally. The ambiguous targets however, eventually move non-physically due to their reliance on the node bearing angles. The tracker automatically penalizes the non-physical motion and the targets\222 present hypothesis decrease quickly over time Ambiguous target removal is done automatically in the Bayesian framework as follows The PDF on target state is predicted forward in time according to the kinematic model True targets will have behavior consistent with the kinematic model \(note the kinematic model is a statistical model so it is predicting a range of possibilities for the future target state\biguous targets may behave consistently with this model for a period of time, but eventually they will appear to perform a non-physical maneuver \(these epochs typically come when the ambiguous target crosses a line of symmetry in the sensor\this point, the predicted target position will be in strong disagreement with the inco ming measurements on that target. This mismatch in predicted target position and measurements leads to a decr ease in the target present hypothesis as calculated in eq. \(4\long, only true targets remain   Figure 12 \226 Improper selection of grid resolution leads to multiple initializations on the same target. Left Measurement update of a Tracker \(red=highest likelih ood, blue=lowest\Right Measurement update of a detector which lies near the Tracker.  Since the track er size has been improperly chosen, some energy from the measurements of a single target leak s on to the detector. This can le ad to false double-initializations 


  14 8  C ONCLUSION  This paper has described a Bayesian approach to detecting and tracking multiple moving targets using acoustic data from multiple passive arrays In contrast to traditional undersea acoustic systems, which develop tracks at the single array level and require track association, our approach fuses data at the m easurement level and operates directly in the target state space We have detailed a well known nonlinear filtering approach to single target detection and tracking [1, 4 and desc ri be d our computationally efficient finite-grid approach to the required density estimation. We have furthermore extended this to the multiple target case by employing a bank of single target detector tracke rs and approximation methods that adjust for closely spaced targets. This approximate approach avoids fully treating the computationally complex joint multitarget problem Future work includes modified approaches to posterior estimation including dynamic grid extent, dynamic grid resolution, and particle filtering. It is anticipated that adaptive sampling of the posterior will lead to computational savings. Furthermore, future work includes more detailed modeling and estimation of closely spaced targets allowing a more accurate representation of the joint target density. Naively implemented, this implies exponential growth \(in the number of targets\r the probability state space being es timated. However, recent work in a related tracking domain on adaptive density factorization [5 c h a stic sa m p lin g  p article filtering    pr ovi de m e t h o d s t h at m i t i g at e t h i s com put at i o n gr owt h  when the full joint density is treated  A PPENDIX  This section discusses the details of how the single target probability density is time evolved on a discrete grid.
