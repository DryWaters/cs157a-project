Mining Generalized Fuzzy Quantitative Association Rules with Fuzzy Generalization Hierarchies Keon-Myung Lee Dept of Computer Science Chungbuk National University and Advanced Information Technology Research CentertAITrc Cheongju Chungbuk KOREA kmlee@cbucc.chungbuk.ac.kr Abstract\222 Association rule mining is an exploratory learning task to discover some hidden dependency relationships among items in transaction data Quantitative association rules denote association rules with both categorical and quantitative attributes. There have been several works on quantitative association rule 
mining such as the application of fuzzy techniques to quantitative association rule mining the generalized association rule mining for quantitative association rules and importance weight incorporation into association rule mining for taking into account the user\222s interest This paper introduces a new method for generalized fuzzy quantitative association rule mining with importance weights The method uses fuzzy concept hierarchies for categorical attributes and generalization hierarchies of fuzzy linguistic terms for quantitative attributes. It enables the users to flexibly 
perform the association rule mining by controlling the generalization levels for attributes and the importance weights for attributes Keywords association rule fuzty association rule generalized association rule quantitative association rule, importance weight 1 Introduction Data mining also known as knowledge discovery in databases, is a study to find hidden, potentially useful information from databases. Inducing association rules is one of the important research issues in data mining An association rule expressed 
as X  Y indicates a pattern in transaction databases where the transactions containing the items X also contain the items Y An 221 This work was supported by the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation\(K0SEF through AITrc example of an association rule is 22120 of transactions that contain bread also contain orange 1 of transactions contain both 
items\224 Here 20 is called confidence and 1 is called support The problem of mining association rules was first introduced by Agrawal et al.[l for databases consisting of only categorical attributes In categorical association rules X  Y both antecedent X and consequent Y indicates the appearance of corresponding items To handle databases with both categorical and quantitative attributes i.e numeric, interval values a quantitative association rule 
mining method was proposed by Srikant et al.[21 The method finds association rules by partitioning the quantitative attribute domain combining adjacent partitions and then transforming the problem into binary one i.e categorical association rule mining problem In quantitative association rule mining records of a database table are considered as transactions where a pair of an attribute and its corresponding value plays the role of an item in categorical association rule mining Therefore, quantitative association rules 
come to have the pairs of an attribute and its value like Age 20..30 and Sex Female  Number of friends 2.3 As an approach to take into account the relative importance of attributes, the concept of weighted items was incorporated in the association rule The item weighting enables users to control the mining results by assigning larger weights to attribute in which they are more interested rather than others There have been some 
studies to integrate fuzzy techniques into association rule mining 3,4,5,7.91 Instead of using crisp intervals in quantitative association rule mining some methods have been proposed to make use of fuzzy intervals defined by membership They label the fuzzy intervals with fuzzy linguistic tem such as young high and so on It makes it possible to produce more 0-7803-7078-3/0v$10.00 C IEEJL Page 2977 


descriptive association rules Some methods have been proposed to exploit fuzzy techniques for quantitative attribute domain partitioning and attribute weighting for reflecting importance of attribute[7,9 Sometimes it is more meaningful to have association rules with generalized items rather than base items appearing in transactions. There have been some works to produce generalized association ruIes[lO In this study we are interested in mining generalized fuzzy quantitative association rule with weighted items We propose a mining method to use fuzzy concept hierarchies and generalization hierarchies of fuzzy linguistic terms for categorical attribute generalization and quantitative attribute domain partitioning to allow users to weigh the importance of attributes This paper is organized as follows Section 2 describes fuzzy concept hierarchies for categorical attributes and generalization hierarchies of fuzzy linguistic terms for quantitative attributes which are used in generalizing attribute values Section 3 introduces some notations and measures that are used in the proposed association rule mining method Section 4 presents the proposed generalized fuzzy quantitative association rule mining method. Section 5 gives an example to apply the proposed method and then Section 6 draws conclusions 2 Fuzzy Concept Hierarchies and Generalization Hierarchies of Fuzzy Linguistic Terms Concept hierarchies are commonly used to define generalization relationships among domain concepts Conventional concept hierarchies represent only crisp generalization relationships between concepts A concept hierarchy is represented by an acyclic digraph N A where Nand A are a set of concept nodes and a set of edges n n to represent the generalization relationships, respectively An edge n n indicates that n is a generalized concept of n In conventional concept hierarchies, all edges describing generalization relationship are crisp On the other hand fuzzy concept hierarchies contain fuzzy edges n n yw where y is the generalization degree of n to n A fuzzy edge n n y indicates that n is a partially generalized concept of n with the degree ym In fuzzy concept hierarchies a concept may have partial generalization relationships with several generalized concepts. Since fuzzy concept hierarchies are flexible to represent generalization relationship between concepts fuzzy concept hierarchies are used to generalize categorical attributes in our new fuzzy association rule mining method Figure 1 shows a fuzzy concept hierarchy for a categorical attribute software where numbers labeled on edges indicates the generalization degree between corresponding concepts. For example emcs belongs to program editor with the degree 1 and it belongs to word processor with the degree 0.3 anv emaci vi WO rd Excel Figure 1 Fuzzy concept hierarchy for programs For quantitative attributes we can make fuzzy partitions with various granularities It means that we can partition an attribute domain into various numbers of fuzzy intervals for instance, with 10 fuzzy intervals 5 fuzzy intervals or 2 fuzzy intervals As the smaller number of fuzzy intervals there are the more general the fuzzy intervals are That is to say a fuzzy linguistic term set defined by 5 fuzzy intervals is more general than that by 10 fuzzy intervals A generalization hierarchy of fuzzy linguistic terms on a quantitative attribute is a hierarchy structure in which upper level nodes represent more general fuzzy linguistic terms i.e more larger fuzzy intervals than lower level nodes do. The fuzzy linguistic terms are organized into a hierarchy according to their coverage over the domain For two fuzzy linguistic terms A and B we say that A is more general concept than B when the membership function x of A contains that p of B that is Vx x 1 pu\(x The membership functions for fuzzy intervals making fuzzy partitions can be determined in various ways One is by expert opinion or by people\222s perception Another way is by statistical methods Fuzzy clustering based on self-organized learning also is used to generate membership functions Here we assume that the membership functions for fuzzy partitions with various granularities have been already determined by some way and the trapezoidal fuzzy 0-7803-7U78-3/0l/$lO.W C IEEE Page 2978

single bond  aromatic bond single bOnd  aromatic bDnd d CBO Figure 9 Two fragments extracted from a sei of steroids On the left, single and aromatic bonds were treated as different bond types. on the right they were treated as the same bond type 3.4 Treatment of Aromatic Bonds An important aspect of molecular fragment mining is the treatment of aromatic rings Since ammaticity is not clearly defined and can be modeled differently i.e explicit aro matic bonds vs alternating single and double bonds it is desirable to be able to take it into account throughout the mining process itself We achieve this by modeling aro matic bonds as either single or double bonds with a flag that indicates aromaticity This allows us to choose to ignore this flag during mining and hence to find fragments that contain either aromatic or single resp double bonds The following example illustrates why this is desirable Using a small set of steroid compounds we derived frag ments that occur in ail of them support=100%\using the standard algorithm Figure 9 left shows the correspond ing fragment Note how only two rings with an incomplete third ring are discovered of the four ring structure that is typical for steroids However if we model aromatic bonds as single+flag and allow the algorithm to ignore this flag the resulting fragment contains all four rings see Figure 9 right For some steroids this fourth ring consists of sin gle bonds while others have an aromatic ring at this posi tion However most chemists still regard this as the same 4 ring structure Such selective 223tolerance\224 against some mis matches can therefore make the presented algorithm more useful for real applications 4 Conclusions We presented an algorithm to find relevant molecular frag ments in large chemical structure databases The algorithm allows us to focus on fragments that help to discriminate be tween different classes of molecules The underlying search method, which is based on a depth first search with struc tural pruning makes it possible to find such fragments effi ciently without the need for frequent reembeddings of frag ment candidates, which is a known problem of previously reponed approaches We have shown how the proposed method finds relevant fragments using data from a well known HIV-screening compound database The extracted fragments successfully model several of the activity classes known for this dataset Future work will focus on making the presented approach more meaningful for the underlying application In partic ular finding fragments that match exactly is not of prime interest to chemists As demonstrate above some types of ring structures are considered functionally equivalent which should be taken into account by the search algorithm as well We are currently exploring ways to include such 223fuzziness\224 into the underlying search algorithm directly References I R Agrawal T Imielienski and A Swami.

The execution time of the HPA program pass 2 is shown in figure 13 as the number of PCs is changed The maximum number of PCs used in this evaluation is 100 Reasonably good speedup is achieved in this application as the number of PCs is increased 5 Conclusion In this paper we presented performance evaluation of parallel database processing on an ATM connected 100 node PC cluster system The latest PCs enabled us to obtain over 110Mbps throughput in point-to-point communication on a 155Mbps ATM network even with the so-called 217\217heavy\220\220 TCP/IP This greatly helped in developing the system in a short period since we were absorbed in fixing many other problems Massively parallel computers now tend to be used in business applications as well as the conventional scientific computation Two major business applications decision support query processing and data mining were picked up and executed on the PC cluster The query processing environment was built using the results of our previous research the super database computer SDC project Performace evaluation results with a query of the standard TPC-D benchmark showed that our system achieved superior performance especially when transposed file organization was employed As for data mining we developed a parallel algorithm for mining association rules and implemented it on the PC cluster By utilizing aggregate memory of the system efficiently the system showed good speedup characteristics as the number of nodes increased The good price/performance ratio makes PC clusters very attractive and promising for parallel database processing applications All these facts support the effectiveness of the commodity PC based massively parallel database servers Acknowledgment This project is supported by NEDO New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization in Japan Hitachi Ltd technically helped us extensively for ATM related issues References  R Agrawal T Imielinski and A Swami Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases In Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data  pages 207--216 1993  R Agrawal and R Srikant Fast algorithms for mining association rules In Proceedings of International Conference on Very Large Data Bases  1994  A C Arpaci-Dusseau R H Arpaci-Dusseau D E Culler J M Hellerstein and D A Patterson High-performance sorting on Networks of Workstations In Proceedings of International Conference on Management of Data  pages 243--254 1997  D.S Batory On searching transposed files ACM TODS  4\(4 1979  P.A Boncz W Quak and M.L Kersten Monet and its geographical extensions A novel approach to high performance GIS processing In Proceedings of International Conference on Extending Database Technology  pages 147--166 1996 15 Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE SC97 Conference \(SC\22297 0-89791-985-8/97 $ 17.00 \251 1997 IEEE

US Coast Guard approved personal floatation devices must be supplied and inspected where employees are engaged in work where there is danger of drowning Required employee protection in public work areas to include the following  Warning signs or flags and other traffic control devices  Barricades for additional protection to employees  Barricades around excavated areas  Warning lights at night prominently displayed Lines or equipment which may be sub to backfeed from cogeneration or other sources are to be worked as energized in accordance with the applicable paragraphs of the Rules Comments w APPA submits the following comments regarding this Special Conditions section Recommends that the wording regarding capacitors be modified to include a waiting period for five minutes prior to short circuiting and grounding in accordance with industry standards for discharging of capacitors For series street light circuits, recommends that language be added for bridging to either install a bypass conductor or by placement of grounds so that work occurs between the grounds Recommends modification of the section regarding personal floatation devices to not apply to work sites near fountains decorative ponds swimming pools or other bodies of water on residential and commercial property Definitions x This section of the proposed Rules includes definitions of terms Definitions particularly pertinent to understanding the proposal and which have not previously been included are listed as follows Authorized Employee  an employee to whom the authority and responsibility to perform a specific assignment has been given by the employer who can demonstrate by experience or training the ability to recognize potentially hazardous energy and its potential impact on the work place conditions and who has the knowledge to implement adequate methods and means for the control and isolation of such energy CZearance for Work  Authorization to perform specified work or permission to enter a restricted area Clearance from Hazard  Separation from energized lines or equipment Comments x The following summarizes the changes in some of the definitions which APPA recommends Add to the definition for authorized employee It the authorized employee may be an employee assigned to perform the work or assigned to provide the energy control and isolation function  Recommends that OSHA modify the definition for a line clearance tree trimmer to add the word qualified resulting in the complete designation as a qualified line clearance tree trimmer Recommends that OSHA modify the definition of qualified employee" to remove the word construction from the definition since it is felt that knowledge of construction procedures is beyond the scope of the proposed rule resulting in APPA's new A2-18 I 


wording as follows more knowledgeable in operation and hazards associated with electric power generation transmission and/or distribution equipment Recommends that OSHA add a definition for the word practicable and replace the word feasible with practicable wherever it appears in the proposed regulations and that practicable be further defined as capable of being accomplished by reasonably available and economic means OTHER ISSUES Clothing OSHA requested comments on the advisability of adopting requirements regarding the clothing worn by electric utility industry employees EEI has presented comments which indicates research is underway prior to establishing a standard for clothing to be worn by electric utility employees However EEI's position is that this standard has not developed to the extent that it could be included in the OSHA Rules Both APPA and EEI state that they would support a requirement that employers train employees regarding the proper type of clothing to wear to minimize hazards when working in the vicinity of exposed energized facilities Grandfathering Due to the anticipated cost impact on the utility industry of the proposed Rules requiring that existing installations be brought to the requirements of the proposed Rules both APPA and EEI propose that the final Rules include an omnibus grandfather provision This provision would exempt those selected types of facilities from modification to meet the new rules EEI states that if the grandfathering concept is incorporated that electric utility employees will not be deprived of proper protection They propose that employers be required to provide employees with a level of protection equivalent to that which the standard would require in those instances in which the utility does not choose to modify existing facilities to comply with the final standard Rubber Sleeves OSHA requests comments from the industry on whether it would be advisable to require rubber insulating sleeves when gloves are used on lines or equipment energized at more than a given voltage EEI states its position that utilities should continue to have the option of choosing rubber gloves or gloves and sleeves to protect employees when it is necessary to work closer to energized lines than the distances specified in the clearance tables Preemuting State Laws EEI requests that the final Rules be clear in their preempting state rules applicable to the operation and maintenance work rules for electric power systems. This is especially critical since some states now have existing laws which are more stringent than the proposed OSHA Rules Examples are 1 in California and Pennsylvania where electric utility linemen are prohibited from using rubber gloves to work on lines and equipment energized at more than certain voltages and 2 in California and Connecticut where the live line bare hand method of working on high voltage transmission systems is prohibited One utility Pacific Gas  Electric has obtained a variance from the California OSHA to perform live line bare-hand transmission maintenance work on an experimental basis Coiiflicts Between the Rilles and Part 1926 Subpart V Since many of the work procedures in construction work and operation and maintenance work are similar and difficult to distinguish between EEI requests that the final order be clear in establishing which rule has jurisdiction over such similar work areas A2-19 v 


IMPACTS ON COSTS AND ASSOCIATED BENEFITS In its introduction to the proposed rules OSHA has provided an estimate of the annual cost impact on the electric utility industry for the proposed des of approximately 20.7 million OSHA estimates that compliance with this proposed standard would annually prevent between 24 and 28 fatalities and 2,175 injuries per year The utilities which have responded to this proposed standard through their respective associations have questioned the claims both of the magnitude of the cost involved and the benefit to the industry in preventing fatalities and lost-time injuries Both EEI and APPA feel that the annual cost which OSHA estimates are significantly lower than would be realized in practice Factors which APPA and EEI feel were not properly addressed include the following OSHA has not accurately accounted for cost of potential retroactive impacts including retrofitting and modifying existing installations and equipment OSHA has not consistently implemented performance based provisions in proposed rules  many portions require specific approaches which would require utilities to replace procedures already in place with new procedures Estimates were based on an average size investor-owned utility of 2,800 employees and an average rural cooperative of 56 employees, which are not applicable to many smaller systems such as municipal systems OSHA has not adequately addressed the retraining which would be necessary with modifying long-established industry practices to be in accordance with the OSHA rules EEI claims that OSHA's proposed clearance requirements would not allow the use of established maintenance techniques for maintaining high voltage transmission systems and thus would require new techniques For an example of the cost which is estimated to be experienced as a result of the new Rules one of the EEI member companies has estimated that approximately 20,000 transmission towers would need to be modified to accommodate the required step bolts in the Rules at an estimated cost of 6,200,000 Additionally this same company estimates that the annual cost of retesting live line tools for its estimated 1,000 tools would be 265,000 Additionally, both EEI and APPA question the additional benefits which OSHA claims would result from implementation of the new Rules APPA questions the estimates of preventing an additional 24 to 28 fatalities annually and 2,175 injuries per year in that it fails to account for the fact that the industry has already implemented in large part safety measures which are incorporated in the Rules EEI and APPA also point out that many preventable injuries cannot be eliminated despite work rules enforcement and safety awareness campaigns since many such accidents which result in fatalities are due to employee being trained but not following the employer's training and policies PRESENT STATUS OF RULES According to information received from the OSHA office in February 1993 the final Rules are to be published no later than July 1993 and possibly as soon as March 1993 OSHA closed their receipt of comments in March 1991 and no further changes in the rules are thought possible A2-20 


CONCLUSION The OSHA 1910.269 which proposes to cover electric utility operation and maintenance work rules affects a multitude of working procedures as are summarized in this paper It is not possible at the present time to assess the final structure of the Rules as may be proposed in 1993 or subsequent years Since the comments from the utility associations APPA and EEI were made following the initial release of the proposed OSHA Rules in 1989 a significant amount of time has elapsed where other events have occurred which may affect the form of the final Rules The 1993 NESC went into effect in August 1992 and includes some of the requirements to which the commenters objected For example a significant requirement in the Part 4 of the 1993 NESC requires that rubber gloves be utilized on exposed energized parts of facilities operating at 50 to 300 volts This requirement is in conflict with EEl\222s proposed change to the OSHA Rules which would still allow working such secondary facilities without the use of rubber gloves Electric utilities are advised to review the January 31 1989 proposed operation and maintenance Rules as summarized in this paper and to review their procedures which would be affected by application of the Rules Many of the procedures proposed in the Rules provide valuable guidance in electric utilities\222 operation and maintenance activities Where the cost impact is not significant, it is recommended that utilities consider implementing such procedures in expectation of the Rules being published in the next few months Also it would be appropriate for electric utilities to review the 1993 edition of the NESC since there are portions of the Rules which have resulted in changes in the NESC These changes mainly occur in Part 4 Rules for the Operation of Electric Supply and Communications Lines and Equipment The concerns which the commenters have addressed regarding the cost impact and the resulting benefits experienced as a result of the promulgation of the Rules are real ones and must be addressed in the final Rules As a result this paper cannot present a conclusion regarding the full impact of the Rules The development of such Rules continue to be an ongoing matter and will undoubtedly require later analysis when the final rules are published A2-21
