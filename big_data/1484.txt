While much work has been\nfocused on the sensors, communication and network aspects of\nIoT systems, this paper investigates into service provisioning in\nIoT environment. In particular the paper focuses on message\nscheduling in an IoT environment where things or sensors are\nclustered into groups with each group has a message broker that\ndelivers the messages originated from the group to the ultimate\nreceiver of the sensed data. The message scheduler operates\non the brokers to decide which message to be transmitted\nfirst. While most message scheduling algorithms consider only\napplication-layer features of messages \(such as expiry time systems efficiency. Furthermore, via routing, energy\nefficiency has also become a salient feature of the proposed\nscheduling algorithm. The simulation results have shown the ef-\nfectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed message scheduling\nalgorithm both in terms of service response time and energy\nconsumption.\nkeywords Internet of Things \(IoT SOA efficiency.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nInternet of things \(IoT using RFID \(Radio Frequency Identification Wireless sensor Networks any communication protocol [1]. Smart intelligent\nobjects would take place of humans and machines in the every\nfield of life like intelligent transportation, climate monitoring,\nhealth care, supply chain etc According to forecast of the\nauthority of the U.S. advisory body \(FORRESTER between object to object and human to\nhuman will reach 30:1 in the field of IoT in 2020 [2].\nWith the concept of SOA \(service-oriented Architecture service, where it should be called a distinct and complete\nservice. These heterogeneous objects communicate with each\nother by calling or invoking other services [3]. For IoT they\nare directly related to real world and directly sensing the\ninformation from environment. For the idea of the IoT based\non provisioning of these services, SOA approach seems to be a\nright solution. In order to keep basic interactions between these\nSOA services reliable, a number of new protocols, networking\ntechnologies and device capabilities have emerged.\nThey enable these enormous physical world objects to have\nthe communication and computation capabilities to interact\nwith their surrounding environment [4].\nOne of the IoT challenge to achieve is to manage and\nintegrate heterogeneous devices with dealing the scalability\nvery well. Two-tier architecture, with limited capabilities in\nterm of scalabilty and loose coupling is not a suitable choice.\nIn this paper we are considering an IoT brokered system\narchitecture. In our proposed systems, IoT things/objects are\nclustered into groups called IoT subgroups.\nEach IoT subgroup has its own broker acting as a buffer\nand exchange centre for the request and forwarding responses\nfor each its subgroup members \(sensor devices messages of its subgroup and send to the sink/ultimate\nreceiver of sensed data on their behalf. We consider this\narchitecture from the point of view of scheduling messages\nfrom these sensors while conserving their battery life as well.\nThere is no considerable work have been seen dealing on\noptimized scheduling and routing with the energy efficiency\nproblem with respect to IoT. However as WSN is the enabling\ntechnology for IoT and is a similar field as well. So we\nconsider the related work from the WSNs aspect.\nIn Y. Wen et al. discuss energy reduction solution for\nheterogeneous devices in the context of duty scheduling \(Mac-\nLayer adjustment of transmission ranges \(Physical\nLayer routing \(Application Layer effective\nbalancing in cluster size with dynamic transmission range [5].\nR.Rathna et al. proposed an algorithm to conserve en-\nergy using TDMA \(Time Division Multiple Access number of times;\na node has to wake up, during a time slot, to be in active\nmode [6].\nWhile M.Saleh et al discussed the real time scheduling\nalgorithm with optimization of security service according to\nnetwork dynamics.

This is where our work in this\npaper comes into play. Our work aims to provide a message\nscheduling algorithm that 


is not only energy-aware but also\ninteracting with network-layer routing algorithms.\nFor broker managing the precise order of messages and then\ntransferring of the data to the sink node is very important.\nScheduling of these messages is important area of research as\nstability in the responses should be guaranteed when there is\na large scale of heterogeneous varying-sized messages coming\nfrom sensor nodes. If the waiting times for the responses are\nfollowing no pattern/order then it could severely affects the\nbattery life of these nodes.\nHence to maintain a stable service quality we consider the\nrequest periods of different sensor messages, check the traffic\nintensity based on the queuing theory and finally we rearrange\nthe message requesting order by the proposed scheduling\nalgorithm by adjusting the polling frequencies for messages.\nThe improvement of message stability in tern of response\ntime resulting in energy efficiency and prolonged lifetime of\nthe network can be shown in the evaluation results of the\nimplemented system.\nWe discuss proposed IoT Messaging Service Architecture\nand Problem Statement in Section II. Section III describes the\nproposed energy aware-message scheduling algorithm. Section\nIV presents performance evaluation and discussion related to\nsimulation results. In Section V a summary of contribution is\ngiven with ideas of future enhancement.\nII PROPOSED IOT MESSAGING SERVICE ARCHITECTURE\nAND PROBLEM STATEMENT\nA. Proposed IoT Message System Architecture\nOur IoT system architecture is based on a brokered architec-\nture, as depicted in Figure 1.With more and more direct links\nto broker, the idea is to overcome the limitation of direct links,\nthe whole system can be divided into small subsystems called\nIoT subgroups. It is following a clustering approach. Here one\nset of sensor nodes called IoT subgroup, where every node can\nbecome the broker each time. Every time the node which is\nthe broker takes the responsibility of aggregating the data from\nits nearby nodes and sends the data to the base station, there\nby reduces the energy wastage of all the nodes.\nIn networking, routing refers to choosing an appropriate\npath over which data is transmitted through. The routing tech-\nnique adopted in this paper is derived from the LEACH\(Low\nEnergy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy  heterogeneous messages are sent by\nthe sensor nodes to the exchange centre i.e. broker. Each\nmessage is of different size having different parameters like\nmessage expiry time,request tim period etc. As the sensor\nnodes are energy constrained nodes, the idea is to retain their\nenergy level for longer period of time Data processing and\nFig. 1. Proposed IoT Messaging System and Network Architecture\ndata transfer require more power. Poor transmission efficiency\ncan make service quality of displaying heterogeneous mes-\nsages low as well as affects the battery life of these nodes.\nThe instability in the responses affects the lifetime of nodes\nand ultimately the entire network.\nFocus is to design a system for IoT environment that maxi-\nmizes the lifetime of the whole sensor network by reducing the\namount of power used by sensors and reducing the response\ntime by scheduling the messages sent by them.\nWe are considering the system from two complementing\naspects: network layer routing and application-layer message\nscheduling. While most researches focus on only one aspect.\nThe aim of this work is to investigate both aspects in unified\nsystem architecture This design of this architecture takes\ninto consideration both routing algorithm and the message\nscheduling algorithm.\nB. Problem Statement\nWe want to investigate service provisioning in IoT envi-\nronment. We are considering a unified architecture of network\nlevel routing and application level message scheduling. Our ul-\ntimate aim is to improve IoT system efficiency by reducing the\noverall energy consumption and improving service response\ntime.\nMost of the work in energy aware system for WSNs has\nnot considered this aspect of service provisioning and affect of\nresponse time on the battery life time of nodes. We use energy\n312\nconsumption model based on first order radio model and clus-\ntered WSNs approach following LEACH While scheduling\nalgorithm is based on SPT \(Shortest Processing Time ENERGY-AWARE MESSAGE SCHEDULING\nALGORITHM\nA. Energy Consumption Model\nConsider a network with N nodes randomly distributed\nand clustered in to IoT subgroup. Sensor nodes are sending\nmessages to the designated broker within its subgroup. All\nnodes have the same sensing, processing and transmitting\nability, and they have the same initial energy. We are using\nFirst order radio energy consumption model as in [11]. We\nassume that the base station \(sink be transmitted to the sink/base station, data fusion is\nincorporated into the routing protocol that makes it scalable;\nin term of number of messages sent; and robust for dynamic\nnetworks.\nIt has been proved that LEACH achieved as much as a\nfactor of 8 reductions in energy dissipation compared with\nconventional routing protocols [11] . Broker receives and\ncompress the messages then it amplify the signal to send the\nmessages safely to the destination/sink. We assumed the values\nfor the parameters Eelec and Eamp that remains consistent\nthroughout the experimentation.\nEelec: Energy dissipated to run the transmitter or receiver\ncircuitry.\nEamp: Energy dissipated in transmission amplifier in order\nto amplify the signal enough to reach the destination.\nThus, the system spends:\n• To transmit a message r\nETr = Eelec ? k + Eamp ? k ? d2 


1 2 points in eq \(1 2 Analysis using M/M/1 Queuing Model\nWe used M/M/1 queue to model the arrival and service rate\nof all messages coming from sensor nodes in IoT subgroups.\nEvery IoT subgroup has its own broker which is working on\nbehalf of all the IoT sensors or devices attached to it. The\nscheduler is running at the broker level. The arrival rate and\nservice rate for rth message for r={1, 2, . . . , n} are represented\nby ?r and µrrespectively. We can get the traffic intensity of\nthese messages as given in eq 4 and 5.\nIn this system every message from the sensor has a service\nrequest period time and successful transmission time. The\nservice time is the successful transmission time by the broker\nwhile the request period time defines the rate at which the\nmessage is arriving in the broker queue. We check the traffic\nintensity of the system which should always be less than 1.\nAfter evaluating the system traffic, if the value of this ?r\nis greater than1 then the periods of the messages must be\nscheduled and assigned again to have the system traffic less\nthan 1.\nC. Message Scheduling Algorithm\nWe first analyze the periods of different sensor messages\ncoming from sensor devices. Based on the queue theory, we\nuse a M/M/1 queue to check the traffic intensity and adjust\nthe polling frequencies for messages, and finally we rearrange\nthe message requesting order by the proposed scheduling\nalgorithm based on SPT rule. The improvement of message\nstability can be shown in the evaluation results of the imple-\nmented system.\nSeveral messages coming from devices classified as n\ntypes. Next, for rth type message r={1, 2 n} successful\ntransmission time of the request is denoted as Ttransr , and\nrequest time period is denoted as Rtimer . Each message\ncan be represented as Messr\(Rtimer ,Ttransr service rate of the rth message are\nrepresented as ?r= 1Rtimer and µr=\n1\nTtransr\n, respectively. Then\nwe check the traffic intensity of the overall system ? by adding\ntraffic intesity of each of rth message ?r in all IoT subgroups.\n?r =\n?r\nµr\n\(3 4 5 request time period\nfor message should be altered and assigned again to keep the\nsystem in steady state. It means that the request period should\nbe longer enough to get the re-calculated system traffic ? < 1.\nWe can say that it is a tradeoff between the stability and the\nquality of the service in an unstable network.\nMost of the messages coming from the sensor objects\nare carrying information regarding environment , such as\ntemperature and humidity, changes gradually in a small degree,\nso the idea is to ignore some of the non-critical data, that\nmay be not resulting a serious consequences. Proper ignoring\ncan reduce the chances of long waiting queues and messages\nand results in improvement of the overall performance of the\nmessage transmission.\nIn the proposed algorithm, each request time period length\nwill be calculated with a check on the overall system traffic\nintensity. Initially, all messages have the same request rate and\nit represents the desired request rate by the user at the start.\nRminr= Initial request time period for all the rth type of\nmessages When the network was unstable in term of response\ntime, and the system follows no scheduling scheme. The\n313\nactual value of the request period is updated by a trade-off\nmechanism. As traffic intensity has a serious impact on the\noverall performance of system so it is considered first in our\nsystem.\nHowever this time of request period will progressively\nincrease by the ratio of minimum request period Rminr The\ntraffic intensity of the whole system will be recalculated by the\nnew value of request period, and the messages are rearranged\nby the new value of traffic intensity; then, the check on the\noverall traffic intensity will be made again and so on. Until\nthe loop ends, finally system traffic intensity will be less than\n1 making the system stable.\nThe given algorithm aims to reduce the message delivery\ntime \(thus leading to reduced service response time client side. It rearranges the message requesting\norder so that responses are guaranteed and stably displayed in\nthe unstable and power limited network.\nThe next section describes how this messages rearrangement\naffects the life time of IoT sensors network under routing\nprotocols. When a sensor or device sends a message to the\nAlgorithm 1 Proposed Message scheduling Algorithm in Each\nIoT Subgroup\n1: for rth periodic message:Messr\(Rtimer ,Ttransr for all Rtimer=Rminr ,\n5: ?r=\nTtransr\nRtimer\n, for r={1, 2, . . . , n}\n6: while ?>1 do\n7: sort Messr in a Rtimer descendent order.\nfor all r={1, 2, . . . , n}\n8: Rtimer=Rtimer+\nRminr\n2r\n9 n?n\nr=1\nTtransr\nRtimer\n10: end while\n11: Request Messr in a descendant µr= 1Ttransr order.\n12: end for\n13 end for\nbroker, it dissipates some energy in this transfer of message.\nThen it has to wait for the response from the broker. This\nwaiting time affects the battery life of the sensor or device. If\nthe response time of the system is large and a sensor has to\nwait for long time it spends the battery with every tick of the\nclock But if this response time is shortened by arrangement\nof message periods, it would reduce the waiting time 


and\nultimately power of the sensors. So in our proposed system we\nhave considered energy aware scheduling algorithm to reduce\nthis response time and ultimately saving the energy of the\nsystem.\nAs the underlying routing algorithm in IoT subgroup in-\nspired from clustering-based routing protocol [11] ,where bro-\nkers in each IoT subgroup is selected randomly that results in\ndistribution of the energy load evenly in the network doubling\nthe useful system lifetime for the networks.\nFig. 2. Response time of 100 messages with and without schedualing\nThe model of the proposed system considers the response\ntime that reduces the total dissipated energy with respect\nto waiting time of the nodes following considered routing\nalgorithm. Scheduling results in making a power saver system\nthat consumes less energy with more alive sensors nodes and\nincreasing the overall lifetime of the network.\nIV. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION AND DISCUSSION\nA. Simulation Setup\nFor our experiment we use Matlab version 7.8. For the\nmessaging system in the IoT subgroup we use M/M/1 queue.\nFor every rth periodic message:Messr request period time and\ntransmission time are represented by variables Rtimer Ttransr\nrespectively. While using energy consumption model , trans-\nmitting energy dissipation by nodes ETr is computed as in\neq \(1 2 same energy at the beginning\nand then with simulation their energies are deducted as per\ntheir roles \(Broker or simple node the proposed system stabilise the service response\ntime of the messages and in result makes its energy efficient.\nWe evaluate energy-efficient messaging scheduling algorithm\nfor IoT environment, with the system when no schedulling is\napplied on the same.\nB. IoT Service Response Time\nWe compare the proposed message scheduler with the\nsituation where there is no scheduler used. Figure 2 shows\nthe response time of both cases against first 100 messages,\nwith and without scheduling. Result proves that proposed\nscheduling algorithm can effectively stabilize the requests\nwithin IoT subgroups. The request period times are considered\nand the messages having smaller request processing time are\ndealt first. With the applied SPT rule the message response is\nstably being displayed in the graph. It makes the response time\nvariation between 0 .3 to 0 .6 unit of time i.e. microseconds.\nWhile with the unscheduled approach the response is varying\nfrom 0.1 to 3.5 unit of time.\nThis scheme has improved the stability of responses but\nthere is a trade-off between the stability of messages and\nquality of the service.\n314\nFig. 3. Graph showing total dissipated energy while applying different\npercentages of Broker\nC. Energy Efficiency\nAs we consider clustering approach in which brokers are\nrandomly selected in each iteration of simulation. However\npercentage of brokers among the whole number of sensor\nnodes in a network substantially impacts the amount of energy\ndissipated and the accuracy of data delivered. For example, if\nthis percentage is very small, data compression would lead\non to large loss in the energy for accuracy of data delivered\nwhich are essential to describe a phenomenon obviously. In\naddition some nodes suffer from being far away from broker,\nso they have to send their data very far to reach broker On\nthe other hand, large percentage would result in large depleted\nenergy which is necessary to transmit many global messages\nto base station. Therefore, there is a trade-off between energy\nefficiency and data accuracy.\nSystem is analyzed from the point of view of proposed\nscheduling. The above figure 3 explains the scenario where\nwe experimented different percentages of brokers and analyzed\nthe effect on the total system energy dissipation. While per-\ncentage of broker is at lowest side i.e. 1% , for the scheduling\nit tends to be higher as broker is 1 and all rest of the nodes\nare sending messages to this and waiting for the response as\nwell. This response time results in reduction of their energy\nstate; secondly this broker has lot of messages to compress\nand sent to far away base station. While without scheduling\nit shows the direct relationship between energy dissipated and\npercentage of brokers. Overall energy consumption increases\nwith the increase of percentages. Responses are not guaranteed\nand waiting time is varied. While with scheduling total energy\ndepletion is decreased at 5% and then almost stabilized with\nincreasing order of percentages. The reason is as the response\ntime is stable resulting in efficient energy saver system.\nFigure 3 demonstrate apparently the huge difference in energy\nconsumption between scheduling and no-scheduling system.\nWith scheduled messages node uses its energy in a very clever\nand efficient way.\nThe effect of applying different percentages of broker are\nalso checked against number of alive nodes as shown in\nfigure:4. For every percentage of brokers we have run the\nsimulation for 5 number of rounds. The graph shows the\ndifference between power saver system and system when no\nscheduling is applied. Blue bars in figure:4 show the no of\nFig 4. Graph showing number of alive nodes against different percentages\nof Broker\nFig. 5. Graph showing residual energies of two systems in 10 rounds of\nsimulation\nalive nodes when energy efficient scheduling algorithm was\nrunning and red bars show no of alive nodes when there is no\nschedualing. It proves that with respect to network lifetime,\npower saver system carries out very good performance in\nsaving energy and extending the network lifetime.\nIt provides useful battery lifetime for sensor nodes in\ncontrast with other system being 


considered. Our experimented\nresults are also evaluated from another aspect where both\nsystems are evaluated for 10 number of rounds of simulation\nand their residual energy is compared. Message scheduled\nsystem saves more energy as shown in the graph \(Figure:5 unit of energy residual\nenergy in the first round and have energy level of almost 100\nJ till 10th round of simulation. While blue line indicates the\nresidual energy of unscheduled system, it starts with 500 J and\ntends towards 0 for last checked round.\nV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\nThis paper has proposed an energy-efficient messaging\nscheduling algorithm for IoT environment. Here IoT sub-\ngroups are having objects/sensors in it, and master node\nworking as a broker is randomly selected. Scheduler is running\nat the broker which is selecting the messages sent from the\nincoming stream of messages from all of the members of its\nsubgroup. We have considered Shortest processing time first\nalgorithm here and this considers the energy efficiency in term\nof routing as well.\nThe simulation results have shown the effectiveness and the\nefficiency of the proposed message scheduling algorithm both\nin terms of service response time and energy consumption.\n315\nThe immediate future work is to apply the same scheduling\ninto multi-hop routing where brokers are communicating with\neach other, to find optimal routes to the base station. However\nsame work could also be revised considering the priority of\nincoming messages and then scheduling them according to\ntheir respective priorities.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\n”The work in this paper was partly supported by UK EPSRC\nProject DANCER EP/K002643/1  of Things.” In Intelligent Computation Technology and Automation\n\(ICICTA on, pp. 197-200.

Table III shows the conversion time and running\ntime of METIS. The conversion time of DBLP is about 7.5\nhours even though it has the smallest number of triples. It\ntook about 35 hours to convert the Freebase to a METIS\ninput ?le. We believe that this is because there are much more\nvertices which are connected to a huge number of vertices on\nFreebase and DBLP as shown in Fig. 4\(e existing\ngraph partitioning tools require similar input formats, this\nresult indicates that the graph partitioning-based distribution\ntechnique may be infeasible for some RDF datasets.\nTABLE III: Graph partitioning time \(sec 27218 130\nFreebase 91826 2610\nDBpedia 3055 504\nFig. 6 shows, for different building blocks, the ratio of the\ntotal number of triples of all generated partitions to that of\nthe original RDF data. A large ratio means that many triples\nare replicated across the cluster of machines through the data\npartitioning. Partitions using the 1-hop extended out-vertex or\nin-vertex blocks have 1 as the ratio because each triple is\nassigned to only one partition based on its subject or object\nrespectively. As we mentioned above, the results show that\nthe graph partitioning-based distribution technique can reduce\nthe number of replicated triples considerably, compared to the\nhashing-based technique. This is because the graph partitioner\ngenerates components in which close vertices, which have\nhigh probability to share some triples in their extended vertex\nblocks, are assigned to the same component. Especially, there\nare only a few replicated triples for the 2-hop extended out-\nvertex blocks. However, for the other extended vertex blocks,\nthe reduction is not so signi?cant if we consider the overhead\nof the graph partitioning-based distribution technique.\nD. Query Processing\nTo evaluate query processing performance on the generated\npartitions, we choose different queries from one benchmark\ndataset \(LUBM2000 DBpedia a set of benchmark queries,\nwe select three among them. Note that Q11 and Q13 are\nslightly changed because our focus is not RDF reasoning.\nWe create three queries for DBpedia because there is no\nrepresentative benchmark queries.\nFig. 7 shows the query processing time of the queries for\nTABLE IV: Queries\nLUBM Q11: SELECT ?x ?y WHERE { ?x <subOrganizationOf> ?y .\n?y <subOrganizationOf> <http://www.University0.edu>}\nLUBM Q13: SELECT ?x WHERE { ?x <rdf:type> <GraduateStudent> .\n?x <undergraduateDegreeFrom> <http://www.University0.edu> }\nLUBM Q14: SELECT ?x WHERE { ?x <rdf:type> <UndergraduateStudent>}\nDBpedia Q1: SELECT ?subject ?similar WHERE n<Barack Obama> <subject> ?subject. ?similar <subject> ?subject. }\nDBpedia Q2: SELECT ?person WHERE { ?person rdf:type> <Person>}\nDBpedia Q3: SELECT ?suc2 ?suc1 ?person WHERE {\n?suc2 <successor> ?suc1 . ?suc1 successor> ?person}\ndifferent building blocks and different distribution techniques.\nAll building blocks ensure intra-VM processing for LUBM\nQ14 and DBpedia Q2 because they are simple retrieval queries\nhaving only one triple pattern. For LUBM Q13, random, 1-in\nand 2-in needs inter-VM processing using Hadoop because\nQ13 is a star query and so all triples sharing the same\nsubject should be located in the same partition for intra-VM\nprocessing. On the other hand, for DBpedia Q1 which is a\nreverse star query where all triple patterns share the same\nobject, random, 1-out and 2-out needs inter-VM processing.\nFor LUBM Q11 and DBpedia Q3 where the object of one\ntriple pattern is linked to the subject of the other triple pattern,\ninter-VM processing is required for random, 1-out and 1-\nin. The results clearly show that using inter-VM processing\nis slower than using intra-VM processing because of the\ncommunication cost across the cluster of machines to join\nintermediate results generated from subqueries. Furthermore,\neach Hadoop job usually has about 10 seconds of initialization\noverhead regardless of its input data size. In terms of the intra-\nVM processing, the difference between the hashing-based\nand the graph partitioning-based distribution techniques is not\nsigni?cant for most cases even though they have different\nbalance and replication levels as shown in Table I and Fig. 6.\nWe think that this is because each partition is ef?ciently stored\nand indexed in the RDF-speci?c storage system, thus such\nlevel of difference on the balance and replication does not\nhave a great effect on query processing. The only notable\ndifference is when we use 2-out for partitioning because\nthe graph partitioning-based technique reduces the number of\nreplicated triples considerably. Especially, on DBpedia where\n2-out using the hashing-based distribution technique generates\nmany replicated triples, 2-out using the 


graph partitioning-\nbased distribution technique is three times faster than that\nusing the hashing-based technique for DBpedia Q3.\nIn summary, we conclude that the most important factor of\nRDF data partitioning is to ensure the intra-VM processing\n333\n01\n2\n3\n4\n1-out 1-in 1-bi 2-out 2-in\nR\nep\nlic\nat\nio\nn \nR\nat\nio\n Hashing-based\nGraph partitioning-based\n\(a 2-in\nR\nep\nlic\nat\nio\nn \nR\nat\nio\n Hashing-based\nGraph partitioning-based\n\(b 1-in 1-bi 2-out 2-in\nR\nep\nlic\nat\nio\nn \nR\nat\nio\n Hashing-based\nGraph partitioning-based\n\(c DBLP\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n1-out 1-in 1-bi 2-out 2-in\nR\nep\nlic\nat\nio\nn \nR\nat\nio\n Hashing-based\nGraph partitioning-based\n\(d Hashing-based\nGraph partitioning-based\n\(e Replication\n1\n10\n100\n1000\nQ13\n\(hashing graph hashing graph hashing graph y\n P\nro\nce\nss\nin\ng \nTi\nm\ne \nin\n S\nec\n  \nrandom 1-out\n1-in 1-bi\n2-out 2-in\n\(a LUBM2000\n1\n10\n100\n1000\nQ1\n\(hashing graph hashing graph hashing graph P\nro\nce\nss\nin\ng \nTi\nm\ne \nin\n S\nec\n  \nrandom 1-out\n1-in 1-bi\n2-out 2-in\n\(b Time \(sec or most slower than intra-\nVM processing.

RELATED WORK\nGraph partitioning has been extensively studied in several\ncommunities for several decades [13], [15]. Recently a number\nof techniques have been proposed to process RDF queries on\na cluster of machines. Most of them utilize existing distributed\n?le systems such as HDFS to store and distribute RDF data.\nSHARD [19] directly stores RDF triples in HDFS as ?at text\n?les and runs one Hadoop job for each clause \(triple pattern  store\nRDF triples and, given a query, iteratively evaluates each triple\npattern of the query on the two tables to generate ?nal results.\nBecause they use general distributed ?le systems which are not\noptimized for RDF data, their query processing is much less\nef?cient than the state-of-the-art RDF storage and indexing\ntechnology [18]. [14] generates partitions using existing graph\npartitioning algorithms and stores them on RDF-3X. As we\nreported in Sec. IV, running an existing graph partitioner for\nlarge RDF data has a huge amount of overhead and is not\nfeasible for some real RDF datasets.\nIn addition, two recent papers [17], [16 have proposed\ntwo different approaches to general processing of big graph\ndata. [17] promotes to store a vertex and all its outgoing\nedges together and implemented a distributed system to show\nthe parallel processing opportunity of their approach. [16]\nproposes to store a vertex and all its incoming edges together\nand shows that this can speed up some graph processing on a\nsingle server, such as PageRank. In comparison, [17] presents\na system built using out-vertex block for both subject and\nobject vertices, whereas 16] presents a single server solution\nusing the in-vertex block for both subject and object vertices.\nBoth are special cases of our SPA partitioner. We argue that\nour SPA framework presents a systematic approach to graph\npartitioning and is more general and easily con?gurable with\ncustomizable performance guarantee.\nVI CONCLUSION\nWe have presented SPA, an ef?cient and customizable\nRDF data partitioning model for distributed processing of\nbig RDF graph data in the Cloud. The main contribution is\nto develop a selection of scalable techniques to distribute the\npartition blocks across a cluster of compute nodes in a manner\nthat minimizes inter-node communication cost by localizing\nmost of the queries on distributed partitions. We show that\nthe SPA approach is not only ef?cient for partitioning and\ndistributing big RDF datasets of diverse sizes and structures\nbut also effective for processing RDF queries of different\ntypes and complexity.\nAcknowledgment This work is partially sponsored by grants\nfrom NSF CISE NetSE program, SaTC program, and Intel\nISTC on Cloud Computing.\nREFERENCES\n[1] “About FacetedDBLP,” http://dblp.l3s.de/dblp++.php.\n[2] “BTC 2012 Dataset http://km.aifb.kit.edu/projects/btc-2012/.\n[3] “DBpedia 3.8 Downloads http://wiki.dbpedia.org/Downloads38.\n[4] “METIS,” http://www.cs.umn.edu/˜metis.\n[5] “Opening up Government http://data.gov.uk/sparql.\n[6] “Resource Description Framework \(RDF  Data-gov Wiki,” http://data-gov.tw.rpi.edu/wiki.\n[8] “UK Legislation http://www.legislation.gov.uk/developer/formats/rdf.\n[9] S.

Hunter Peckham \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE Neuroprostheses for Movement Restoration \n \nAbstract: Major advances have been made over the past decade in use of neuropros-\ntheses for restoration of motor function.  These advances have been built on the fun-\ndamental science of neural excitation and the technologies for implantable stimulation \nand control. The technologies have advanced to provide operational systems that func-\ntion in the human body for decades, and include implantable electrodes, stimulation \ndevices, and sensors.  The neural interface between the excitable tissue and the delivery electrode are ena-\nbling evermore powerful control and precision in the delivery of stimulation, not only providing for excita-\ntion but also blocking of neural activity \(e.g. for annihilation of pain or spasticity interfaces are currently in development \nthat will provide greater flexibility in implementation and performance. \n \nThe clinical manifestations of these findings are the available systems that have been created, and are being \ndeveloped, to restore function.  These include many areas of the body for people with spinal cord injury, \nincluding hand grasp, standing and walking, breathing, and bladder and bowel control Several patients \nhave benefited from systems that enable more than one function \(e.g. hand function and bladder control restore full \narm mobility and levels of standing and ambulation.

Some are acted upon immedi-\nately, but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions -- our implicit "label-\ning" of the world. In this talk I will describe our work using physiological correlates of this labeling to con-\nstruct a hybrid brain-computer interface \(hBCI record electroencephalographic \(EEG part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate \nthe neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective inter-\nest. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using nsemi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to those that are labelled. \nFinally, the system plots an efficient route so that subjects visit similar objects of interest. We show that by \nexploiting the subjects' implicit labeling, the median search precision is increased from 25% to 97%, and the \nmedian subject need only travel 40% of the distance to see 84% of the objects of interest. We also find that \nthe neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers inference of subjects' \nimplicit labeling. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of ob-\njects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting \nin an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user's interests. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Paul Sajda is Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Radiol-\nogy at Columbia University and Director of the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing \n\(LIINC modeling and \nmachine learning applied to image understanding.

White \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Are Our Cellular Models Fundamentally Wrong? \n \nAbstract: The Hodgkin-Huxley model, arguably the greatest success story in the history \nof computational neuroscience, is the predecessor of thousands of existing cellular models \nthat span a significant range of levels of detail. Here, using electrophysiological, dynamic-\nclamp, and computational techniques, we demonstrate that many of the “gold standard” \nsingle-cell models, used by thousands of laboratories, fail to account correctly for the responses of well-studied \nexcitatory neurons to noise.  In particular, the input-output gain of entorhinal stellate cells and neocortical py-\nramidal cells is substantially less sensitive to noise than predicted by the models.  The major source of the dis-\ncrepancy is that the models fit measured peri-threshold voltage dynamics poorly.  Because noise is ubiquitous \nand prominent in the brain, and because neuronal gain is crucial for understanding a wide range of response nproperties at the cellular and network levels, we argue that this is an issue of fundamental importance. \n nBiographical Sketch:  John A.

Despite spending as little as 0.01% of their lives having seizures, people \nwith epilepsy take antiepileptic drugs \(AEDs ex-\nperience significant AED related side effects, and approximately 1/3 continue to have seizures. Mapping the \nbrain networks generating seizures is critical for successful epilepsy surgery, therapeutic brain stimulation, \nand seizure forecasting. In focal epilepsy the spontaneous, evoked, and induced brain activity is disrupted \nover a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. Multiscale electrophysiology recordings have uncovered a range \nof electrophysiological biomarkers, measurable interictal \(between seizures normal and \npathological tissue that show promise for spatiotemporal mapping of epileptogenic brain. In this talk we \nreview two potential applications of these multiscale biomarkers, epilepsy surgery and seizure forecasting.  \n \n Biographical Sketch:  Greg Worrell, MD, PhD is Chair of Clinical Neurophysiology, Director of Mayo Sys-\ntems Electrophysiology Laboratory \(MSEL prac-\ntice and research are focused on the evaluation and care of patients with medically resistant epilepsy nThrough MSEL he is currently pursuing the integration of large-scale neurophysiology, computing, and im-\naging for biomarker discovery.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
