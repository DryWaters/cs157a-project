Many organizations are faced with the problem of detecting whether or not  they have an anomaly in their network transactions. The Network Intrusion Detection System \(NIDS one of the popular tools used to secure and protect networks. In 
order to secure a network the signature rules in NIDS should be updated with the latest signature detection rule.  Therefore, this research aims to develop a network anomaly detection tool which focuses on association rule data mining techniques to detect anomalies and also produce anomaly detection rules.  The tool named as NASSR, consists of the following functions: preprocessing of the raw data network transaction that is captured using Wireshark and transforming the data into three types of data sets \(2, 5 and 10 seconds\, normalization \(min., max.\ and mining \(Appriori, Fuzzy Appriori, and FP-Growth\. The 
anomaly detection is calculated by comparing it with a normal network data set, which is validated by CACE tools. The data set is determined as having no intrusion, if the similarity results are higher than the user threshold, and vice versa. This paper also presents the interface tools used to analyse the 7GB real network data set obtained from Pusat Teknologi Maklumat \(PTM Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia \(UKM\ which consists of three days\222 accumulation of network traffic data, and presents the data sets that have anomalies and their rules.   The best result shows that the best technique for pre-processing is in the form of two seconds. Fuzzy Appriori  presents the most accurate result while 
FP-growth has been shown as a faster mining technique. The tools can be easily used to detect anomalies for any network traffic  Keywords 227 network intrusion detection system \(NIDS\ta Mining, Association Rules Techniques  I  I NTRODUCTION  Nowadays the number of computer networks keeps growing in parallel with transactions, especially on the Internet while streaming, video conferencing, chatting searching, etc. These various types of transactions introduce many intrusions and anomalies into the network Network traffic is often seen to display sudden deviations 
from normal behaviour. Some of these aberrations are caused by malicious network attacks such as Denial-Of-Service or viruses, whereas others are the result of equipment failures and accidental outages Many  m e th ods h a v e be en  developed by organizations and play very important roles to secure network infrastructure and communications via the Internet such as through the use of firewalls, anti-virus software packages and intrusion detection systems. Current firewalls cannot defend against every category of intrusion whereby some intrusions take advantages of computer system vulnerabilities [2 i n tr u s io n d e tectio n s y ste m ID S provides around-the-clock network observation and is an additional wall to secure the network 
The intrusion detection system is a process of determining an intrusion into a system through the observation of available information concerning the state of the system, monitoring user activities and reporting to a management station Intrusion detection refers to the detection of cruel activity break-ins, penetrations, and other forms of computer abuse in a computer-related system [3 T h eref ore, th e ID tec h niques  are classified into host-based and network-based depending on the type and source of information used to identify security breaches   d in g on t h e m e t h od of i n trus i o n  detection, IDS are classified into two main categories signature-based intrusion detection and anomaly-based intrusion detection. The signature detection system approach 
assumes that an intrusion can be detected by matching the current activity with a set of intrusions using patterns considered as misuse. Anomaly detection systems assume that an intrusion should deviate from the normal pattern of system behaviour i gn at u re det ect i o n  h a s a  m a j o r dra w back w i t h  the failure to detect novel attacks and requires constant updating and modification for new attack signatures by domain experts Currently there are many data mining tools available in the market, either on a commercial basis or for free. Most data mining tools support a data mining task such as classification association rules and clustering. Data mining tools are developed for the expert. The existing data mining is not 
designed for the novice user especially when network engineers detect an anomaly in their network. Therefore, this paper aims to present association anomaly detection tools that can be used by a network engineer to detect anomalies in their network easily.  The tools read the network traffic data preprocessing it and then presenting the result, showing which data set has high intrusion, and its rules.  The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: section two discusses related work concerning association rules, association rules for NIDS, current data mining tools and the association rule techniques that were used in this research. Section three describes the experiment setup, which includes data collection 


pre-processing and mining. Section four shows some snapshots of user interface of the system, while section five shows an analytical result of intrusion detection using PTM network traffic data set. Finally, the conclusions are presented II  RELATED  WORKS One of the popular methods used for mining data in KDD Knowledge Discovery in Database\o discover patterns is association rule mining. It has attracted the attention of many current data-mining researchers because of its capability to discover useful and interesting patterns from large, noisy fuzzy, stochastic data [8 Th e related  w o rk is o r g a n i zed as follows A  Basic Concept Of Association Rules Association rule mining discovers frequent patterns associations, correlations, or causal structures among huge groups of items or objects in transaction databases, relational databases, and other information repositories h a s be en developed by Agrawal n order t o s t u d y cus t o m ers 222 purchasing behavior in supermarkets where goods are often purchased together by customers. The brief of the basic concept of association rules in transactional and relational databases is presented as follows I i 1 i 2 i 3 205,i n is a set of items; let DB be a set of database transactions where every transaction T is a set of items such that T I Each transaction is associated with a unique, transaction identifier \(TID Let X  Y be a set of items, an association rule is an inference of the form X Y where X I  Y I and X Y 370 X is called the antecedent of the rule, and Y is called the consequent of the rule. An itemset containing i items is called an i itemset The rule X Y holds in the transaction set D with Support S  which is the percentage of transactions that contain both an itemset X and Y appearing in the same transaction  For an itemset to be interesting, its support must be higher than a user-specified minimum. Such itemsets are said to be frequent We have the Support of the rule X Y as in Equation \(1 Support\(X Y  P  X 002 Y 1 There is another measure called Confidence C where C is the ratio of the number of transactions in D that contains X  and Y to the number of transactions that contain only X as in Equation \(2 Confidence  X Y  P  Y  X  Support  X 002 Y  Support  X 2 Association rule mining is the process of finding all the association rules that pass the condition of min. support and min. confidence. In order to mine these rules, first the support and confidence values have to be computed for all of the rules and then compare them with the threshold values to prune the rules with low values of either support or confidence B  Association Rule For Network Intrusion Detection Association rules based on the IDS attempt to classify all the traffic as either normal or malicious. There are many association rule techniques which are available and some are shown in Table 1. Wang [1 ha s fo und t ha t  A p r i o r i  fuz z y Apriori and FP-growth presented the best association rule mining techniques.  Besides, these techniques have been proved as the best association rules for IDS [8,9  TABLE1 T HE LIST OF TECHNIQUES IN THE ASSOCIATION RULE METHOD FOR NIDS  C  Existing Data Mining Tools Data mining tools  are those used to discover knowledge from a large data set. Current data mining tools are generalpurpose. It requires the user to have certain knowledge of data mining in order for him/her to be able to use the tools Domain experts with less data mining knowledge face difficulty in using the tools. More than 50 data mining tools are available either commercially or for free.  Table 2 shows some current data mining tools, which can be differentiated by various criteri u ch as  Pl at f o r m s  S u pport e d, A l g o ri t h ms such as Decision Trees, Neural Networks and Others, Data Input and Model Output Options, Usability Ratings Author DM algorithms Type of data Finding 5  Apriori Fuzzy Apriori DARAP\222 99 Association rule can be for intrusion detection combines association with a complementary decision tree scheme that helps to identify attributes of relevance  Apriori FP-growth wired and wireless network data Reviews the new development of association rule mining technologies for ID in wired and wireless networks  Apriori Fuzzy Apriori Real-life database They present the FARM algorithm which employs linguistic terms.

Visualization Capabilities, and Modelling Automation Methods Not all the data mining tools provide association rule algorithms such as Rosetta and Neural Connection. Among them Weka, Tanagra and Keel do provide comprehensive free supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms and data preprocessing. Most of the steps are similar when pre-processing the network data to handle the intrusion based on association rules mining but the difference with these tools is that the user should do most of the steps manually, which means that these tools are tedious and time-consuming and that the user should know the data mining process well  T ABLE 2    S OME OF D ATA M INING T OOLS   Some of the pre-processing steps are not included in the data mining tools when the data mining has to be done manually such as to Select the packets of network traffic data based on the time period \(split data into several groups\e user can do this step manually using Excel or other programmes, which is very tedious and time-consuming especially when the data is large in size.  Besides, analysis of the rules that are obtained form association rule algorithms by measuring the similarity between the rules based on the user threshold is also tedious In order to get the best association rules, the data needs to be mined using several association rule techniques. Therefore several experiments are conducted using several association rules to get best result, which also renders this task tedious III  P ROPOSED TOOLS  The proposed anomaly association rules anomaly detection tool model consists of four components: Pre-processing network data, Setting Options, Association Rules techniques and Analysis phase as shown in figure. 1 Each phase has several functions. The description of each function of each component is as follows                       Fix ed  Set  Sett in g Anal y sis  Experiments  Mining Results Database Comparison result in Graph st y le Fuzz y A pp riori  A pp riori FP-Growth Normalize Database Category Setting Fuzzy Set Setting  Normalization categories fixed set fuzzy set Database Network data Transformation data Generate Data   raw data network  plain text data network Analysis Phase Association rules techniques Phase Setting Option Phase Preprocessing Phas e 


Figure 1. Network Anomaly Association Rules Tools \(NASSR\ Architecture  The Preprocessing component consists of two functions the  Transformation Data function and the Generation Data function  200  For the Transformation Data Component, after the data is captured, the data must be transformed from binary data into plain text data. Statistical calculation is performed 200  For the Generation Data Component, this firstly extracts the data based on 6 most popular network features for anomaly detection such as SYN, FIN and RST type of TCP flags, source IP addresses, destination IP addresses and total packets   T h e s econ d  f u n c tio n is preprocessing the data into three types of data set: 2, 5 and 10second window slices. In each data type will be calculated the total number of different source IP addresses performing transactions within the range, the total number of different destination IP addresses within the range and the total of packet sizes within the range. Three types of data sets are generated  The Setting Option component provides the function of offering setup preferences before mining the data. Three setting options are provided for the normalization process The first setting option is to set the category of data based on time slots when data is captured. The second setting sets the range of values for the Appriori and FP-Growth approaches which will be covered later under visualization tools. The last setting is to set the range of values for the Fuzzy Appriori as low, medium or high  The  Mining component consists of the three unsupervised association rules techniques, namely Appriori, Fuzzy Appriori, and FP-Growth normalized data set is from mining using all the three association rules techniques  The Analysis component provides the function of performing the comparison between the normal results against tested results based on the similarity measurement This component also provides a comparison of results shown in simple graphical style  IV  I MPLEMENTATION 0 F PTM 222 S NETWORK TRAFFIC DATA   This section shows a snapshot of the intrusion detection process using the proposed tools for Pusat Teknologi Maklumat \(PTM\, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia \(UKM The real network traffic dataset for 3 days of network traffic starting from July, 13 th 2009 at 17:30:39 until July, 15th 2009 at 13:29:59, with 27,918,524 records in 348 files. The data was captured using Wireshark tools. The data is then converted into plain text data which can use Windump tools [24 t o di s p l a y  the TCP/IP packets. Figure. 2 shows the main menu of the NASSR tools  Data Preparation Data preparation is conducted manually.  The data is divided into n number of data sets. For PTMs the data set is divided into four data sets \(Test-1 to Test-4\d one data set is the normal data set which has been proved by experts or by using the CACE Pilot tools. This tool is the latest commercial visualization, charting, reporting, and "drill-down" tool used to analyze networks a bl e 2 s h o w s  t h e di s t ri bu t i o n of d a t a  for the PTM data set   Figure 2.

Figure. 3 shows the user interface of preprocessing the data set into 2 seconds, 5 seconds and 10 seconds.

The process  converts the continuous data to categorical data using the maximum-minimum normalization approach for Apriori and FP-growth, while for Fuzzy Apriori the process uses fuzzy set to describe the linguistics for all variables with domains [0,1 d a rd  membership function for the fuzzy variable is used [5 0   Figure. 4 shows an example of a setting option for fuzzy set The Mining phase: Each dataset \(eg. Test-1 with 2 second slice window\hen mined using three association rule algorithms to establish the association rules pattern Figure 5 Category Time slots when data sets are collected 13/07 14/07 15/07 Normal 00:00:00 \226 06:00:00 20:00:01 \226 24:00:00       Tested-1 06:00:01 \226 09:00:00    Tested-2 09:00:01 \226 13:00:00    Tested-3 13:00:01 \226 17:00:00    Tested-4 17:00:01 \226 20:00:00   


The Anomaly is detected by comparing the rules of a normal category dataset with the rules of tested category datasets based on similarity measurements   Figure 3. Preprocessing the data set into 3 type data sets  Figure 4.  Example of Setting Options for Fuzzy Set   Analysis: The experiment results of the ID for the PTM\222s data evaluation were based on similarity between the rules using the three techniques in Figure 6. These rules were acquired by applying association rule techniques for network traffic data called anomaly association rules that were used to determine whether there was an intrusion or not in the data through a similarity measurement based on user threshol  There are three types of results presented in this paper showing which association rules techniques and pre-processing techniques produce the best model, which PTM datasets have anomalies, and  Comparison results from our tool with existing DM tools The results are displayed in Table 4 and Figure 7 for 2second datasets; three approaches in association rules were performed to obtain the similarity measurement between normal category dataset and the four tested datasets   Figure 5. Appriori Mining User Interface   Figure 6.  Analysis Visualized  User Interface  Table 4 displays the fact that that Fuzzy Appriori obtained lower accuracy detection than Appriori and FP-Growth for Tested-1 and Tested-2. The values are lower than the predefined user threshold value \(0.5\Thus, Tested-1 and Tested-2 considered has intrusion. Subsequently, for Tested-3 and Tested-4, the Fuzzy Appriori displays results higher than Appriori and FP-Growth. Since the values for Tested-3 and Tested-4 are higher than the predefined user threshold value that dataset is considered to have no intrusion

In each stage, some of the items were imported to the random graph By importing of each item to the graph, the learning automata will be active and up date its probability of application as a=0.5 in accordance with relation 1; it will continue up to when all of the subsets of the customers shopping set were examined Finally, this method was examined on online database of Mushroom and customers shopping basket data. Mushroom database has 22 fields and 8123 records that states properties of mushroom in different modes and was obtain from the UCI machine learning database  data has 30 fields and 88159 records that contain of 16450 items. This file contains transactions from a Belgian retail store [24]. The present method was implemented for investigation of alternative patterns of a set with n members For implementing of simulation program, programming language of C++ Standard Template Library with 2GB RAM CPU core2Dua 2.00 GHz and windows XP SP/2 operating system. Its results are presented in figures 4, 5 in comparison with other methods. This work was done by different supports and demonstrates better results and efficiency of the suggested method Figure 4.

CONCLUSION In the present study, distributed learning automata method was examined for sequence pattern mining in a set of sequence data. This method could assist in a great extent to suppliers of goods or shop owners in finding sequence of the customers shopping. We demonstrated that by this method we are able to extract in two-member, three-member n-member that have had the most iteration and provide them to the shop owners for decision making and accurate arrangements of goods in the shelves. It was compared with other methods and its results show higher efficiency of the proposed method than the other ones. Finding of the categories leads to increase of satisfaction of the customers in shopping, increase of the stores profits and decrease of the customers  confusion in finding their necessary products

Judging by common sense, the High threshold is defined as follows: for sections with one lane , if there exist 2 or more cars in 10 meters, then it is a High volume situation. On the other hand, the middle threshold is defined as follows: for sections with one lane, if there exist more than 1, and less than 2 cars in 10 meters, it is a Middle volume situation. The remains will be discretized to Low traffic volume situation The cars are randomly generated based on the values of the pre-defined OD\(OringinJDestination for every OD pair is changing during the execution as shown in Fig.6 lY l Jl .? 15 co ? 10 Xl 5 Q O .r:: 0 o 50 100  150 T:in e 4n ilutes Fig. 6.

Total number of rules extracted In order to check the effectiveness of the extracted rules we tested the classification accuracy of the proposed method using the classifier with competition The average prediction accuracy is shown in Table V. The accuracy is defined in the following: if the traffic prediction result of the section at time t is "Low" and the real traffic of this section at time t is exactly "Low", then the accuracy is 100%. The low/middle/high accuracy means the accuracy when the real traffic is low/middle/high, respectively Table V shows that the method with Accuracy Validation can improve the overall accuracy than the method without Accuracy Validation. The Middle volume of the traffic network can not be predicted accurately because the middle situations do not appear frequently enough to generate an enough number of association rules TABLE V AVERAGE PREDICTION ACCURACY FOR TESTING DATABASE Method Prediction Accuracy Overall Low Middle High With Accuracy Validation 84.82 85.84 57.71 89.71 Without Accuracy Validation 82.64 83.57 56.57 87.13 Longer step prediction is explored by studying the 2-step, 3step and 4-step prediction, where n-step means the prediction of the traffic volume at n time points later. It's results are shown in Fig. 8. It is shown from Fig.8 that the prediction accuracy decreases as the number of prediction step increases but the increase of the number of steps does not affect the overall accuracy so much, so the proposed method can do relative stable prediction even if the number of prediction steps Increases The ratio of the usable rules to the total number of rules in each prediction step is shown in Fig.9, which describes that 


how the number of the usable rules for prediction decreases by the increase of the prediction steps, considering the condition that the time delay between the antecedent part and consequent part should be bigger or equal to the prediction step. In another word, as the prediction step increases, the number of the usable rules decreases 86 if G 84 82 80 f-------?-""":__---------1 0:: 78 r-------------">.-======---1 :? 76 -------------------j 74 72 4 n-6tep I?w ihAcCUlacyValiiarnn -w ihoutAcCUlacyValiiarnn I Fig. 8.

The mechanism of Accuracy Validation shows more stable performances as shown in Fig. 8 V. CONCLUSION In this paper, an association rule mining method using GNP with Accuracy Validation mechanism has been proposed. It is clarified from simulations that the proposed method can extract important time-related association rules for each class of the consequent attributes efficiently. What's more important is that these rules can be used to decide to which class the time related data belong accurately. From simulations, we have also 


found that the proposed method can be used in traffic volume prediction problems. Further improvements of the proposed method is studied in terms of applying the proposed method to real world navigation systems REFERENCES I Vehicle Routing and Congestion Predictions for Real-time Driver Guid ance, Transportation Research Records, 1408, Transportation Research Board, Washington D.C., pp. 66-74, 1993 2 October 17, 1989 3 network predictions, In Proc. of the Conference of Canadian Society of Civil Engineers, Sherbrooke, Quebec, June, pp. 331-339, 1997 4 dynamic traffic networks with joint route and departure time choice.

encountering a related term, i.e. IC\(c e intuition behind the use of the negative likelihood is that the more probable a term to appear, the less information it conveys. All these features show that Jiangs measure tends to be more general and more appropriate for evaluating nontaxonomically related terms. Indeed, a high score of the relatedness measures suggests a strong relationship between terms Nevertheless, all relatedness measures have limitations because they assume that all the semantic content of a particular term is modeled by semantic links in WordNet Consequently, in many situations, truly related terms obtain a low scores even though their belongings to a certain category of tags, e.g., jargon tags Additionally, when measuring the quality of an automatically knowledge acquisition results, the typical measures used in Information Retrieval are Recall, Precision and F-Measure. However, computing Recall and F-Measure requires the availability of a Gold Standard. Hence, we will only compute the Precision which speci?es to which extent the non-taxonomic relationships is extracted correctly. In this case, the ratio between the correctly extracted relations i.e., their relatedness measures is greater than or equal to a minimum threshold, and the whole number of extracted ones is computed. Thus, we have Precision Total correctly selected entities Total selected entities 12 http://search.cpan.org/dist/WordNet-Similarity 13 A term refers to a tag subject or a tag object C. Evaluation of non-taxonomic relationships Only a percentage of the full set of non-taxonomic relationships \(89 is caused by the presence of non standard terms which are not contained in WordNet and, in consequence, cannot be evaluated using WordNet-based relatedness measures. Fig. 5 depicts the evaluation results of the extracted non-taxonomic relationships against their relatedness measures High relatedness score \(88 17% of the extracted relationships, as most of terms are strongly related with respect WordNet Null Scores were obtained for 5% of the extracted 


relationships. Analyzing this case in more detail, we have observed that the poor score is caused in many situations by the way in which Jiangs distance metric works. This latter completely depends on the distance between two terms based on the number of edges found on the path between them in WordNet. In consequence this measure returns a value that does not fully represent reality. For example, on the one hand, Jiangs distance metric returns a null value for the relationship between insurance and car, even though the ?rst is a commonly related to the second, i.e., car involved insurance Finally with a minimal Jiangs distance metric threshold, set to 46%, the computed precision of correctly extracted relationships candidates is equal to 68.8 An example of extracted non-taxonomic relationships is depicted in Table V where each relation describes the subject tag, e.g., tool, the predicate, e.g is being developed within, and the object tag, e.g mesh. Fig. 4 represent a fragment output of the extracted ontological structure where each concept de?nes a set of similar and synonym tags and labels, i.e., mentions has been, revealed, caused and is created with describe the predicates of the non-taxonomic relationships between terms Due to the limitations observed by the automatic evaluation procedure and the lack of gold standards containing non-taxonomic relationships, we have examined the extracted non-taxonomic relationships from a linguistic point 377 Top space      distance     quad great     groovy nifty caused address      addresses extension      quotation   reference  references extensions        referenz     source      refrence sources    rfrences    quotations research    search     searching searchs open-source     open_source

This qualitative evaluation can bring some interesting insights about the kind of results one can expect Invalid relations are extracted: Even though a relation such as music cities skill is considered as correct one since tag subject, tag object and predicate are correctly extracted. From a semantic point of view, this relation has no meaning. Hence, a higher precision is expected Figure 5. Summary of non-taxonomic evaluation measure Table V EXAMPLES OF EXTRACTED NON TAXONOMIC RELATIONSHIPS Subject Predicate Object search has been reference reference mentions search tool is being developed within mesh security added encoding search revealed reference java provides library by performing the sense analysis on complete relations An ambiguity in the extracted predicates between terms is observed: Hence, same relations are redundant since they use a synonym predicates between terms, e.g java provides library and java yields library. Thus we expect that the redundancy removal within extracted relations will be of bene?t for the improvement of the 


obtained results VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK The extraction of non-taxonomic relationships from folksonomies is to the best of our knowledge is the least tackled task within ontology building from folksonomy. This is why there is a need of novel and general purpose approaches covering the full process of learning relationships. In this paper, we introduced a new approach called NONTAXFOLKS that starts by pre-processing tags aiming at getting a set of frequent tagsets corresponding to an agreed representation Then, they are used to retrieve related tags using external resources such as WordNet. Thanks to the particular structure of triadic concepts, it allows grouping semantically related tags by considering the semantic relatedness embodied in the different frequencies of co-occurences among users, resources and tags in the folksonomy. Thereafter we introduced an algorithm called NTREXTRACTION for extracting non-taxonomic relationships between pair of tags picked from the triadic concepts. In summary, our approach uses several well known techniques \(such as formal concept analysis or association rule discovering the social bookmaring environnement in order to propose a new way of extracting labeled non-taxonomic relationships between tags. Currently, we are investigating the following topic concerning the discovered predicates between two terms. Indeed, in order to avoid relationships redundancy and thus a redundancy in the builded ontology. One can try to classify them into prede?ned semantic classes, detect synonyms, inverses, etc. A standard classi?cation of verbs could be used for this purpose, adding additional information about the semantic content, e.g., senses, verb types, thematic roles, etc., of predicates relationships 378 REFERENCES 1] J.
