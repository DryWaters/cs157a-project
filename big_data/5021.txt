paper presents the process of analyzing network traffic captured by Pusat Teknologi Maklumat \(PTM\ to detect whether it has any anomalies or not and to produce corresponding anomaly rules to be included in an update of UKM\222s NIDS. The network traffic data was collected using WireShark for three days, using the six most common network attributes. The experiment used three association rule data mining techniques known as Appriori, Fuzzy Appriori and FPGrowth based on two, five and ten second window slicing.  Out of the four data-sets, data-sets one and two were detected to 
have anomalies. The results show that the Fuzzy Appriori algorithm presented the best quality result, while FP-Growth presented a faster time to reach a solution. The data-sets, which was pre-processed in the form of two second window slicing displayed better results. This research outlines the steps that can be utilized by an organization to capture and detect anomalies using association rule data mining techniques to enhance the quality their of NIDS  Keywords: network intrusion de tection system \(NIDS\ta Mining; Association Rules Techniques  I  INTRODUCTION 
  Nowadays the number of computer network keeps growing in parallel with transactions, especially on the internet while streaming, video conferencing, chatting searching, etc. These various types of transactions introduce many intrusions and anomalies to the network. This situation is occurring at UKM. The PTM is responsible for network security at UKM  Network traffic is often seen to display sudden deviations from normal behaviour. Some of these aberrations are caused by malicious network attacks such as Denial-OfService or viruses, whereas others are the result of equipment failures and accidental outages  methods have been developed by organizations and play 
very important roles to secure network infrastructures and communications via the internet such as firewalls, anti-virus software packages and intrusion detection systems. Current firewalls cannot defend against every category of intrusion in which some intrusions take advantages of computer system vulnerabilities [2 An i n tr u s io n d e tectio n s y s t e m  IDS\ provides around-the-clock network observation and is an additional wall to secure the network   The intrusion detection system is a process of determining an intrusion into a system through the observation of available information concerning the state of the system, monitoring 
user activities and reporting to a management station Intrusion detection refers to the detection of cruel activity break-ins, penetrations, and other forms of computer abuse in a computer related system h eref ore, th e I D  techniques are classified into host-based and network-based depending on the type and source of information used to identify security breaches   Depen d in g on the method of intrusion detection, IDS are classified into two main categories; signature based intrusion detection and anomaly based intrusion detection. The signature detection systems approach assumes that an intrusion can be detected by matching the current activity with a set of intrusive using patterns considered as misuse; Anomaly detection systems 
assume that an intrusion should deviate system behaviour from its normal pattern [7 23  Sig n a t u re d e tectio n h a s a major drawback with the failure to detect novel attacks and requires constant updating and modification of new attack signatures by domain experts  This paper aims to present the steps to identify anomaly pattern using association rules for UKM network traffic. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: section two discusses related work concerning association rules association rules for NIDS and the association rule techniques that were used in this research. Section three describes the experiment setup, which includes data collection, pre-processing and mining. The experiment 
results are discussed in section four. Finally, presents the conclusions II  RELATED  WORKS One of the popular methods used for mining data in KDD \(Knowledge Discovery in Database  to discover patterns is association rule mining. It has attracted the attention of many current data-mining researchers because of its  capability to discover useful and interesting patterns from

The brief of the basic concept of association rules in transactional and relational databases is presented as follows I i 1 i 2 i 3 205,i n is a set of items, Let DB be a set of database transactions where every transaction T is a set of items such that T I Each transaction is associated with a unique, transaction identifier \(TID Let X  Y be a set of items, an association rule is an inference of the form X Y where X I  Y I and X Y 370 X  is called the antecedent of the rule, and Y is called the consequent of the rule. An itemset containing i itemset called an i itemset. The rule X Y holds in the transaction set D  with Support S which is the percentage of transactions that contain both an itemset X and Y appearing in the same transaction  For an itemset to be interesting, its support must be higher than a user-specified minimum. Such itemsets are said to be frequent. We have the Support of the rule X Y as in Equation \(1  Support\(X Y  P  X 002 Y   1  There is another measure called Confidence C where C  is the ratio of the number of transactions in D that containing X and Y to the number of transactions that contain only X as Equation \(2  Confidence  X Y  P  Y  X  Support  X 002 Y  Support  X 2 Association rule mining is the process of finding all the association rules that pass the condition of min support and min confidence. In order to mine these rules first the support and confidence values have to be computed for all of the rules and then compare them with the threshold values to prune the rules with low values of either support or confidence. In general association rule can be summarized in two steps  200  Use the large itemsets to produce the association rules for the database that has confidence above a predetermined minimum threshold B  Association Rule For Network Intrusion Detection Association rules based on the IDS attempt to classify all the traffic as either normal or malicious. The table 1 below lists the most popular techniques for the association rule method within the network anomaly detection domain T ABLE 1  T HE LIST OF TECHNIQUES IN THE ASSOCIATION RULE METHOD FOR NIDS  Apart from the aforementioned analysis, Wang [10 als o f i n d  that Apriori, fuzzy Apriori and FP-growth can be the most representative algorithms for association rule mining C  Association Rule  Techniques In association rules there are many techniques. In this research we chose the most popular techniques that are utilized in NIDS as follows  a  Apriori algorithm Introduced by Agrawal [9 A p ri o r i is th e m o st im p o rt an t  algorithm for mining frequent itemsets for Boolean association rules in a given database. It uses the property: all nonempty subsets of a frequent itemset must also be frequent 8   The key idea of Apriori algorithm is to make multiple passes over the database. It employs an iterative approach known as a breadth-first search \(level-wise search\ through the search space, where k itemsets are used to explore k+1 itemsets. In the beginning, the set of frequent 1-itemsets is found. The set contains one item, satisfying the support Author DM algorithms Type of data Finding 5  Apriori Fuzzy Apriori DARAP\222 99 Association rule can be for intrusion detection combines association with a complementary decision tree scheme that helps to identify attributes of relevance  Apriori FP-growth wired and wireless network data Reviews the new development of association rule mining technologies for ID in wired and wireless network  Apriori Fuzzy Apriori Real-life database They present FARM algorithm which employs linguistic terms. FARM has unique features that are able to find positive and negative association  Apriori Fuzzy Apriori Classification algorithm KDD 99 dataset New classification approach that uses fuzzy association rulesets as descriptive modles of different classes  Apriori, Fuzzy Association Rule based on prefix trees DARAP\222 99 They improved a genetic algorithm to optimize the fuzzy association rules  Apriori Fuzzy Apriori Genetic Algorithms Network traffic data Fuzzy association rules can be mined to find the abstract correlation among different security features  Apriori Fuzzy Association Rule Network traffic data Detecting intrusion is effective by using Fuzzy Association Rule and the accuracy has improved 200  Find the large itemsets, i.e., the sets of items that have transaction support above a predetermined minimum threshold

This seed set is used to develop new potentially large itemsets, called candidate itemsets and to count the actual support for these candidate itemsets during the pass over the data. At the end of the pass, we decide which of the candidate itemsets are actually large \(frequent and they become the seed for the next pass Therefore L1 is used to find L2 the set of frequent 2itemsets, which is used to find L3 and so on, until no more frequent k itemsets can be found. Then, a very significant property called Apriori property is employed to reduce the search space. Expressly, the Apriori algorithm consists of join and prune steps [8  Join step This step generates new candidate k itemsets based on joining L k-1  with itself which is found in the previous iteration Prune step This step eliminates some of the candidate k itemsets using the Apriori property b  Fuzzy Apriori Srikant & Agrawal [16  have proposed mining quantitative association rules in large relational tables. The algorithm extracts the association rules by partitioning the attribute domain and combining adjacent partitions, and then transforms the problem into a binary one. Even though this method can solve problems introduced by infinite domains it generates the sharp boundary problem. We either overlook or overemphasize the elements near the boundaries in the mining process. As a result we may miss some interesting rules because of the excluding of elements near the sharp boundaries. To address this deficiency, Fuzzy association rules mining was studied by many researchers   15 5  T h e al g o ri t h m di s c u s s e s as  f o l l o w   Assume T t 1 t 2 t n to be the database, and each transaction t i represent the ith tuple in T In addition I i 1  i 2 i m is employed to represent all items appearing in T  Each quantitative item i k 1 k m is coupled with some fuzzy variables, say v 1 v 2 v j Each fuzzy variable is represented by a membership function. For easy representation in the following F ik  vj uniquely denote the jth membership function of item i k  In fuzzy association rule mining, a fuzzy item set contains two parts: items and fuzzy variables, represented as X,V  where X x 1 x 2 x i   I is a group of items \(or features and V v 1 v 2 v i s the group of corresponding fuzzy variables to X in order. Sup X,V is the sum of votes satisfying X,V divided by the number of records in T as Equation \(3\ The support of X,V is calculated as [17      Where t i x j  represents the value of feature x j of the ith record, and T denotes the total number of records. as a replacement for \221\221If X then Y 222\222 in association rule, a fuzzy association rule now has the form of \221\221If X,V then  X V 222\222. Here X,V and X V are two itemsets X I  X I and X X  The first part X,V is called an antecedent, and the second part X V is called a consequent. Likewise, support S and Confidence C of the fuzzy association rule X,V   X V are calculated as  S  Sup  Y,U d  C  Sup  Y,U  Sup  X,V  Where  Y,U is the joining itemset of X,V and X  V  c  FP-Growth algorithm FP-growth algorithm is an efficient method of mining all frequent itemsets without candidate generation. FP-growth utilizes a combination of vertical and horizontal database layouts to store the database in main memory. Instead of storing the cover for every  item in the database, it stores the actual transactions from the database in a tree structure and every item has a linked list going through all transactions that contain that item. This new data structure is denoted by FP-tree\(Frequent-Pattern tr ee  Essen tiall y  al l transactions are stored in a tree data structure. Every node additionally stores a counter, which keeps track of the number of transactions that share the branch through that node. In addition, a link is stored, pointing to the next occurrence of the respective item in the FP-tree, such that all occurrences of an item in the FP-tree are linked together Furthermore, a header table is stored containing each separate item together with its support and a link to the first occurrence of the item in the FP-tree. In the FP-tree, all items are ordered in support descending order, as it is hoped that this representation of the database is kept as small as possible since all of the more frequently occurring items are arranged closer to the root of the FP-tree and thus are more likely to be shared III  EXPERIMENT  SETUP  1  The experiment setup is a flow of standard data mining processes proposed by Han & Kamb i gu re 1  shows the experiment steps of this research. It consists of five steps: data collectio n, data preparation, feature selection and preprocessing, mining and experiment results

The experiment steps for this research 2  Data Collection  We are using the Pusat Teknologi Maklumat \(PTM Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia \(UKM\etwork traffic dataset, the captured results contain 3 days of network traffic, starting from July, 13 th 2009 17:30:39 until July, 15th 2009  13:29:59, with 27,918,524 records in 348 files. The data was captured using Wireshark tools  Since the data captured is saved as raw data in binary format, it is not easy to further the process directly. In order to convert the dataset from raw data into plain text data, the Windump tools were employed, allowing the user to intercept and display TCP/IP packets  3  Data Preparation Prior to data preprocessing, the data set will be divided into two dataset categories, normal category and tested category. The normal category dataset is reference data which does not have intrusions, and the tested category contains data, which has intrusions; the normal category dataset has been analyzed using CACE Pilot tools and proved by an expert. In this stage, the dataset is divided by time slot according to when the data was captured. Table 2 shows the specification of normal and tested category data sets The CACE Pilot is a latest commercial visualization charting, reporting, and "drill-down" tool used to analyze networks w o rks  w i t h Wi resh ark  co m p l e m e n t s Wireshark\222s prodigious dissector, and displays filter capabilities. CACE Pilot offers an intuitive and easy-to-use user interface designed to increase  network analysis and troubleshooting effectiveness. Based on the CACE Pilot visualization and charting features, the normal category data set was analyzed and intrusions data was isolated and removed. As an illustration, a port scanning attack isolated by CACE Pilot tool will be described. Using several statistical visualization tools in the CACE Pilot, the data that has one source destination IP address with SYN TCP Flag access to our server IP address for several different port numbers will be considered as a port scanning attack Furthermore, this data should be removed from our normal data T ABLE 2  T HE SPECIFICATION OF NORMAL AND TESTED DATA SETS   4  Feature Selection and Preprocessing Several network features were extracted for the PTM\222s datasets based on our analysis  d ex pert adv i c e  SYN, FIN and RST types of TCP flags, number of source IP addresses, number of destination IP addresses, and the total size of packets were utilized, to perform statistical calculations on the features based on 2, 5 and 10 second windowing and to create and divide datasets into several categories based on time slots The statistical calculation processing results are continuous data; continuous data needs to be converted to categorical data. In order to do that, the maximum-minimum normalization approach is used for Apriori and FP-growth Fuzzy Apriori uses fuzzy set to describe the linguistics for all variables with domains t an dard m e m b ersh ip  function for the fuzzy variable is used [5 0 In th is  experiment, there are three groups of data sets based on different timeslot statistical calculation processes, 2, 5 and 10 second and for each group there is a normal category dataset and four tested categories datasets that are categorized. This signifies that this experiment has 15 different data sets and for each dataset there are three AR algorithms, namely the Appriori, Fuzzy Appriori and FPGrowth which will be performed  5  Mining Process Each dataset is then mining using three association rule algorithms to establish the association rules pattern Anomaly detection is calculated by comparing the rules of normal category dataset with the rules of tested category datasets based on similarity measurements. If the similarity result is higher than the user threshold, it means that the dataset has no intrusions, and vice versa    Category Time slots when data sets are collected 13/07 14/07 15/07 Normal 00:00:00 \226 06:00:00 20:00:01 \226 24:00:00       Tested-1 06:00:01 \226 09:00:00    Tested-2 09:00:01 \226 13:00:00    Tested-3 13:00:01 \226 17:00:00    Tested-4 17:00:01 \226 20:00:00   PTM Network Dataset Data Preparation using on time windowing  Features Selectio n  Discretization and Normalization Mining Evaluate

These rules were acquired by applying association rule techniques for network traffic data called anomaly association rules that were used to determine whether there was an intrusion or not in the data, through a similarity measurement based on user threshol   The results are displayed in Table 3 and Figure 2 for 2second datasets, three approaches in association rules were performed to obtain the similarity measurement between normal category dataset and the four tested datasets Table 3 displays that Fuzzy Appriori obtained results lower than Appriori and FP-Growth for Tested-1 and Tested2, which contains values lower than the predefined user threshold value. Thus, Tested-1 and Tested-2 will be considered as intrusion datasets. Subsequently, for Tested-3 and Tested-4, the Fuzzy Appriori displays results higher than Appriori and FP-Growth. Since the values for Tested-3 and Tested-4 are higher than the predefined user threshold value that dataset is considered to have no intrusion T ABLE 3  R ESULTS FOR 2SECOND WINDOWING DATASETS  Approaches Tested-1 Tested-2 Tested-3 Tested-4 Appriori 0.156 0.421 0.856 0.863 Fuzzy Appriori 0.000 0.366 0.903 0.895 FP-Growth 0.172 0.404 0.853 0.862   Figure 2. Graphical results for 2-second windowing datasets  From three comparison results of 2, 5 and 10-second, the results from Fuzzy Appriori always registered higher values than Appriori and FP-Growth for the non-intrusion dataset and vice versa. Thus, the Fuzzy Appriori approach has the ability to differentiate between intrusion dataset and nonintrusion datasets better than the Appriori and FP-Growth approaches. For furthers analysis, comparison within each of these approaches for three groups of datasets were made. The results are shown in Table 4, Figure 3, Figure 4, and Figure 5 for Appriori, Fuzzy Appriori and FP-Growth approaches respectively  Figure 3.

The result from 2-second datasets offers the lower values than 5-second and 10-second if the values are lower than the predefined user threshold and vice versa. Thus, 2second windowing offers better ability to differentiate between intrusion dataset with non-intrusion datasets. Table 5 and Figure 6 bellow shows the results obtained from experiments in term of computational time

Graphical Comparison results in computational times in seconds  The FP-Growth required less time to process the dataset than Appriori and Fuzzy Appriori for all groups. Appriori required less time than the Fuzzy Appriori. Thus, FP-Growth offers the fastest approach since FP-Growth no need to create candidate generations. Appriori offers a faster approach than Fuzzy Appriori, since the Fuzzy set requires the more complex computation than the Fixed set Figure 7 displays a part of sample of the best model \(rules generated from the 2- second of Tested-1 dataset                   Figure 7.The sample of the best model for anomaly rules  Based on the result above, Table 6 shows which datasets have intrusion.

The experiment was conducted based on UKM network traffic. The experiment has shown which datasets have anomaly,  has produced the anomaly detection patterns \(rules\which can be used to update the signature rules for UKM\222s IDS in order to filter network traffic better. The research has show that the Fuzzy Appriori approach offers the best results. The research also found that pre-processing in a form 2-second has shown the best method  to detect intrusion  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT  This work has been supported by 01-01-02-SF0598  REFERENCES 1  Lakhina, A., Crovella, M. & Diot, C. 2005.

Distribution of the AU in the interpolated box Here each colour represents the class it is assigned to Red6, for instance, represents AUclass7 which corresponds to Au content more than 8.0, which is actually of a great interest to the mining companies. On the top-left corner of the figure is the map from colour to class number7. By using the thresholding technique we have separated AUclass7 and AUclass6 \(see Figure 3 content of AU in the mine Figure 3. Distribution of AUclass6 and AUclass7 only These results show that k-NN classification can be ap6In grey-scale mode red is medium grey 7Please, ignore the number 5.5, this is because the visualisation software needs continues values plied to borehole data for interpolation. Moreover k-NN classification has wider applicability than for instance IDW because we can incorporate not only numerical attributes like coordinates into similarity metrics, but categorical values as well. This is very important, since spatial correlation is not always dominant and apparent in borehole data. Complex geological processes can produce very complex structures in the ground. But statistical methods like IDW rely only on coordinate values. For instance, if one wants to interpolate not only metal grades but also rock type distribution, then IDW cannot be used, because it works with numerical values only, but rock types have categorical values such as type2 type11 and etc. However, k-NN classification still can be applied for rock types as it can classify rock type of a new point with the majority rock type from the k-nearneighbours. In Figure 4 we show an example of k-NN classification applied to the rock types Figure 4. Rock type distribution in the mine Here again each colour represents different rock type. The image stretched into direction of the Y axis for more realistic view. We have used class label 99 for representing the points that are too far8 from known points. Interpolating such points does not make sense, because not enough information is available about their surrounding area. In Figure 4 we hide all points that have class label 99.

VII. ASSOCIATION RULES Association rules mining is one of the widely used tools in data mining. The most common algorithm for fining association rules is the Apriori algorithm [17] which finds frequent itemsets from a transaction dataset and derives association rules. The frequent itemset is an itemset such that its frequency is larger than the user specified parameter 8If the distance between unknown and closest known points is greater than some specified value we do not compute interpolation 116 called support. The confidence parameter is also can be set by the user, for generating association rules that have confidence larger than the specified value One can find complete description of Apriori algorithm in the data mining literature [11], [17], [18]. In the boreholes data, association rules can be used for finding associations of metals with or without considering rock types. We can find rules such as if Ni=Niclass1 and RID=Type11 then Cu=CUclass1 with 0.99 confidence9. When finding association rules one has to make sure that rules make sense Domain experts can interpret and refine the discovered rules Keep in mind that data mining is not always only finding something we already know, but discovering previously unknown relations and patterns After applying the Apriori algorithm to our borehole data we identified the rules/relationships known to the domain experts. But we have also found some new rules which were unknown and were very interesting to our domain experts As this is not a geology paper we will not focus of particular aspects of those rules. What we are interested in is how we can use association rules to correct some errors from k-NN classification or in general \(say for IDW interpolation results. Some of the rules we found were 1 with conf:\(1 2 CU=CUclass1 with conf:\(0.99 3 0.97 4 0.95 We do not include all the rules because they will not contribute more to understanding the work. Our goal here is to show that association rules mining can be applied to 


borehole data and we give framework how to do it, by bringing the data into useful form and most importantly how these rules help us improve interpolation results. This is discussed in Section IX VIII. CROSS-VALIDATION RESULTS In this section we present a comparison of the IDW method and k-NN classification while interpolating the borehole data. For this we performed cross-validation of the methods. Namely, from borehole data that are known extracted during drilling process records10 and remove information about grades or class labels of the metals. We then try to recover the information that was deleted by using both IDW or k-NN classification methods. We repeat this procedure ten times and compute average accuracy for recovery by each method. Note that the randomly selected records were removed from known data 9Confidence has the value from 0 to 1, the bigger the value the more confidence we have in the rule 10We have tried to select various numbers of records and obtained similar results so during the nearest-neighbours computations the same records are not included in the list of nearest-neighbours Checking with different metrics sometimes helps to identify proper distance functions to use. We have tried Euclidean distance and Chebyshev distance functions. The Chebyshev distance or L? metric between two vectors is the maximum of their differences along any coordinate dimension. Thus for any vectors p = \(p1, p2,    , pn q = \(q1, q2,    , qn dist\(p, q i pi ? qi The choice of the distance function depends on data as well as the number of attributes \(in this case n involved in the computation. If n is large \(some researchers say 6 is already too large is recommended. In our case, we are only using spatial coordinates so it does not matter which distance function we use. This was confirmed by our experiments. We present results for k-NN classification using Chebyshev distance see Table III Test run 3-nn 5-nn 10-nn 20-nn IDW

This can be explained by the fact that in order to add more neighbours you must go further from your interpolation point. The further you go from your interpolation point, the less influence they should have However, k-NN does not weight them according to their distance As one can see in Table III, classification computed by 5NN gives us almost the same accuracy as IDW, but as we go to 3-NN we obtain better accuracy than IDW. These results are very promising. Taking into account not only accuracy but the fact the k-NN classification has the potential of involving more attributes from data into the interpolation task as it works not only with numerical values, but can involve categorical values as well IX. CORRECTION BY USING RULES In this section we discuss possibility of improving interpolation results by using rules discovered during associations 117 rules mining. In Section VII we presented some of the rules we obtained. As we have mentioned in Section VII, the rules that we have presented there are not all. These rules are chosen from the list as examples to be used here for error correction of the interpolation applied to nickels \(Ni grades. Therefore all our results are concentrated on nickel We will not list all possible corrections, but will give examples for both k-NN classification and IDW methods 


Because in the cross-validation phase we randomly select some records from known data, we have correct class labels for each record that has been chosen. Thus, we can actually check whether our interpolation produced wrong result or not In one of the test runs in the k-NN classification method we have an error in the classification of Ni. One of the randomly chosen records was wrongly classified as NiClass1 instead of NiClass211. We checked other metals class labels for this point and noticed that AU has a class label AUclass4 But one can see from the association rules, particularly rule 3 \(see Section VII then with 0.97 confidence we should have Niclass2. Thus wrongly classified record can be corrected by this rule to be Niclass2 instead of Niclass1 Now, the same idea can be applied to the IDW method as well. Here again, interpolation for Ni produced a wrong result. The correct class label for the point was Niclass2, but was classified as Niclass1. Checking the AU class label for this point we noticed that it has AUclass3 label, but from association rules in Section VII, rule 4 says that if AU has a class label AUclass3, then with 0.95 confidence we should have Niclass2. So, we can correct this error as well Obviously, not all the errors can be corrected solely by association rules, but the important message is that extra analysis of the data can help us obtain better results of interpolation by each method. It is important to mention here, that this process can be automated up to a certain degree for interpolation methods to become more intelligent by taking into account more knowledge about the data. Also one should not underestimate the role of geology in the specific area of mine. This knowledge is also very important and can improve the results as well X. MATHEMATICAL MORPHOLOGY OPERATIONS Although for mining companies accurate interpolation is highly desirable, usually they are more concerned about large areas of rock types rather than small structures here and there. Thus methods which can accurately filter the results are also very useful. Having results filtered not only improves visual understanding of the mine structure, but also can be used for faster ore grades computations with techniques such as kriging, IDW or k-NN. For such a task we 


11This can happen because of very complex structure of the rock types and geology. The ways in which this occurs are beyound the scope of this paper propose using mathematical morphology operations. In this section we introduce some basic operations of mathematical morphology \(MM k-NN interpolation Mathematical morphology is a technique most frequently used in image processing, but it can be applied for analysing geometrical structures in general [19]. There are four basic operations of mathematical morphology: erosion, dilation opening and closing. These operations are usually defined on binary images. However in our case because we apply them for one rock type at the time, we can safely assume that we are dealing with binary images12. Let E be a Euclidean space or an integer grid, and A a binary image in E Erosion: The erosion of the binary image A by the structuring element B is defined by AB = {p ? E|Bp ? A where Bp is the translation of B by vector p or formally Bp = {b+ p|b ? B}, ?p ? E Dilation: The dilation of A by the structuring element B is defined by A?B  b?B Ab Opening: The opening of A by B is obtained by the erosion of A by B, followed by dilation of the resulting image by B A ?B = \(AB Closing: The closing of A by B is obtained by the dilation of A by B, followed by erosion of the resulting structure by B A B = \(A?B Intuitively, erosion removes all objects that are smaller than structuring element and makes larger objects smaller by reducing the boundary by the size of structuring element Conversely, dilation increases the boundary of all objects either small or large, by the size of the structuring element Dilation also closes any holes in the objects that are smaller than the structuring element. We are not presenting any more 


details about these operations as they are extensively covered in literature as well as on the web. We have to mention though, that in our example we are dealing with 3D structure not with the image. We use sphere centred on the origin as a structuring element. Because we have regular grid \(see Section III its six neighbours \(top, bottom, left, right, front and back 12For instance, say we use MM for rock type 6, then we can assume that in points where we have rock type 6, we have one and zero otherwise 118 XI. MATHEMATICAL MORPHOLOGY IN ACTION Let us now see how mathematical morphology operations can filter the results of interpolation as discussed in Section X. As an example we have chosen rock type 6, as we think here we can more clearly demonstrate the method Note, that if after interpolation we get more or less solid chunk of some rock type, then the effect of morphology would be minimal and will not be considered as a good demonstration example Figure 5. Distribution of the rock type 6 in the original boreholes data In Figure 5 one can see the distribution of the rock type 6 in the raw borehole data \(known points grid and interpolating with k-NN classification method \(see Section VI Figure 6. Distribution of the rock type 6 in the grid after interpolation Figure 6 shows that there are many small objects that need to be filtered. Usually, in image analysis this will be considered as a noise. Morphological opening has a small noise reduction effect. In order to understand this fully let us explain what this operation will do to our structure From Section X we know that opening is defined by erosion followed by dilation. In our case, the erosion in 3D, with spherical structuring element, will remove all points that together with their six neighbours do not have the value 6 At this stage all small \(relative to the structuring element objects will be deleted. It will shrink the boundaries of the objects which remain, but this effect will be reversed when the dilation operation is applied. The results of morphological opening can be seen in Figure 7 Figure 7. Distribution of the rock type 6 in the grid after interpolation We have now much clearer objects. It is worthwhile to mention that this process can be fully automated and mining 


experts can start their ore deposits estimations with much clearer data which is easier to deal with XII. CONCLUSION We have presented how data mining can be applied to the borehole data coming from active mine area. We are certain that data mining has a huge potential for other types of borehole data. One of the important steps in data mining is the preparation of data into useful form for various algorithms. Together with domain experts we have identified a way for transforming data to a form acceptable to k-NN classification and association rules mining algorithms Although we have shown how the k-NN classification and association rules mining techniques can be applied here this framework will open new possibilities to perform other data mining tasks to this type of data. Our experimental results are very promising in this regard as they show that we are not only able to match the accuracy of the results with IDW method used in the mining industry, but also exceed it \(93.1% accuracy was obtained by 3-NN method while IDW gave 88.5% accuracy rules as a separate analysis tool can improve not only k-NN classification results but also IDW interpolation results. This is particularly important for convincing mining companies 119 of the benefits of data mining, as with a little effort they can improve the method they are already using As we have shown in this paper, not only choosing right classification techniques can help us to improve interpolation, but more general analysis on data like association rules can contribute a lot. Thus, the more knowledge we have on the hidden relationships and patterns the more accurately you can construct an interpolation. Moreover, discovering hidden correlations not only important for this task, but also can contribute to understanding about complex geological processes that this specific area undergone. Therefore data mining, which can discover useful knowledge purely from data is of great importance and will be area of research for next generation of exploration and mining specialists Finally, we have proposed to use mathematical morphology for filtering the results of rock type interpolation. In the example given here, we have seen that it performed well in removing relatively small objects and filtering out large 


areas of interest from rock types XIII. FUTURE WORK This paper provides a framework for using data mining techniques on the borehole data. Using this framework we would like to investigate possibilities of using other classification techniques on this type of data. We mentioned that borehole data can contain more information about the area besides spatial coordinates, rock types and metal grades so classification that utilizes this extra information will be on our immediate research agenda Application of mathematical morphology provides possibilities for further research on domaining \(filtering out large areas of interest be given also to this ACKNOWLEDGEMENT I want to thank the Director of the WH Bryan Mining and Geology Research Centre, at the University of Queensland Professor Alan Bye and his PhD student Mr Younes Fadakar Alghalandis for contributing their expertise to this research This work is supported by the AuScope National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy by the Australian Commonwealth, the Queensland State Government and The University of Queensland REFERENCES 1] A.
