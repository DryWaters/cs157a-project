Intelligent User Search Behav iour Knowledge Discovery Yun Shen and Trevor Martin Member IEEE Abstract  It is important for Web search engine providers to study user behaviour in order to have a better understanding of how customers interact with search engines so that they can improve users overall search experience However user behaviour in a search engine is complicated and affected by various factors e.g query length intention/context/time when queries are submitted etc It is interesting to nd answers to questions such as whether loyal users are more likely to issue short length queries or medium length queries If so is that behaviour linked with high click through rate or is it linked with the userís previous search experience In this paper we argue that user behaviour should be better analysed from a subjective angle and introduce a granular analysis algorithm to intelligently extract user behaviour knowledge in a humancentric way to answer above questions We study six variables relating to user behaviour study and demonstrate how fuzzy association rules mining based on mass assignment theory can intelligently analyse user activity patterns in a large scale Web search log data set I I NTRODUCTION The success of a search engine relies on the number of its customers It is thus important for search engine providers to have a better understanding of how the customers interact with the search engine so that they can improve users overall search experience conseque ntly growing their customer populations Web search log at the service provider side records how users interact with the search engine by retaining information about user queries time stamp IP addresses web browser types devices etc Naturally such log le is the most important source to directly study and understand user search behaviour There are two major research directions on analysing user search behaviour one is modelling user behaviour collectively with the assumption that users who had similar behaviour in the past are likely to have similar behaviour in the future another research direction focuses on modelling individual search behaviour or grouping queries/session according to certain criteria We focus on collective user behaviour in this paper Most of previous research on user behaviour analysis proposed statistical methods to conduct studies on user behaviour

with a user when submitting queries previous experience with the search engine whether ranking of the results matching userís expectation etc When analysing user behaviour it is desirable to use linguistic labels to describe above various factors in order to conduct a more meaningful study to answer questions such as whether loyal users are more likely to issue short length queries or medium length queries if so is that behaviour linked with high click through rate or is it linked with the userís previous search experience in a more human understandable way Fuzzy set theory particularly Zadehís paradigm of computing with words 10 w a s e s p eci al l y developed for the task of representing human linguistic concepts in terms of a mathematical object a fuzzy subset However it is interesting to note that we found few fuzzy research focusing on user behaviour understanding Most of the research efforts aim at web log usage mining 11 12   various fuzzy methods such as fuzzy

method is 19  w hi ch propos ed t o us e f uzzy as s o ci at i o n rules to mine sequential user navigation patterns in Web log However the method is complex and can not be applied to collective user behaviour study In this paper we propose six variables relating to user search behaviour and demonstrate how mass assignment theory based fuzzy association rules mining can intelligently analyse user activity in a large scale Web search log data set The rest of the paper is organised as follows In Section II we discuss the need of subjective analysis to understand user behaviour and theoretical foundation of fuzzy association rules mining In Section III we demonstrate how to intelligently extract knowledge from a large scale web search log using the proposed granular association algorithm Finally in Section IV we conclude the paper and propose several interesting research directions in the future II G RANULE A SSOCIATION A NALYSIS Association rule mining 20 w as  r s t propos ed t o mi ne rules from transaction databases The aim of association rule mining is to determine whether or not there are links between two disjoint subsets of items for example do customers generally buy biscuits and ch eese when beer lager and wine are bought Formally let I   i 1 i 2   i n  be a set of items and T   t 1 t 2   t m  be a set of transactions Notice that any transaction can be represented as t i I Let x and y be 978-1-4244-8126-2/10/$26.00 ©2010 IEEE 


two non-overlapping subsets of I  X and Y be two sets of transactions containing items x and y respectively The goal of association analysis is to sear ch for interesting association or correlation relationships between X and Y  That is if the items in x appear in a transaction it is likely that the items in y will also appear i.e it is not an implication in the formal logical sense There are two useful measures for the association analysis support and condence The support of a rule is the fraction of transactions in which both X and Y appear and the condence of a rule is an estimate based on the samples of the conditional probability of Y given X  The mathematical denitions are given below Supp  X  Y  X  Y T  1 Conf  X  Y  X  Y X  2 Typically association rule mining algorithms discover all item associations or rules in the data that satisfy the userspecied minimum support minsup and minimum conﬁdence minconf constraints Minsup controls the minimum number of data cases that a rule must cover Minconf controls the predictive strength of the rule A association rule is correct if it satises these two parameters Fuzzy association analysis has been intensively studied in recent years 21 22    23  18   T he s t andard e x tens ion to the fuzzy case is to treat the multi sets X  Y as fuzzy and nd the intersection and cardinality using a t norm and sigma-count respectively The condence Equation 2 is transformed into Conf  X  Y   i I  XY  i   i I  X  i  3 where  refers to the monadic fuzzy membership function Using min and the sigma count for cardinality can be unsatisfactory 22 b ecaus e it does not distinguish between several tuples with low memberships and few tuples with high memberships In the granule setting we allow partial membership For example instead of looking for an association between potato crisps and beer  we might look for an association between snack foods and alcoholic drinks  It is important to note that we are dealing with conjunctive fuzzy sets monadic fuzzy relations here Mass assignment theory is normally applied to fuzzy sets representing possibility distributions and the operation of nding the conditional probability of one fuzzy set given another is known as semantic unication 24  T hi s r es t s on t h e underl yi ng as s u mpt i o n o f a s i ngl e valued attribute A different approach is required to nd the conditional probability when we are dealing with set-valued attributes In the rest of the section we briey discuss mass assignment based fuzzy associ ation rule mining algorithm Detailed theoretical study can be found at 25  A Granule Association Analysis Mass-based Approach When working with large datasets a natural approach is to group similar items/transactions into categories or sets and summarise the data in term of such categories which is a key feature of human intelligence to discover knowledge Granules provide a convenie nt way to describe a nite set of objects by specifying certain selection criteria Once the granules are constructed one may be interested in developing computational methods to study the relationships among these granules The core of information granulation 26 i s t hat i nformation can be processed on different levels of abstraction in which data objects are organised into meaningful granules 1 so as to convey a perception of information itself Thus it is necessary to study the criteria for deciding how a clump of points objects are d rawn together by indistinguishability similarity proximity or functionality 2 In th is p a p e r  we assume that the entities instances that are being categorised are known unambiguously We consider two granules represented as monadic fuzzy relations X and Y on the same domain and wish to calculate the degree of associa tion between them For example consider a search transaction database of Web search engine containing activity time and number of queries gures We can categorise transactions according to whether their activity time are long  medium or short and also according to whether their click through rate gures are high  moderate or low  A mining task might be nding out whether the high click through rate gures are associated with long activity time GivenTableI TABLE I A CTIVITY T IME V  S C LICK T HROUGH R AT E ID Activity Time\(s Click Through Rate a 4,000 10 b 3,200 4 c 2,000 8 d 800 7 suppose we have source granule as long activity time  X  and target granule as high click through rate  Y  by dening the monadic fuzzy relations X  a 1 b 0  8 c 0  5 d 0  2 and Y  a 1 b 0  4 c 0  8 d 0  7 It is important to note that these represent sets of values that all satisfy the related granule to a degree Unless explicitly mentioned all the sets in the rest of the section shall be interpreted as conjunctive relations The condence in an association rule in such setting can be calculated as follows 1 A fuzzy subset of the uni verse corresponds to a granule in this paper 


Without loss of generality w e explain the operations on the source granule For a source granule we have X  x 1  X  x 1  x 2  X  x 2    x X   X  x X   we can dene the corresponding mass assignment 24 for the source granule as follows Let the set of distinct memberships in X be   1 X  2 X     n X  X  where  1 X  2 X      n X  X and n X X  Let X 1    x   X  x   1 X   and X i    x   X  x     i  X    1 i  n X then the mass assignment corresponding to X is X i  m X  X i    1  i  n X where m X  X k    k  X    k 1 X    i  X 0 if i  n X  For example given source granule X  a 1 b 0  8 c 0  5 d 0  2 it has the corresponding mass assignment M X    a 0  2   a b  0  3   a b c  0  3   a b c d  0  2  We can now calculate the condence in the association between the granules X and Y using mass assignment theory In general this will be an in terval as we are free to move mass consistently between elements of each X i and Y j  For two mass assignments M X  X i  m X  X i    1  i  n X and M Y  Y j  m Y  Y i    1  j  n Y the composite mass assignment is M C  M X  M Y   S  m C  S   where m C is the composite mass allocation function subject to n Y  j 1 M C  ij  m X  X i  n X  i 1 M C  ij  m Y  Y i  We can get Conf  X  Y  n X  i 1 n Y  j 1 M C  ij  X i Y j  n X  i 1 n Y  j 1 M C  ij  X i  4 We can calculate the condence in the Table II This enables us to calculate a ssociation condences with O  cn  complexity rather than O n 4 here c is a constant and n is the number of focal elements in the source granule X  For the given example we get the condence value 0.744 through Table II Minimum and maximum condence are not considered in this paper Further details can be found at 25  T he t h eoret i cal compari s on s t udy bet w een t h e p ropos ed association algorithm and other methods can be found at 27  TABLE II M ASS T ABLE  2 a,c 1 a,c,d  0  3 a,c,d,b  0  4  2 a a a a a,b 3 a a a ab a,b,c  0  3 a ac ac abc a,b,c,d  0  2 a ac acd abcd Conf  S T 0  2  0  2+0  1+0  3+0  4  1 0  3  0  2+0  1+0  3  1+0  3  0  4  2 0  3  0  2  1+0  3  0  1+0  3  2 0  3  0  4  3 0  2  0  2  1+0  2  0  1  2 0  2  0  3  3+0  2  0  4  4  2  5 0  744 III E XPERIMENTS We divide our experiments into two parts The rst part is conducted on part of a Web search click data set with 65,516 unique users and 3,558,412 lines of web search log from a commercial search engine This part of the experiments shows the potentials of the proposed fuzzy association rules mining algorithm in intelligent user behaviour proling The second part is conducted on the Web search click data set with 197,476 unique users and 10,853,833 lines of web search log from the same commercial search engine This part of the experiments studies whether enlarged number of unique users affects the results of user behaviour we discovered It also demonstrates the scalability of the proposed method to process large scale data sets A Variables Relating to User Behaviour The data set contains three months Web search click data collected from a commercial web search engine in 2006 To safeguard user privacy all user identiable data were anonymised and are further encrypted when analysing data The data set has ve elds Anonymous ID Query String Query Time Item Rank and Clicked URL They are summarised in the Table III In this section we propose and

users and 10,853,833 lines of search transactions This dat a set contains all the data we used in the Section III-B We study whether enlarged number of unique users affects the results of user behaviour proling stated in previous section It also demonstrates the scalability of the proposed method to process large scale data sets We re-use all the fuzzy membership functions dened in the previous section The results are shown in Table IV It is safe to conclude that enlarged number of unique users does not affect the results of user behaviour in Section III-B which is strong evidence that the proposed method can be used to predict peopleís behaviour due to the stability of the results To study the scalability we compare the actual time of computing V and the results are shown in Table VI The experiments are carried out on a Macbook 2.0GHZ with 4GB memory running Mac OS X 10.5.8 and Java 1.6.0 13 As the number of users in the second part of the experiment is increased by 3 times it is noti ceable that the actual computing time increases by around 10 times while theoretically it should be around 3 c times where c is a constant factor as mentioned in Section II-A This would give c a value of 3.5 It is reasonable to conclude that the complexity of our fuzzy association algorithm is O\(3.5n in practice IV C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE W ORK In this paper we propose to use mass assignment based fuzzy association rule mining algorithm to personalise analysis of user behaviour from web search log for search engine providers We demonstrate that the proposed method can automatically discover user behaviour knowledge and is scalable to process large scale dataset In our future work we will conduct more studies on several directions affecting user search behaviour in the search engine such as visual layout of returned results semantic intention of user queries psychological impact of failed queries It would be desirable to assess the proposed method in different web search logs and comparativ ely study the possible user behaviour variability in different search engines R EFERENCES  E  A gichtein E  B rill and S  D um ais Improving web search ranking by
