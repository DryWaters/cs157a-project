Abstract 
tion of services for tting personalization requirements from end users expectations of powerful computing and storage capabilities of handhold devices and so on Therefore a supporting infrastructure that can handle big data arisen from large number of devices and can exibly switch services at run time is needed Henceforth in this paper we propose an OSGi based pervasive cloud OSGi-PC infrastructure which can make use both of the cloud computing capabilities and component exibilities from OSGi We 
have evaluated the OSGi-PC in terms of performance and power consumption to show its usability 
There is a growing trend for the convergence of different computing paradigms such as cloud computing pervasive and mobile computing service oriented computing due to the needs of global availability and sharing of information The applications of large Internet of Things IoT Internet of Services IoS Internet of People IoP are gaining increasing attention We are confronted with increas 
1 Introduction 
ing complexities in the converged computing world These complexities mainly come from the scale of an application becomes unprecedented large the management of an application is much more difìcult due to large number of involved devices events and contexts due to the heterogeneity of networking hardware and software and so on Very often pervasive devices limited in their processing power and storing capability which in turn requires collaborations/interactions with more powerful nodes from the 
supporting computing infrastructure In the convergence of different computing paradigms there arises a computing paradigm called mobile cloud computing MCC The central idea of mobile cloud computing is to use backend powerful computing nodes from traditional cloud services to enhance capabilities of small devices There are a number of MCC solutions proposed so far such as Misco and Hyrax 12 But none of these proposed solutions focus on providing a component based solutions following a component standard and 
therefore lack capabilities of exible management of services and components especially when services come and go between different nodes Considering all these challenges and existing solutions in this paper we propose an OSGi based pervasive cloud OSGi-PC solution which can be deployed to different IAASs OSGi-PC can make use of the component and service management capabilities from OSGi such as dynamic install/uninstall components and services dynamic updates to components and services We have done some prelimi 
nary evaluations of the OSGi-PC in terms of its performance and latency and shows the usability of it The rest of the paper is structured as follows We show an overview of the OSGi-PC in Section 2 Section 3 discusses the prototype implementation of the OSGi-PC We evaluated the prototype OSGi-PC in Section 4 Related work is described in 5 Conclusions and future work end the paper

2.1 Brief introduction to OSGi and ROSGi 2.2 overview of OSGi-PC 
OSGi Open Service Gateway Initiative 1 is a defacto standard Java module and service platform that implements a complete and dynamic component model Its components called bundles can be remotely installed started stopped updated and uninstalled without requiring a reboot which is advantageous for dynamic environment The OSGi service registry allows bundles to detect the joining and leaving and facilitates adaptation accordingly In order to access services remotely from another OSGi service registry in a transparent manner R-OSGi\(Remote Services for OSGi 2 was proposed which runs as an OSGi bundle and facilitates distribution for arbitrary OSGi framework implementations A service provider framework only needs to register a service for remote access For every remote service a local proxy bundle is generated that registers the same service Local service clients can then access the remote services in the same way as local services The general idea behind OSGi-PC is to promote a standard way of building managing services between different nodes in a pervasive cloud environment In this environment different OSGi service frameworks can be dynamically added or removed and services can be dynamically deployed and undeployed following the OSGi standard as speciìed by the Remote Services in the OSGi compendium speciìcation in chapter 122 3  The OSGi-PC infrastructure is constituted by many distributed OSGi based frameworks which can be considered as two elements namely client OSGi cloud service on small devices and server OSGi services on powerful cloud nodes All these OSGi services should follow the same OSGi standard in order to interoperate with each other to support dynamic deployment and replacement of OSGi services and to scale well when new services are added To support the dynamics of the OSGi-PC there is a service discovery component dynamically discover what OSGi frameworks join the cloud ecosystem and what OSGi framework is dropped and removed from the system An overview of the OSGi-PC is shown in Figure 1 Under the coordination of the discovery component remote cloud service frameworks and local client service frameworks can be accessed indiscriminately 1 http://www.osgi.org 2 http://r-osgi.sourceforge.net/index.html 3 http://www.osgi.org/Download/File?url=/download/r4v43/osgi.cmpn4.3.0.pdf The OSGi-PC works following the Broker architectural pattern When an OSGi Frame w ork Frame w ork1 started it will set up a communication channel with the speciìed remote Discovery Component If this is successful then this OSGi framework will register itself to the discovery component with necessary information Framework1 will also nd other frameworks registered to the Discovery Component At the same time Framework1 will nd provided services from those registered frameworks generate local stubs of these remote services and register these services with local OSGi service registry in Framework1 The process is shown in Figure 2 In this way the accessing of remote services is more or less identical to the access of local services in the local OSGi Framework When an OSGi Framework is forced to close because of abnormal situations or network reasons the Discovery Component can automatically remove it from the registry To implement the OSGi-PC infrastructure we choose Apache Felix OSGi framework 4 for the cloud OSGi services because Felix is following OSGi standard to the best from our former experiences on EU LinkSmart project   F or small de vices we are using R-OSGi 14 to achieve distributed OSGi integration in order to realize a dynamic cloud service infrastructure R-OSGi is suitable for lightweight distributed communication among OSGi components in different Java Virtual Machines JVMs Considering the requirements on the management of OSGi frameworks distributed among different nodes the speciìc implementation class diagram of OSGi-PC core 4 http://felix.apache.org

Figure 2 Overview of the OSGi-PC Figure 3 Core classes of the OSGi-PC Figure 4 remote OSGi cloud framework of the OSGi-PC 
classes are shown in Figure 3 The OSGiFramework interface deìnes some variables related to an OSGi framework and services in the framework mostly status variables such as TEMPORARY_UNAVAILABLE QUOTA_EXCEEDED and so on The Factory method design pattern is used to instantiate an OSGi frame w ork instance in order to improve exibility for instantiation ServiceProvisioner is designed to realize the dynamic deployment of services and OSGi frameworks When it detects new instances of OSGi frameworks it will check whether it is needed to deploy new services to the new coming framework and if so it will then conduct the deployment of bundles and services The remote OSGi cloud framework is composed of multiple OSGi frameworks running remotely and coordinated by the discovery component as show in Figure 4 As the discovery component is critical for the functioning of the OSGi-PC it is running in a master-slave hot back up mode Whenever something wrong with the primary discovery component the back up component can assume duty immediately In our implementation we reuse code from Distributed OSGi DOSGi 5  who is using ZooKeeper 6 as the discovery component and hence ZooKeeper is used also by the 5 http://cxf.apache.org/distributed-osgi.html 6 http://zookeeper.apache.org

OSGi-PC For such a discovery mechanism as speciìed by DOSGi standard meta-data information of OSGi components and services are used to disclose service information These meta-data are also available to remote ZooKeeper Server discovery component therefore they can be accessed in a standard way by any OSGi frameworks Figure 5 describes a module named Distribution Provider as in DOSGi that makes OSGi services available across container boundaries i.e different OSGi frameworks It use special service properties to mark services that are to be exported remotely following the same meta-data style as in standard OSGi components The Distribution provider will create Endpoints for these services that are available outside the container On the consumer side the Distribution Provider can create local OSGi services that act as proxies for the remote services and allow service consumers to use them to call the remote service as in the Broker architecture pattern As we said in Section 2 in order to instantiate an OSGi framework managed by the discovery component it needs to implement OSGiFramework interface and then register the framework in the discovery component for example this.registry=context.registerService\(OSGiFramework.class getName fwkImpl properties where is the actual OSGi framework instance with deìne its status and settings After the registration ServiceTracker or Declarative Services can then be used to manage services as in standard OSGi environment as shown in the following code list Due to the popularity of Android devices we choose Android as our starting point to run OSGi on small devices R-OSGi is an attempt to resolv e the limitation of running services across different OSGi frameworks as a lightweight and efìcient communication mechanism between distributed OSGi frameworks The principle behind R-OSGi is shown in Figure 6 First services register themselves to an OSGi container through the R-OSGi framework then R-OSGi will open a service port by default it is 9278 for listening to socket connections The client bundle starts to create a socket connection to a speciìc server with designated port and create a proxy bundle for a remote service This proxy bundle has the same signature as the remote service and is registered to the local OSGi container Therefore the invocation of remote services is the same as local services This hides the complexities of underlying network connections but what is more important is that this makes the accessing and management of OSGi services in OSGi-PC handled in a uniìed and consistent way and it does not matter a service is local or remote In our implementation we choose Felix as the R-OSGi container as Felix can run on Android 7  But R-OSGi can not run directly on Android as R-OSGi clients will generate proxies for remote services at run time 8  and the proxies are normal Java byte code instead of the Dalvik virtual machine readable byte code At rst R-OSGi uses the ASM library 9 for bytecode parsing and creating proxy objects So in order to R-OSGienable an Android client we need to translate ASM to Android and add a method to convert the created proxy object from Java to Dalvik byte code As the proxy object created by ASM is in Java bytecode an OSGi dexiìcation service is needed to transform a class in Java format to Dalvik format The dex.jar contained in the Android SDK can be used with a minor modiìcation by adding a dexiìcation class to cre7 http://felix.apache.org/site/apache-felix-framework-and-googleandroid.html 8 http://linkality.org/software/remote-osgi-android 9 http://asm.ow2.org

ate DexService The last step is to integrate the DexService into the R-OSGi client creation process For this purpose we need to patch R-OSGi so it invokes our DexService after the client proxy class has been created by ASM as outlined by the following code For the initial evaluation of OSGi-PC we developed a simple cloud based diary application which supports the uploading diaries to the backend cloud nodes downloading from backend cloud nodes editing and deleting a diary We mainly tested the latency performance for the listed diary actions  and also power consumption while conducting these diary actions For the measurement of power consumption we show that for LCD screen and CPU and PowerTutor 10 is used for this measurement The measurement of power consumption is on Hisense HS-U950 Currently the backend deployment of OSGi-PC is on Openshift 11 We show the time taken for conducting the listed diary actions in Table 1 From this table we can see that the average power consumption mainly CPU plus LCD screen while using the diary application deployed on OSGi-PC is around 4J which is quite OK For the time taken to upload a simple diary it takes around 1 second which is acceptable For the downloading of a diary it takes around 3 seconds much slower than the uploading This is consistent with our experience of using Openshift it is much faster for uploading e.g Git push than downloading e.g Git clone 12  But this is just our superfacial experiences and we need to investigate more on this issue to see why it is such a case The usage of OSGi-PC supports seamlessly switching of service providing OSGi framework at run time without the need of human intervention We have tested the performance of stoping one OSGi framework and switching the diary management service to another framework at run 10 http://ziyang.eecs.umich.edu/projects/powertutor 11 https://www.openshift.com 12 Git is a software conìguration management tool see http://gitscm.com
