Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Mache Learning and Cybernetics, Xi\222an 2-5 November 2003 THE RESEARCH THAT MININGASSOCIATION RULES ARE BASED ON FEQCL REDUCED BY UNCERTAINTY COEFFICIENT APPROACH YU-BA0 MA, XUE-GANG HU HA0 WANG School of Computer and Information Hefei University of Technology Hefei 230009 Email Xueghu@mail.hf.ah.cn,hfmyb999@sohu.com Abstract It is reduced attribute landscape orientation 
by uncertainty coefficient Frequent Equivalent Quantified Concept Lattice QCL constructed is an efficient tool which represents form of knowledge and data which introduces frequent equivalent quantified base of the concept lattice Association rule implicated among values of attributes of a database can be mined accurately according to the user\222s interesting and strong relativity attributes rather than Apriori algorithm to compute frequent item set then reduces lots of redundant 
association rules and improves the accuracy and efficiency of rules mining Keywords Rule Data Mining Concept Quantified Lattice Association 1 Introduction Mining association rule 221I is one of main content of data mining research at present and emphasizes particularly on finding the relation of differ items in the database There are many attributes of feeble pertinence owing to practice database so that mining association rule may exist many redundancies and errors or may not exist any relation On the other hand 
mining\222s rules may assemble explosion It can effectively resolve these problems that using uncertainty coefficient way reduces the attribute of feeble pertinence Uncertainty coefficient way is that user select pertinence so that it can eliminate feeble pertinence\222s attribute in resolving problem so we can reach intention of predigesting explain Concept Lattice It also stands for Galois Lattice is that R Wille firstly introduced in 1982r51 can open out all kinds of relation what contain in the data In applying practically whereas concept Lattice exists deficiency 
XueGang Hu enlarged Galois Lattice in the paper 2331 and researched and applied Galois Lattice what also contains in Quantified Concept Lattice \(QCL\QCL reduces the form of the expression, accordingly imports the idea of frequent equivalent and quantified extension so that FEQLC is the same with the problem which we discover knowledge in the large database The paper will introduce to eliminate feeble pertinence attribute and construct FEQCL so that we can efficiently mine association rule 2 Association Rules Description Supposed that I=[il,i2,i3   is set of n dissimilitude items, Transaction can express 
 TID XI x2 x3...xm TID is transaction\222 mark in set which is oniy in set  and D is transaction\222s database in which every transaction T is set of many items. Association rule is also the logic formula of XsY therein XET YET and XnY=0 If there were contained XuY into S Association rule\222s supporting degree can definite as Support X*Y XuY in the transaction\222s database; if there were contained Y into X\222s transaction in 
transaction\222s database at the same time X3Y association rule\222s confidence can definite Confidence XsY In order to effectually mine association rule we must give minimal support and minimal confidence Mining association rule is via seeking rules which contain all of support and confidence what partly exceed minimal support and minimal confidence  namely appeal to satisfy Support\(X3Y zminsupport Confidence\(X3Y 2minconfidence rules are the form of X-Y so that seeking rule can decompose of two child problem   1 1 One problem is to find out all 
of frequency item\222s sets from transaction database D 2  the other problem is to create association rules which can not be under the minimal confidence using frequency item\222s sets XuY X 3 Uncertainty Coefficient approach Uncertainty coefficient what was cited in the C4.5[\222 uses to measure how degree supporting attribute affect analysis attribute. Uncertainty coefficient way is a sort of 0-7803-7865-2/03/$17.00 02003 IEEE 256

Table has two attributes can call the two dimensions cross table as analogy there is three dimensions cross table and so no According to criterion by the figure 1 if Y is analysis attribute and X is the supporting attribute we can definite the uncertainty coefficient, as following J at this location hy  zp log p I Uncertainty coefficient is a sort of standardization measurement which the bigger value is the stronger pertinence is when Uyx O,it can denote no correlation between supporting attribute and analysis attribute Moreover when UYx  1,it can denote the strongest correlation between supporting attribute and analysis attribute 4 Frequent Equivalent Quantified Concept Lattice FEQCL Definition4.1 the one conception C A,B BI  Bk is context O,D,R and is the concept of ECL given Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics Wan 2-5 November 2003 257 C\222=\(IAI,B mean C\222s quantified concept C will be named as C\222 real concept therein A is the cardinal number of extension A namely concept\222s extension is quantified  which predigest concept intension Definition4.2 Supported that C=\(A,B AI is a concept in the EQCL if there is IA\(/\(Ol>minsup so that concept C is called as Frequent concept therein 101 is the cardinal number of object 0 which is the number of the transaction in the database Lattice structure is made up by frequent equivalent quantified concept is shortened as FEQCL Equivalent quantified concept which is formed by intension B is defined as C B and frequent equivalent quantified concept sets \(shortly named as FEQCS which is contained to all of extension cardinal number what is N written down Definition4.3 Supported that C=\(A B AI is the frequent concept in the FEQCS if there is the equivalent intention Bi in the Equ A coming into existence B,EB j=l*-.k l<=i<=k B is named as C\222 s maximal equivalent intention  written down MaxEquInten\(C if any of frequent conceptC\222=\(A\222 B\222 lA\222l  A\222 A  toward the FEQCS not to exist MaxEquInten\(C c MaxEquInten\(C\222 so that frequent concept C is named as Maximal frequent concept Proposition4.1 In the FEQCS\(C\(N two elementary quantified concepts which are equivalence between Cl=\(Bl and C2=\(B2 whose sufficient and essential condition is C\(B~UB C\(N Proposition4.2 In the FEQCS\(C\(N\there are two elementary quantified concepts, the one is Cl=\(Nl Bl other is C2=\(N2 B2 content BlB2,Cl would be equal with C2 FEQCS\(C\(N 5 Mining Association Rule in the FEQCL Definition5.1 Lattice concept which is decided by context\(O,D,R y C=\(A,B  Support\(C lO means supporting degree of concept C Therein 01 is cardinal number of the context 0 D R extension I A I is cardinal number of the concept C extension Definition5.2 Supposed that C=\(A B=\(B BZ   Bk were the concept of quantified expand concept lattice\(with the exception of complete concept\Support\(C is beyond the given threshold value S so C is defined as frequency concept in the quantified expand concept lattice therein every group of elementary intension Bi\(i=l  k is elementary frequency item set redundancy intension of C and comparatively redundancy intension of C is also called

US Coast Guard approved personal floatation devices must be supplied and inspected where employees are engaged in work where there is danger of drowning Required employee protection in public work areas to include the following  Warning signs or flags and other traffic control devices  Barricades for additional protection to employees  Barricades around excavated areas  Warning lights at night prominently displayed Lines or equipment which may be sub to backfeed from cogeneration or other sources are to be worked as energized in accordance with the applicable paragraphs of the Rules Comments w APPA submits the following comments regarding this Special Conditions section Recommends that the wording regarding capacitors be modified to include a waiting period for five minutes prior to short circuiting and grounding in accordance with industry standards for discharging of capacitors For series street light circuits, recommends that language be added for bridging to either install a bypass conductor or by placement of grounds so that work occurs between the grounds Recommends modification of the section regarding personal floatation devices to not apply to work sites near fountains decorative ponds swimming pools or other bodies of water on residential and commercial property Definitions x This section of the proposed Rules includes definitions of terms Definitions particularly pertinent to understanding the proposal and which have not previously been included are listed as follows Authorized Employee  an employee to whom the authority and responsibility to perform a specific assignment has been given by the employer who can demonstrate by experience or training the ability to recognize potentially hazardous energy and its potential impact on the work place conditions and who has the knowledge to implement adequate methods and means for the control and isolation of such energy CZearance for Work  Authorization to perform specified work or permission to enter a restricted area Clearance from Hazard  Separation from energized lines or equipment Comments x The following summarizes the changes in some of the definitions which APPA recommends Add to the definition for authorized employee It the authorized employee may be an employee assigned to perform the work or assigned to provide the energy control and isolation function  Recommends that OSHA modify the definition for a line clearance tree trimmer to add the word qualified resulting in the complete designation as a qualified line clearance tree trimmer Recommends that OSHA modify the definition of qualified employee" to remove the word construction from the definition since it is felt that knowledge of construction procedures is beyond the scope of the proposed rule resulting in APPA's new A2-18 I 


wording as follows more knowledgeable in operation and hazards associated with electric power generation transmission and/or distribution equipment Recommends that OSHA add a definition for the word practicable and replace the word feasible with practicable wherever it appears in the proposed regulations and that practicable be further defined as capable of being accomplished by reasonably available and economic means OTHER ISSUES Clothing OSHA requested comments on the advisability of adopting requirements regarding the clothing worn by electric utility industry employees EEI has presented comments which indicates research is underway prior to establishing a standard for clothing to be worn by electric utility employees However EEI's position is that this standard has not developed to the extent that it could be included in the OSHA Rules Both APPA and EEI state that they would support a requirement that employers train employees regarding the proper type of clothing to wear to minimize hazards when working in the vicinity of exposed energized facilities Grandfathering Due to the anticipated cost impact on the utility industry of the proposed Rules requiring that existing installations be brought to the requirements of the proposed Rules both APPA and EEI propose that the final Rules include an omnibus grandfather provision This provision would exempt those selected types of facilities from modification to meet the new rules EEI states that if the grandfathering concept is incorporated that electric utility employees will not be deprived of proper protection They propose that employers be required to provide employees with a level of protection equivalent to that which the standard would require in those instances in which the utility does not choose to modify existing facilities to comply with the final standard Rubber Sleeves OSHA requests comments from the industry on whether it would be advisable to require rubber insulating sleeves when gloves are used on lines or equipment energized at more than a given voltage EEI states its position that utilities should continue to have the option of choosing rubber gloves or gloves and sleeves to protect employees when it is necessary to work closer to energized lines than the distances specified in the clearance tables Preemuting State Laws EEI requests that the final Rules be clear in their preempting state rules applicable to the operation and maintenance work rules for electric power systems. This is especially critical since some states now have existing laws which are more stringent than the proposed OSHA Rules Examples are 1 in California and Pennsylvania where electric utility linemen are prohibited from using rubber gloves to work on lines and equipment energized at more than certain voltages and 2 in California and Connecticut where the live line bare hand method of working on high voltage transmission systems is prohibited One utility Pacific Gas  Electric has obtained a variance from the California OSHA to perform live line bare-hand transmission maintenance work on an experimental basis Coiiflicts Between the Rilles and Part 1926 Subpart V Since many of the work procedures in construction work and operation and maintenance work are similar and difficult to distinguish between EEI requests that the final order be clear in establishing which rule has jurisdiction over such similar work areas A2-19 v 


IMPACTS ON COSTS AND ASSOCIATED BENEFITS In its introduction to the proposed rules OSHA has provided an estimate of the annual cost impact on the electric utility industry for the proposed des of approximately 20.7 million OSHA estimates that compliance with this proposed standard would annually prevent between 24 and 28 fatalities and 2,175 injuries per year The utilities which have responded to this proposed standard through their respective associations have questioned the claims both of the magnitude of the cost involved and the benefit to the industry in preventing fatalities and lost-time injuries Both EEI and APPA feel that the annual cost which OSHA estimates are significantly lower than would be realized in practice Factors which APPA and EEI feel were not properly addressed include the following OSHA has not accurately accounted for cost of potential retroactive impacts including retrofitting and modifying existing installations and equipment OSHA has not consistently implemented performance based provisions in proposed rules  many portions require specific approaches which would require utilities to replace procedures already in place with new procedures Estimates were based on an average size investor-owned utility of 2,800 employees and an average rural cooperative of 56 employees, which are not applicable to many smaller systems such as municipal systems OSHA has not adequately addressed the retraining which would be necessary with modifying long-established industry practices to be in accordance with the OSHA rules EEI claims that OSHA's proposed clearance requirements would not allow the use of established maintenance techniques for maintaining high voltage transmission systems and thus would require new techniques For an example of the cost which is estimated to be experienced as a result of the new Rules one of the EEI member companies has estimated that approximately 20,000 transmission towers would need to be modified to accommodate the required step bolts in the Rules at an estimated cost of 6,200,000 Additionally this same company estimates that the annual cost of retesting live line tools for its estimated 1,000 tools would be 265,000 Additionally, both EEI and APPA question the additional benefits which OSHA claims would result from implementation of the new Rules APPA questions the estimates of preventing an additional 24 to 28 fatalities annually and 2,175 injuries per year in that it fails to account for the fact that the industry has already implemented in large part safety measures which are incorporated in the Rules EEI and APPA also point out that many preventable injuries cannot be eliminated despite work rules enforcement and safety awareness campaigns since many such accidents which result in fatalities are due to employee being trained but not following the employer's training and policies PRESENT STATUS OF RULES According to information received from the OSHA office in February 1993 the final Rules are to be published no later than July 1993 and possibly as soon as March 1993 OSHA closed their receipt of comments in March 1991 and no further changes in the rules are thought possible A2-20 


CONCLUSION The OSHA 1910.269 which proposes to cover electric utility operation and maintenance work rules affects a multitude of working procedures as are summarized in this paper It is not possible at the present time to assess the final structure of the Rules as may be proposed in 1993 or subsequent years Since the comments from the utility associations APPA and EEI were made following the initial release of the proposed OSHA Rules in 1989 a significant amount of time has elapsed where other events have occurred which may affect the form of the final Rules The 1993 NESC went into effect in August 1992 and includes some of the requirements to which the commenters objected For example a significant requirement in the Part 4 of the 1993 NESC requires that rubber gloves be utilized on exposed energized parts of facilities operating at 50 to 300 volts This requirement is in conflict with EEl\222s proposed change to the OSHA Rules which would still allow working such secondary facilities without the use of rubber gloves Electric utilities are advised to review the January 31 1989 proposed operation and maintenance Rules as summarized in this paper and to review their procedures which would be affected by application of the Rules Many of the procedures proposed in the Rules provide valuable guidance in electric utilities\222 operation and maintenance activities Where the cost impact is not significant, it is recommended that utilities consider implementing such procedures in expectation of the Rules being published in the next few months Also it would be appropriate for electric utilities to review the 1993 edition of the NESC since there are portions of the Rules which have resulted in changes in the NESC These changes mainly occur in Part 4 Rules for the Operation of Electric Supply and Communications Lines and Equipment The concerns which the commenters have addressed regarding the cost impact and the resulting benefits experienced as a result of the promulgation of the Rules are real ones and must be addressed in the final Rules As a result this paper cannot present a conclusion regarding the full impact of the Rules The development of such Rules continue to be an ongoing matter and will undoubtedly require later analysis when the final rules are published A2-21
