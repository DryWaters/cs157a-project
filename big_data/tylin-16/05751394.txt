However, it is not feasible for the sensors to send the whole behavioral data to the sink because of the limited resources such as power, processing capacity, storage etc. available to the sensors. So, efficient data gathering mechanisms are required for sensor association rule mining. One recent and efficient data gath ering mechanism for sensor networks has been proposed by Azzedine et. al, which exploits redundancy between sensor activities and uses a data gathering tree called MNDGT \(Minimum Node Data Gathering Tree\. In this paper, we have tried to enhance the algorithm proposed by Azzedine et. al by removing mo re redundancy between sensor activities. Simulated experimental results have shown that the enhanced version has reduced the amount of data to be sent to the sink to a great extent I  INTRODUCTION Wireless Sensor Networks\(WSN is a network of sensors which are capable of sensing, processing and transmitting Each sensor monitors differ ent parameters such as light temperature, humidity, etc. and reports to a predefined central node\(s\k\(s\ multi hop mode of transmission WSN has been found to be very useful in various fields such as military applications, agriculture, weather monitoring  and forecasting, forest fire monitoring, physical environment monitoring  3  In addition to the unreliable wireless communication nodes of a WSN have to work with limited resources such as limited energy, limited processi ng capacity, limited storage limited memory, limited communication capacity, etc. So WSN suffers from lot of prob lems such as lost messages delay in data delivery, loss of data, data redundancy, etc. [3   resu lting in poor qu alit y of service\(QoS\s techniques and protocols have been suggested to improve the QoS of W   Recently, data mining techniques have been found to be very useful to extract the patter ns describing the behavior of the sensors and the network, which can be used to improve the performance and QoS of the network. Among various data mining techniques, association ru les, called sensor association rules, have been used extensively in WS   Sensor association rules find the temporal relationships among the sensors. As an example, one sensor association rule may look like s 1 s 2    s 3 s 4   This rule states that if events are received from sensor s 1  and s 2  there is a 75 chance of receiving events from sensors s 3  and s 4  within   units of time. This rule can be used to predict the sources of future events, identify the faulty nodes and predict the overall behavior of the network. Mining sensor association rules involves two steps: the first step is about collecting the behavioral data, which shows the sensor activities, and the second step is about finding association rules from the behavioral data. This pape r is about the first step  Collecting sensor behavioral data is a costly affair in a sensor network because of the limited resources of the sensors So some aggregation techniques such as sum, average, count etc. are used to reduce the data size and number of messages These techniques are not suitab le for application to sensors data activities. Again, it has been fo und that there exists lot of redundancy in the sensor behavioral data, which is responsible for consuming more resources in the network. So, a data reduction mechanism is required to reduce the amount of data to be sent to the sink node\(s\wo mechanisms for collecting data - direct reporting and distri buted storage - can be found in   One recent and efficient da ta reduction mechanism for mining wireless sensor networks has been reported in [8  which exploits the redundancy among the sensor activities The data reduction is implemented on top of a data gathering tree called MNDGT\(Minimum No des Data Gathering Tree which is constructed from nodes that will participate in the mining process. In this paper, we have tried to enhance the technique given in y re mov i ng  m o re red u n d anc y  f r o m  th e behavioral data. It has been found from the experimental results\(simulated\at the enhanced version reduces more data than that of the technique reported in  


  Rest of the paper has been organized as follows. Section II explains the sensor ass ociation rules, followed by section III which discusses in-network data reduction mechanism briefly Section IV gives the enhanced data reduction mechanism Section V and VI presents the experimental results and conclusion respectively II  SENSOR  ASSOCIATION  RULES Association rule mining is an important data mining technique and has been used ex tensively in various domains    12 Ho w e ver sen s or associatio n ru le m i n i n g is a li ttle bit variation from the association rules discussed in n d  can be defined as follows.  Let S  s 1  s 2 s n be the set of sensors in a sensor network. Let time is divided into equal sized slots t 1   t 2  t m such that t i+1  t i   where  is size of each time slot T his   t m  t 1 is the historical period of the data defined during the data extraction process  is the historical period of the data defined during the data extraction process.  A set of sensors P  s 1 s 2 s k is called a pattern of sensors.  An epoch is a couple E  E ts  P uch that all sensors in the pattern P detect events within the same time slots Ets and a  sensor database DS also called behavioral data\ is defined to be a set of such epochs Table I\och E  E ts  P said to support  a  pattern P 1 if P 1   P  The frequency of a pattern P 1 in DS is the number of epochs in DS that supports P 1 Sensor association rules between two patterns P 1  and P 2  are the implication of the form P 1   P 2 where P 1  P 2    S and P 1   P 2   Support of the rule is the frequency of P 1    P 2 and confidence of the rule is calculated as frequency P 1    P 2 frequency P 1  T ABLE I: D ATABASE OF EPOCHS   T S   T IME  S  SENSORS  Ts Epoch 1 s 1 s 2  s 5 2 s 1 s 3  s 5  3 s 2  s 4   WSN can be assumed to be consist of a set of sensors nodes S  s 1  s 2  s 3  s n Time is divided into slots of equal size   Each sensor has a buffer B one entry for each time slot. At the end of every time slot, each sensor sets the corresponding buffer entry to denote whether an event has been detected at that time slot. For example, a sens or  buffer with seven  time slots may look like  0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1  which shows that events have been detected by the sensor during 3 rd 4 th  and 7 th  time slots  III  A  NEW  IN-NETWORK  DATA  REDUCTION  MECHANISM  TO  GATHER  DATA  FOR  MINING  WIRELESS  SENSOR  NETWORKS  8 Sensor nodes in a sensor networ k are required to send the activity set\(behavioral data\ to the sink\(s\or mining sensor association rules. However, it is not feasible or desirable to send the whole activity set to th e sink\(s\ the limited resources available to the sensor nodes. Moreover, there exists lot of redundancy in the behavi oral data.  So, an efficient data gathering mechanism is required for gathering the behavioral data The reduction technique proposed in a n e f ficient on e for gathering behavioral data beca use it is the first algorithm which has tried to reduce the redundancy in the behavioral data. The technique is  implemented on top of a tree called Minimum Node Data Gathering Tree\(MNDGT\hich consists of the nodes that will be required for mining sensor association rules and maintaining the minimum distance from the sink node. Once the tree is constructed, it is used to remove the redundancy in the messages to be sent to the sink and the same tree is used to r elay the data to the sink. For this purpose reference set and difference set are constructed for every node in the tree. These reference sets and difference sets are sent to the sink, and the original activity set of the nodes are reconstructed in the sink from these reference sets and difference sets. The whole proc ess is little bit complex. So due to space limitation, it will no t be possible to discuss the complete algorithm in detail. However, readers may go through the pape o r th e c o m p lete al g o rit h m   IV  THE  ENHANCED  DATA  REDUCTION  MECHANISM The proposed data reduction me chanism to gather data for mining sensor association rules is an enhancement of the data gathering mechanism reported in I n th e algorithm  th e  sensor nodes have to send the difference sets to the sink However, it has been found that for a large network, the difference sets also become very large, and there exists a lot of redundancy in a large difference sets. Our aim is to reduce the redundancy in difference set. F or this purpose, we have used the same technique as used th e dif f ere n ce set A s  f o r example, let us consider an activity set as given in Table II for a sensor network with 16 nodes s 1  s 2  s 16 ink node and 8 time slots\(1, 2,..., 8\. The corresponding reference set difference set and the set of messages to be sent to the sink by the sensors are given in Tables III, IV and V respectively Table II: A CTIVITY SET  Sensor ID Activity Set s 2  1, 2, 3, 4, 5 s 4  1,3, 4, 5, 6 ,8 s 5  1, 3, 4, 5 s 7  1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 s 12  1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 s 13  1, 2, 3, 5, 8 s 14  1, 3, 4, 5 s 16  1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 T ABLE III: R EFERENCE SET  Parent ID Reference Set s 2  1, 3 s 3 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 s 7  1, 3 s 10  1, 3, 5 s 12  1, 2, 3, 4, 6 


  In this context, readers are re quested to refe o r th e  methods of construction of reference set, difference set and message set It can be observed from the message set that there is a lot of redundancy in the messages\(column diff-set of Table V\sent to the sink by the sensors. As for example while s 7 is sending { 5 }, { 2, 4, 6} and {2, 5, 6, 7, 8} to the sink, it has to send 5 twice, 2 twice and 6 twice, which is not desirable. Our aim is to remove this type of redundancy by reducing number of messages, resulting in more saving of energy of the sensors. For this purpose, we have grouped the messages \(Sender ID, Diff set\ such a way that every message is included in exactly one group, one Sender ID occurs in a group only once, and at the same time number of groups should be minimum. Using this rule, the messages in Table V have been divided randomly into three groups as shown in Table VI Now, the in-network data reduction technique w ill be used for each group separately to send them to the sink. On receiving the groups, the sink will reconstruct the original message table. This way, number of messages to be sent to the sink will be reduced to a great extent  T ABLE IV  D IFFERENCE SET  Sensor ID Diff-AN Diff-RN s 2  2, 4, 5  s 3    S 4   s 5  4, 5  s 7  2, 5, 6, 7,8  s 10   5 s 12  8 2, 4 ,6 s 13  2, 8  s 14  4  s 16  7  T ABLE V  M ESSAGES TO BE SENT BY THE SENSORS  TO THE SINK  Type Sender ID Ref code Diff-set SensorID AN s 10  s 10  3, 8 13 AN s 10  s 10  4 14 AN s 12  s 12  8 12 AN s 12  s 12  7 16 RN s 7  s 7  5 10 RN s 7  s 7  2, 4, 6 12 AN s 7  s 7  2,  5, 6, 7 ,8 7 AN s 2  s 2  2, 4, 5 2 AN s 2  s 2  4, 5 5 RN s 2  s 2   7 AN s 3  s 3   4  T ABLE VI  M ESSAGE GROUPS  I II III s 10  3, 8 s 10  4 s 7  5 s 12  8 s 12  7 s 2  s 7  2, 5, 6, 7, 8 s 7  2, 4, 6   s 2  2, 4 , 5 s 2  4, 5   s 3       V  EXPERIMENTAL  RESULTS Several simulated experiments have been conducted to study the performance of the proposed data reduction mechanism and the in-network data reduction mechanism  The simulation is based on C++, with 961 sensors deployed in a grid of 300m  300m. The sensors are 10m apart among themselves, and each of them can communicate with its eight neighbors. TDMA based MAC protocol has been assumed for the experiments, and the experi ments are based on the number of messages to be sent to the sink node. It has also been assumed that each element in ac tivity sets and different sets will be sent in a separate message to the sink node A slot size of 30 seconds, a nd historical period of 3 days and 5 days have been used for the experiments. The simulator has been run several times to find the number of messages for support values of 10% to 90 Figures  1 and 2 show the number of messages for different support values. It can be observed from the experimental results that proposed data reduction mechanism has reduced number of messages to a great extent in comparison to the in-network data reduction mechanism  Figure 1 : Number of messages versus support values for 3 days 


   Figure 2: Number of messages versus support values for  5 days VI  CONCLUSION This paper has presented an enhanced version of the innetwork data reduction mechanism proposed by Azzedine Boukerche. The experiments have shown that the enhanced version has been able to reduce the number of messages to be sent to the sink to a great extent. However, more experiments may be required to evaluate th e performance of the algorithm REFERENCES 1  F.

   Fig. 3  Frequent set generation using fuzzy logic      Fig. 4  Frequent set generation using genetic algorithm    2  Frequent set generation using Genetic algorithm In this phase the frequent item sets are generated and association rules are extracted using genetic algorithm. The evolutionary approach considered in this paper involves the codification of individuals in the form of chromosomes. The pre-processed numerical data is taken as input and maximum and minimum value of all attributes is calculated. Using the maximum and minimum values of all attributes calculated the individuals are codified. The codification of individuals is performed by two structures Upper and Lower  The upper structure of the individual contains all the attributes present in the data set taken and their corresponding interval limits .The interval limits are given by an upper limit U i and lower limit L i The lower structure contains the type of the attribute in terms of the values 0, 1.The value 0 is used to represent that the attribute does not belong to the individual and value 1 is used to represen t that the attribute belongs to the individual. The structure of an individual is given in figure 5   Fig. 5  Example of an individual   Where x1, x2,x3 represent  the attributes of the dataset. The codified individuals in the form of chromosomes are subjected to the three genetic operators Selection, Crossover and Mutation 1\ Selection From the codified individuals obtained the genetic operator of selection is implemented using tournament selection. Tournament selection process works by evaluating the individuals using the fitness function and best fit individuals are selected from the population to perform the process of crossover  2\   Crossover From the individuals obtained after selection process, the genetic operator of crossover is performed between two individuals to produce a new offspring. Here two parent individuals X and Y,wh ich are chosen by means of tournament selection are made to perform a crossover between them to produce a new child individual Z Let [l i x u i x   i y u i y   i z u i z  e in ter v als w i th lo w e r li mit l i  and upper limit u i in which the attribute a i varies for the individuals  X,Y,Z respectively. Let t i x t i y t i z be the type of the attribute a i taken for the individuals X, Y, Z respectively. For each attribute a i two cases possibly occur based on the types present in the lower structure of the individual considered   Case 1:   if \(t i x t i y en t i z t i x  l i z u i z  dom\(l i x l i y random\(u i x u i y   Case 2:    if  \( t i x  t i y   then l i z u i z l i x u i x  t i z t i x  l i z u i z l i x u i x  t i z t i y   The crossover between the indivi duals is shown pictorially as in figure 4    15   28 38    39      43   59  110  X1                X2               X3 Upper structure Lower structure 


3 Mutation The selected individuals are subjected to    the genetic operator mutation. The mutation process can be defined as any change that is made to the gene of the individual that is subjected to mutation. The change is determined by the probability of the randomly selected individual. In this paper mutation is focused on the type t i of the attribute in lower structure of the individual. Mutation is done by two types Null Mutation and Not Null Mutation. In the process of Null Mutation if the type t i of the selected attribute is not null \(1\en it is changed to null \(0\ the process of Not Null Mutation if type t i of the selected attribute is null \(0\en  it is change d to not null \(1\he Mutation process is pictorially represented as shown in figure 5  Now the individuals that are obtained from the crossover and mutation genetic process are evaluated using the objective function called the fitness function. If the fitness of the new individual obtained  is higher then it is allowed to enter into next generation to compete with other individuals else the individual is discarded. This process is performed in an iterative fashion for N generations and the best individuals are extracted      Fig. 6  Crossover between individuals   C  Evolving TODOs The class association rules obtained from the frequent sets generated by using fuzzy logic and frequent sets generated by using genetic algorithm. Our proposed method uses lift measure to prune the necessary rules from all association rules From the rules that are pruned using lift measure, the leverage measure is applied on these rules to find the unexpected associations between them and the rules are arranged in descending order of leverage values. Then the top 10 rules are pruned and are termed as the required outliers \(TODOs\which consequently have confidence and lift values nearer to 1    Fig. 7  Mutation of  individuals    IV  EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS  We carried out several  experiments on a real world dataset named ozone level detection  dataset to evaluate the proposed approach. This data set  contains data  collected from the year 1996 to 2003 at the Houston, Galveston and northern parts of Brazoria area in west of south central United states of America. In this paper the proposed methods of Outlier detection by using fuzzy logic was compared with the method of Outlier detection  by using Genetic algorithm\(without discretization\ in terms of accuracy as the performance measure. The following table I depicts the relationship between the data size and accuracy of the outliers detected for the two methods, Outlier detection  by fuzzy logic and Outlier detection  by genetic algorithm\(without discretization\.The table I also shows the maximum and minimum confidence of the outliers generated for each data size  Figure 8 maps the relationship between the two methods Outlier detection by fuzzy logic and Outlier detection by genetic algorithm \(without discretization\in terms of accuracy and data size. It can be easily seen from the figure that the  accuracy of the outlier detection by fuzzy logic method is more accurate than outlier deduction by genetic algorithm method for any given data size. The accuracy of outlier detection by fuzzy logic method is high because the confidence of the outliers gener ated by fuzzy logic are higher the confidence of the outliers generated by genetic algorithm   1  1 0   20   35            4.0 5.0         3.2   5.3   0  1 0   22    38 60   65 40   45   1  1 0   20   35 50   62 33   51  Parent X Parent Y Child Z       Rand \(32, 40\,Rand \(45,53  Rand \(40, 60\,Rand \(50,65   0  1 1   11   26 35   58 42   55   1  1 0   15   28 38   59 43   58   1  1 1   11   26 35   58 42   55   1  0 0   15   28 38   59 43   58  Individual Y Individual X Individual X Individual Y Scheme of Not null mutation Scheme of Null mutation

Genetic algorithm overcomes the problem of generating irrelevant rules by considering the entire interval of the attributes taken without performing discretization Fuzzy logic overcomes the problem of crisp boundaries by considering natural boundaries of attributes. These two methods are used to generate temporal outlier which aids to find out the unexpected parameters that causes ozone day/normal day from ozone level detection database. From the experimental evaluation it has been identified that the outliers generated by fuzzy logic are mo re accurate than the outliers generated by Genetic algorithm \(invariable of the data size The accuracy of outlier detection by fuzzy logic method is high because the confidence of the outliers generated by fuzzy logic are higher the confidence of the outliers generated by genetic algorithm   R EFERENCES   1  Han, J. and Kamber, M  Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques. 2 nd  e d San Fransisco Morgan Kaufmann 2006 2  H S Song, Jae Kyeong Kim and Soung Hie Kim,  "Mining the change of customer behavior in an  internet shopping mall   Expert Systems with Applications Vol  21, No 3, pp 158  168, 2001 3  Rakesh  Agrawal,  Tomasz  Imielinski,  and  Arun  Swami  Mining Association  Rules  between  Sets  of   Items  in  Large  Database s Proceedings of 1993 ACM SIGMOD Washington DC,USA, pp 207   216 4  Rakesh Agrawal and Ramakrishnan Srikant  Fast  Algorithms  for Mining Association Rules in Large Database s  Proceedings of the  20th International Conference on Very Large Data  Bases,  1994, pages 478  499 5  Srikant.R and Agarwal.R  Mining Quantitave Association Rules in Large Relational Tables   Proceedings of ACM-SIGMOD 1996 International  Conference on Management of Data Monreal Canada pp1-12 6  T.Dhanya and D.Nagesh kumar, îData mining for Evolving Fuzzy Association rules for Predicting Monsoon Rainfall of Indiaî, Journal of Intelligent Systems, Vol 18 No:3,2009 7  Fayu and Wang  Application of Multidimensional Association Rule Techniques in Manufacturing Resource Planning   Syste m  2010  Seventh International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery FSKD 2010 8  Neelu Khare Neeru Adlakha K.

In the Mylyn dataset, the proposed method reduces the number of rules from1347 down to 13, while the delta of the prediction performance was only .015 \(from .757 down to .742\terms of the F1 value. And, in the Eclipse PDE dataset, the proposed method reduces the number of rules from 398 to 12, while the prediction performance even improved \(from .426 to .441 On the other hand, two naÔve rule reduction methods, which simply remove rules whose confidence values are smaller than the given threshold, could also reduce the number of rules, but in these cases the prediction performance became extremely low We compared our rule-based prediction with conventional model-based approaches such as logistic regression, random forest, CART and naÔve Bayes classifier. As a result, the proposed association rule mining approach was able to produce accuracy that is comparative to commonly used machine learners. This indicates the reduced rule set is worthwhile and important Through an analysis of a reduced rule set, it is confirmed that our proposed rule reduction technique provides a better understanding of the causes of faulty modules Part of this work was conducted under Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research \(C 24680003  Agrawal, R., Imielinski, T. and Swami, A.: Mining Association Rules between Sets of Items in Large Databases Proc. of 1993 ACM SIGMOD Intêl Conf. on Management of Data,Washington, D.C., USA, pp.207-216 \(1993  D'Ambros, M., Lanza, M., Robbes, R.: Evaluating Defect Prediction Approaches: a Benchmark and an Extensive Comparison, Empirical Software Engineering, Published online, DOI 10.1007/s10664-011-9173-9, \(2011  Eclipse Mylyn Open Source Project http://www.eclipse.org/mylyn   Eclipse Plug-in Development Environment \(PDE http://www.eclipse.org/pde   Hamano, Y., Amasaki, S., Mizuno, O. and Kikuno, T Application of Association rule mining to Analysis of Risk Factors in Software Development Projects, JSSST Computer Software, Vol.24, No.2, pp.79-87\(2007  Kamei, Y., Monden, A., and Matsumoto, K.: Empirical Evaluation of SVM-based Software Reliability Model, In Proc. 5th ACM-IEEE Intêl Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering \(ISESE2006\p.39-41\(2006  Kamei, Y., Monden, A., Morisaki, S., and Matsumoto, K.: A Hybrid Faulty Module Prediction Using Association Rule Mining and Logistic Regression Analysis, In Proc. 2nd Intêl Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement \(ESEM2008\p.279-281\(2008  Kim, S., Whitehead, Jr., E.

differential dependencies  DD s in real applications like violation detection in this paper we study the problem of determining the distance thresholds for metric distance constraints from data Instead of manually specifying requirements of various statistical measures we conduct the determination in a parameter-free style i.e to compute an expected utility of the distance threshold pattern and return the results with the maximum expected utility Several advanced pruning algorithms are then developed in order to efìciently nd the desired distance thresholds Finally the experimental evaluation on three real data sets demonstrates the performance of our proposed methods In particular we evaluate the effectiveness of returned results in the violation detection application and show that the pruning techniques can achieve lower time cost A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No 611411 National Grand Fundamental

By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
