decision-making has become a priority. This paper studies how to use data mining methods in the Apriori algorithm for mining association rules in university research management system Keywords data mining; association rules; research management system; database  I   I NTRODUCTION  With the in-depth development of information technology in colleges and universities, more and more colleges and universities to enable the research management system, and accumulated a large amount of data in the application. Southwest Petroleum University was officially opened in 2011, Southwest Petroleum University research 
management system, the same year Economics and Management of independent research and research management system of the School of Economics and Management and put into trial operation. The main functions of the system is the foundation for scientific research data management \(add, modify, delete\of the system data is more limited, data query and statistical reports to the relevant functional departments, leading. Data mining and effective use of long-term accumulation of large amounts of data can not effectively support the research management and decision-making. This paper introduces the data mining concept on the basis of the research association rule mining 
in university research management system, in order to optimize and improve the existing research management systems    1  Fund: Southwest Petroleum University of Humanities and Social Sciences Special Fund \(2012RW011  II  R ELATED CONCEPTS OF DATA MINING  Data mining is a large number of incomplete, noisy fuzzy and random data; extract the invisible, pre unknown the potential value of information and knowledge for decision-making process. Through data mining can be found hidden in a lot of data behind the information and knowledge, and generate decision support information 
support, or helping to lead decision-making A  Basic concepts of association rules 1  Association rules from data mining to meet certain conditions dependent relationship is of the form çX \002 Y support = s%, confidence = c% "rule. The main target of the association rule mining is transaction data  2  Confidence the set D of all affairs in support for transaction sets X, if c% of the transaction also supports the transaction sets Y, then c% is called the confidence of the association rule X \002 Y. The confidence levels the strength of the rule, expressed confidence \(X \002 Y  3  Support in the entire transaction set D, if s% of 
transactions to support both transaction sets X and Y, then s% is called the support of the association rule X \002 Y Support levels the frequency of the rules ,  expressed support \(X\ong them, the minimum support is expressed by the Minimum Support \(minsup  4  Frequent Itemsets the support of the transaction sets X support \(X\ not less than the minimum support minsup claimed that X is a frequent itemset. Support and confidence are greater than a given threshold rules are called strong rules. Data Mining is the mining strong rules  Usually associated rules can be described using the following mathematical model: I = {i1, i2, ..., in} for the data itemset, D is the whole transaction set, each transaction T has 
a unique identity for TID. On the data itemsets X 002 I, Y 002 I that X contains Y, if and only when X 002 Y. Association rules in the form: \(X \002 Y, support \(X \002 Y\ = s%, confidence \(X 002 Y\ = c%\ Here X 002 I, Y 002 I, and X\003Y 003 X-called conditions of the rule, known as Y-the result of the rule Association rule mining consists of two phases: \(1\ to find all frequent itemsets from the transaction database; \(2 to generate association rules by the frequent itemsets B  Apriori algorithm The basic idea of Apriori algorithm is to find frequent 
itemsets based on the candidate itemsets, and the frequent itemsets support is not less than the predefined minimum support. Apriori algorithm first calculate 1 - itemsets C1, ie candidate 1 - itemset \(k-itemset is of containing k-item set to identify all the frequent 1 - itemsets L1, then according to the frequent 1 - itemsets to determine the candidate 2 itemsets to identify frequent 2 - itemsets L2, from candidate 2 - itemsets, turn down, until no longer designate the set of options The specific algorithm is described as follows Input: DB, minsup

As the number of transactions increased the running time also increases. BBO ARM tends to converge as the number of transactions grows. Accuracy of generated rules is 100%.The combination of BBO with a-priori query optimization make association rule mining yield fast results. The association rule mining problem is modeled as a multi-objective combinatorial problem which is solved using BBO    V  C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE S COPE  In this paper,we have tried to use the robustness of BBO in a way of sharing information between the solutions in combination with a-priori principle.The results generated after applying the technique on the dataset,includes the desired rules with richer quality .Those rules help in deciding the pattern as to how different items in a supermarket can be arranged for lucrative results.The results show that the proposed model can attain profitable and optimized performance in terms of minimum support and number of items  REFERENCES  s am a M Bada w y  A bdE l h a y  A  S a l l a m Moh a m e d I Habib \223Quantitative Association Rule Mining using a Hybrid PSO/ACO algorithm \(PSO/ACO-AR  Man i s h S a gg ar A sh i s h K u m a r ag ar w a l  A b h i m a ny u L a d 223Optimization of Association Rule Mining using improved Genetic algorithm\224 International Conference on Systems,Man and Cybernetics,\(ICSMC\22204\3725 3729  r ad Yk h l ef  223A  Qu a n tum S w ar m e v olu tio nary  algorithm for mining association rules in large databases\224 Journal of King Saud University \226 Computer and Information Sciences \(2011\3, 1\2266  e te r P  W a k a biW ais w a Ven a n s i u s B a r y a m u r eeba a n d K Sarukesi \223Generalized Associaton Rule Mining using Genetic algorithm\224 5 R A g ga r w a l  T  I m i l i ns ki a nd A  S w a mi 223 M i nn i n g  association rules between sets of item in large databases\224  S i m o n 223 Biog eog r aphy  B as ed Opti m i zation  223 IEEE Transaction on Evolutionary Computation ,Vol 12, No.6 December 2008 7 V  K   P a nc ha l  Sa mi k s ha G o e l  M i t ul B ha t na ga r    223Biogeography Based Land Cover Feature Extraction\224 World Congress on Nature and Biologically Inspired Computing, \(NaBIC\22209\588-1591, Coimbatore India , Dec 2009

In addition, it also has useful photographs; experimental designs contact details, feedback forms, etc. However, if the user is interested in availing services \(information and modelling one needs to furnish login details 1  Information Services This includes real-time AgriSens sensory information and weather station-based information as well as the collected surveillance information. A link is also provided to access/view meteorological data from various regional weather stations  Each sensor \(Mote\ deployed in the field collects micro-level weather and its data in text mode raw data\.  These data are converted in to useful units \(real data\ real-time and shown in appropriate structured format automatically.  The user can download the information using SQL queries and import the data in various OSC standard formats \(CSV, Excel, XML, etc.\In addition, this tool has the facility to upload user defined data so as to use the data for further analysis. Users can also obtain details about groundnut Pest/Disease \(Thrips, BNV, LS and RT\ptoms, their life cycle and various control measures with respect to pest/disease infections severity  Fig. 7.  Pest/Disease infection severity with respect to crop age  Fig. 8.  Pest/Disease prediction simulation 2 Modelling Services This serves to the user community to simulate pest/disease incidences and predictions of any week/stage of the crop. For example, Fig. 7 shows findings on 15/9/2010 \(Kharif 2010 season\ with 10 week old crop on Thrips \(14.91%\f Spot 50.99%\, Rust \(33.75%\ and Bud Necrosis \(44.25%\tion severity. Models developed with DM techniques are served as back-end. By using the developed cumulative \(CWK\nd non-cumulative \(1WK prediction strategies, the pest/disease can be simulated to a given weather/environment/user defined simulated data.  The user can enter weather data or the system can use week wise available data to simulate the predictions \(Fig 8 Sliding bars are provided so as provide smoother simulation of weather parameters     Fig. 9  CWK -Rust  prediction simulation A screen shot of CWK prediction for 10 week old Rust disease is show in Fig. 9 with corresponding weather parameters. User can also see the symptom of groundnut crop and control measure as per the simulation and severity of pest/disease. The control measures are described as per the advice for the records of Agro-met Cell [3   Similarly, other pest/disease can also be simulated for predictions  


8  IV  C ONCLUSIONS  Interactions and hidden relationships between most prevailing and interrelated groundnut crop pest/disease and dynamic weather parameters were quantitatively established with the help of WSN and DM techniques in conjunction with ground level surveillance data in a test bed falling in semi-arid tropics. Real-time micro-climatic parameters such as temperature, humidity and leaf wetness were obtained from Zigbee based AgriSens distributed sensing system, whereas the crop-weather-environment-pest/disease dynamics and hidden relations were quantified from various developed/ tailor-made DM techniques It has been observed that BNV infection dynamics are related to the presence of pest Thrips \(which is a vector for the rapid BNV disease infection\, similarly rust infection are related to leaf spot incidences. These quantified/mining based correlations through empirical and MVR model that has been used to issue the forecast \(non-cumulative\for population buildup, initiation and severity of pest/disease. Apart from this a cumulative prediction model also has been developed, which found to be more accurate than the non-cumulative strategy observed with two seasons data with multiple sowing dates This will help to take judicious ameliorative decisions so as to save the crop from infection and its subsequent effects on environment and crop yield. The developed GNPM-DSS is a user friendly system designed for novice users, which can also be used not only with the embedded sensory information and models but also can be used with the user-defined data/models R EFERENCES  1  Agrawal, R., Imielinski, T. and Swami, A.N. \223Mining Association Rules between Sets of Items in Large Databases\224, SIGMOD.

improvement is only about 1500 from 5500 to 4000 in Figure 6 Nevertheless DAP  PAP can still keep the lowest time cost in all the test in Figure 6 VII C ONCLUSIONS Motivated by the utility of differential dependencies  DD s in real applications like violation detection in this paper we study the problem of determining the distance thresholds for metric distance constraints from data Instead of manually specifying requirements of various statistical measures we conduct the determination in a parameter-free style i.e to compute an expected utility of the distance threshold pattern and return the results with the maximum expected utility Several advanced pruning algorithms are then developed in order to efìciently nd the desired distance thresholds Finally the experimental evaluation on three real data sets demonstrates the performance of our proposed methods In particular we evaluate the effectiveness of returned results in the violation detection application and show that the pruning techniques can achieve lower time cost A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No 611411 National Grand Fundamental

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
