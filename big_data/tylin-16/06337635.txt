Abstract 
The fast updated frequent pattern tree \(FUFP-tree\ an efficient data structure for association-rule mining. Hong et al. \(2009\roposed an approach for the maintenance of the FUFP-tree structure after the deletion of transactions However, all transactions in the original database might need to be rescanned to determine the occurrence of infrequent items, which were not stored during the mining and maintenance process 
The rescanning process steps can be timeconsuming depending on the original database size and number of rescanned items. The study in this paper enhances Hong et. al.ês approach. In the proposed algorithm, the infrequent 1-itemsets are stored during the maintenance process and the rescanned items are pruned out step by step to reduce execution time. Experimental results verify the performance of the proposed algorithm

I Introduction 
Apiori 
 
 Many efficient techniques and algorithms for data mining have been develope e of t h e m o s t  common issues in data mining is finding association rules in transaction databases [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11  most association-rule mining algorithms, the rules are mined as fast as possible Many algorithms for mining association rules from transaction databases are based on the algorithm Agrawal et al., 1993a\hich repeatedly scans the 
database to generate and process candidate itemsets level by level and thus has a high computational cost Han et al. \(2000 pos ed th e  f requ en t patter n tree \(FP-tree\tructure for efficiently mining association rules without the generation of candidate itemsets. In real-world applications, the transaction databases are continuously updated, with transaction insertion and deletion being common  Efficient maintenance algorithms are thus required for these operations. The efficient incremental fastupdated-frequent-pattern-tree \(FUFP-tree\aintenance 
algorithm for handling transaction insertion was proposed by Hong et al. \(2008 w h o later propos ed  an FUFP-tree maintenance approach for transaction deletion \(Hong et al., 2009\7 The latter algorithm is used to maintain the FUFPtree structure after transaction deletion without reconstructing the FUFP-tree from the beginning However, the original database needs to be rescanned to determine the occurrence of infrequent items, which are not stored during incremental mining This present study enhances the FUFP-tree 
 
maintenance algorithm for deleted transactions Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has good performance in incremental handling deleted transactions

A Frequent pattern tree 
 In this section, research related to the proposed algorithm is briefly reviewed   Han pro pos ed th e FP t ree s t ru ct u r e f o r  efficiently mining association rules without the 
generation of candidate itemsets. FP-tree is used to represent a database in a tree structure, in which only frequent items are kept. The root node of the tree is set to Null. A 
Header-Table 
consists of the frequent items sorted in descending order of their frequency as well as pointers which link to their first occurrence nodes in the FP-tree. Nodes that have the same item name are linked in sequence

 The FUFP-tree \(Hong et al. 2009\7 con s t ru cted  like the FP-tree except that it has bi-directional links between parent nodes and their child nodes. The bidirectional links speed up tree traversal when items are processed in the maintenance process When transactions are deleted from the database the proposed algorithm processes them to maintain the FUFP-tree without reconstructing it from the updated database. Depending on whether items are large in the original database and in the deleted transactions, there are four cases to consider. Each case is processed separately and the FUFP-tree are appropriately updated if necessary    and çPart 2 To process case 4 are çPart 3 and Part 4  In this algorithm, we have some points need to be improved: In part 2 and part 4, because the items in the corresponding branch are different from each other once one of the items in  appears in one node of the branch, this item and this node should not be considered in subsequent runs. In part 3, because the infrequent items are not stored during the incremental mining process, the original database needs to be rescanned to determine their frequencies. This step is thus the most time-consuming step. The computation time of this step linearly increases with the number of transactions in the original database, the number of items in each transaction \(the length of each transaction\d the number of items in the set of        The enhancements described in section II.B are given in pseudo-code below An original database  corresponding  toring the frequent items in descending order, its corresponding FUFP-tree support threshold  and a set of t deleted transactions  An updated FUFP-tree for the updated database  is a function that removes an item completely from the FUFP-Tree by removing all nodes with the same item, connecting the children of these nodes directly to their parent nodes, and finally removing the item from is a function that determines which items of a given item list appear in a given transaction. These items are sorted in descending order of their frequency is the branch generated from the frequent items in a transaction according to the order of items appearing in

   An example is shown below to illustrate the proposed algorithm for maintaining an FUFP-tree after transactions are deleted shows the database used in the example. The original database contains 10 transactions and 12 items, from to    The support threshold is set at 50%. For the given database is 5, and the frequent 1-itemsets are     and from which can be constructed. The FUFP-tree is then built from the original database and The results are shown in   Assume that the last four transactions \(7 to 10\re deleted from the original database. The proposed algorithm proceeds as follow In the initial steps, the four deleted transactions are first scanned to get the items and their counts. Frequent items are stored in and infrequent items are stored in based on 4 ◊ 50 2. The frequent items and infrequent items of the original database are stored in and  respectively, during the FUFP-tree construction. The items of the four cases when deleted transactions are Case 1 Case 2 Case 3  stored in Case 4 stored in  In part 1, line 2, the frequent items which appear in are processed. The for an item to be frequent in the updated database is \(10 Ö 4 3. The items in are Their frequencies in deleted transaction are On line 3, the new count of item in the updated database is 7 3 = 4, which is greater than the minimum count. Line 4 updates the frequency of in to 4 is thus still frequent for the updated database so lines 6 to 9 are not used. Lines 10 and 11 are activated to update the new count of in to 4 and to place in the set of For item which belongs to case 2 is 7 Ö 1 = 6. The frequency of  in and in is updated to 6 on line 4 and line 10. Lines 5 to 9 are not used because the  statement on line 5 is not satisfied is added to on line 11. The next two items and are processed similarly to and For  5 Ö 3 = 2, which is less than the of the updated database and thus is no longer frequent. The statements in lines 5 and 6 are satisfied, so is moved from to and

Item which belongs to case 2, is processed in the same way as item  and FUFP-tree obtained after part 1 are shown in  and are updated, and   In part 2, lines 12 to 21, updates the FUFP-tree according to the deleted transactions with items in The deleted transactions and the items appearing in are shown in   Each transaction in the deleted transactions is processed. For transaction 7, line 13 uses the function to get the items of the transaction which appear in and place them into a temporary item list called The statement on line 14 is because  The corresponding branch of this transaction in the FUFPtree is B Lines 17 to 21 decrease the frequency of the corresponding nodes in the branch Each node in branch is processed. First   appears in Line 19 decreases the count of  by 1, and thus the new frequency of in the branch is 7 1 = 6 is removed from Because in a branch of the FUFP-tree, each item appears only once it is unnecessary to consider the item in subsequent runs. Therefore item is pruned from after being processed, which speeds up the FUFP-tree updating in part 2 of the algorithm The next node  is treated the same way. The count of in the branch is reduced to 2 and in is deleted. Like transaction 7, transactions 8 and 9 have and appearing and their corresponding branches are also so they are handled in the same way. After transaction 9 is processed, the frequency of in the branch is 0 Thus it is removed from FUFP-tree on line 20. For transaction 10, function on line 13 returns The corresponding branch of this transaction in the FUFP-tree is  Lines 17 to 21 decreas e the count of nodes  and in  the branch from 3, 3, and 3 to 2, 2, and 2, respectively and the FUFP-tree obtained after part 2 are shown in  and are unchanged   Part 3, generates the for case 4. The items that satisfy case 4 are stored in the  temporary list in the initial steps Each item will be processed. On line 24, the count in the updated database of items in are calculated from the original count, which is taken from and the count in the deleted transactions, which is taken from For  4 Ö 1 3, which is greater than 0 and equal to of the updated database so becomes frequent after some transactions are deleted and needs to be rescanned. The frequencies of in and in are updated to 3 on lines 27 and 29, and is added to With 3 Ö 1 = 2, k is still infrequent in the updated database so it is skipped. For item  in is 3, but does not appear in any deleted transactions, so  0 3 Ö 0 = 3 becomes frequent in the updated database, and thus the new frequency of is updated in and and is inserted into After line 30 On line 31, the items in are sorted in descending order in term of their frequency. Here, no sorting is needed. After lines 32 to 34 are executed and are added to the end of as shown in and are moved to

Part 4 updates the FUFP-Tree according to the transactions in the updated database and the list shows the corresponding branches in the updated database with items in     Transaction 1 is used to illustrate the steps from lines 35 to 47. The items of transaction 1 appearing in are stored in a temporary list called The corresponding branch of transaction 1 in the FUFP-Tree is  The corresponding branch is stored in a temporary variable For there is no matched item in the branch Line 46 is executed is inserted at the end of the branch The pointer in of item is updated pointing to The branch is recalculated on line 47. The corresponding branch of transaction 1 is updated  The next item in is which does not exist in the branch Therefore is added as a new child node of node  at the end of the branch. Like transaction 1, transaction 2 has in its corresponding branch in FUFP-tree is  appears in the branch, so its frequency in the branch is increased from 1 to 2, and it is removed from because each item appears only once in one branch of the FUFP-tree, so there is no need to rescan a node if it is already processed also exists in the branch thus its count in the branch is updated from 1 to 2, and it is deleted from the branch to prevent it from being rescanning to speed up the algorithm. Transaction 3 is discarded because it has no items that need to be rescanned. Transaction 4 has in Its corresponding branch is There are no matched items in  and are added at the end of this corresponding branch. The last two transactions \(5 and 6\lso ignored because no items need to be rescanned Lines 48 to 54 update the frequency in of the items in case 3  For  4 Ö 2 = 2. The frequency of in  is updated to 2. The same procedure is applied to  4 Ö 3 = 1, and the count of h in  is set to 1. For  3, and 3, so 3 Ö 3 = 0. The statement on line 51 is true and is removed from on line 52  shows the final results     Experiments were programmed in C# on a laptop with an Intel 1.73 GHz quad-core CPU and 8 GB of RAM, running MS Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bits. Two real datasets called BMS-POS and MUSHROOM were used in the experiments. The BMS-POS contained several years of point-of-sale data from a large electronics retailer. There are 515,597 transactions with 1,657 items in the dataset. The maximal length of a transaction is 164 and the average length of the transactions was 6.5. There are 8,124 transactions with 22 items in the MUSHROOM The parameters in this experiment were set to those used by Hong et al. \(2009\The first 500,000 transactions were extracted from the BMS-POS database to construct an initial FUFP-tree. For the MUSROOM, the first 8,000 transactions are used. For each run, the last 100 transactions from the last updated database were used as deletion transactions The was set to 3%, 5%, and 7%, respectively The execution times obtained from the two algorithms with three different minimum support thresholds are shown in Each value is the average execution time of the two algorithms over 5 runs The execution time of the proposed approach is much lower than that of the original approach. The main reasons are that the original algorithm counts the original frequencies of infrequent items in the original database whereas the proposed algorithm takes them directly from which is created during FUFP-tree constructions. In addition, the items of  and are stored in a temporary list, and items are pruned step by step after being processed The proposed algorithm thus makes fewer comparisons when traversing the temporary list

  An enhanced FUFP-tree maintenance approach for transaction deletion was proposed. The algorithm speeds up the calculation of the frequency of infrequent items in the original database by not rescanning the database and the list The number of comparisons is reduced when updating the FUFP-tree by traversing the corresponding branches and finding the matched items appearing in and/or because the number of items in the set of and are stored in a temporary list and pruned step by step. The experimental results for the BMS-POS and the MUSHROOM datasets with different minimum thresholds indicate that the proposed approach decreases the execution time compared to the original algorithm. The numbers of nodes of the FUFP-tree constructed by the two algorithms are the same. The proposed approach requires more memory to keep the list of frequent items and infrequent items of the original database. The proposed algorithm is more efficient for large databases. For small databases with a few thousand of records, such as MUSHROOM, the difference is not very clear. In the future, based on properties and the structure of FUFP-tree, we can improve the performance of the algorithm for handling transactions insertion          Ag ra w a l, T  Im ieli n s ki, A  S w a m i. çDatabas e  Mining: A Performance Perspectiveé.

obtained compared to other setting i.e 6.59 for conìdence and 6.50 for conviction when the left boundary is 50 and the weight is 1 0.5 0 Then we vary the right boundary between 300 and 450 with a step of 50 when the left boundary is xed to 50 which is the best left boundary beforehand The results indicate that ranking performance is good when the right boundary is less than 400 That is the best performances the lowest average ROM are 6.57 for conìdence and 6.48 for conviction when the right boundary is 400 and the weight is 1 0.5 0 As conclusions the result of manual boundary setting implies that the left boundary should be set to 50 while the right boundary should be placed around 400 Furthermore the boundaries assigned by the manual setting are close to ones obtained from the automatic setting This result implies that our automatic boundary setting region-based weighting approach can provide suitable regions for setting different weights in ranking mechanism This paper proposed a region-based ranking method to improve discovering news relations The proposed method achieved the best performance by setting the weighting of the rst the second and the third region to 1 0.5 and 0 respectively with the average ROM of 6.57 and 6.46 for conìdence and conviction consecutively By comparing to the non-region method when the weights are set to 0 0.5 and 1 the experimental results showed that for the whole range the proposed method improves the performance with the average ROM improvement of 11.87 1.21 and 28.32 for conìdence and 11.91 4.83 and 29.04 for conviction respectively As future works to provide more practical similarity the possibility of applying latent semantic indexing or some disambiguation methods will be examined It is possible to apply a machine-learning approach to nd the optimal parameter setting in ranking mechanism This work was granted by Strategic Scholarships Fellowships Frontier Research Networks 2006 from the Commission on Higher Education and NECTEC under project number NTB-22-KE-38-54-01

improvement is only about 1500 from 5500 to 4000 in Figure 6 Nevertheless DAP  PAP can still keep the lowest time cost in all the test in Figure 6 VII C ONCLUSIONS Motivated by the utility of differential dependencies  DD s in real applications like violation detection in this paper we study the problem of determining the distance thresholds for metric distance constraints from data Instead of manually specifying requirements of various statistical measures we conduct the determination in a parameter-free style i.e to compute an expected utility of the distance threshold pattern and return the results with the maximum expected utility Several advanced pruning algorithms are then developed in order to efìciently nd the desired distance thresholds Finally the experimental evaluation on three real data sets demonstrates the performance of our proposed methods In particular we evaluate the effectiveness of returned results in the violation detection application and show that the pruning techniques can achieve lower time cost A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No 611411 National Grand Fundamental

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
