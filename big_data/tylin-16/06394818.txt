 Association Rules Mining for Academic Cooperation Based on Time Extension and Duration Accumulation Fang Huang, Zhike Zou, Xinmin Liu and Jiefeng He School of Information Science and Engineering Central South University Changsha 410083, China e-mail: hfang@mail.csu.deu.cn   Abstract Academic relations originated from academic activities are of particular temporal features. The academic activities which happen more recently, last longer period and have more occurrence will be more possible to form valuable academic relationships and more meaningful to be analyzed For the characteristics of the accumulated time and vague 
boundaries of valid time with academic cooperation, the strategy of time extension and duration accumulation is introduced into the algorithm of progressive partition association rules mining. In the proposed method, the time attribute of academic activities transaction records are mapped and extended on time series, and the duration period is marked according to time partition. Through progressive partition processing, the academic association rules mining with continuous time accumulation is realized. This paper presents basic principle and realization process in details, and takes information about research projects and co-published papers as cases to mine academic relationships. The 
experimental comparison and results analysis show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm Keywords-academic cooperation relations; time extension duration partition accumulation; association rules mining I   I NTRODUCTION  Academic Relation Network \(ARN\ a kind of Social Networks \(SN\. In scientific research and academic activities, academic relationships, such as co-authoring who published paper, participating in research projects, attending in seminars and joining academic associations together, form academic relation networks. It has an important significance to analysis ARN in the evaluation of science and technology 
especially in the peer-reviewed. For which, we propose an extraction method of academic relationships based on association rules mining. We can get the potential relationships between researchers by using the academic relationship association rule mining, which is a foundation for building the academic relation networks. It not only helps to look for collaborators in some new cross-disciplinary, but also provides a reference to hunt for technology professionals for research institutions or companies, while provides decision support for selecting technology assessment experts Since the traditional association rule mining does not describe the time properties of each item, and lacks of the 
support calculate methods with time restraint, the traditional algorithm does not suit to the association rule mining with time attribution [1-2 s t h e ac ad em ic pa rtn e rsh i p w ill change over time, it has obvious temporal features. In the traditional method, the counting occurrence of itemsets is a unique factor to calculate frequency set, which will result in missing some important association rules in a specific time period, so that it is unable to get valuable academic cooperation relationships. Therefore, the results of association rules mining with time constraint are more meaningful for the description of academic relationship Chang-Hung Lee proposed a Progressive Partition Mining 
PPM\gorithm sed o n t e m p o r a l  i t e m s e t s t o c a l c ul a t e the support  which solves the problem of association rules mining with time gradual change. Generally, there are two types about the occurrence time of academic activities. The first category is which happens at some time point, such as cooperating publishing papers. The second is which occurs within certain time period, such as cooperating research project. Since the beginning, continuation and ending of academic partnership is a gradual process, its boundary of the valid cooperative period is usually vague and uncertain But the PPM does not consider above the two problems. In this paper, for the gradual changes characteristics, the 
proposed method of Time Extension and Duration Accumulation \(TEDA\ are introduced into PPM in order to obtain valuable academic relationship. The results of mining will be more effective on academic relationship analysis II  A NALYSIS OF A SSOCIATION R ULES M INING FOR A CADEMIC C OOPERATION  Some special cooperation between researchers, such as co-authoring papers, participating in research projects joining academic community and so on, formed academic relations. The first two are the most common academic partnerships. Usually, the two kinds of cooperation 
information have the most complete records and also it is the most representative of academic cooperation. So we take academic paper and research project as a case to analyze the association rules mining of academic relationship by using the traditional Apriori algorithm. We collected data from project application as original database, which are provided by the information service platform of science and technology assessment, and the records of publishing papers and participating projects are used as transaction database The samples of academic activities transaction database are

Through the traditional Apriori mining, the minimum occurrence number of each data item should be S  D  min_Supp 15*0.3=4.5, rounded to 5, where D 15 is the total number of transactions occurrence, that is total number of records in transaction database. The frequent 1-itemsets {A}, {C}, {E}, {B} are found according to the greater than minimum support threshold, and the numbers of occurrences are 10, 10, 7, 6 respectively. In 2-itemsets, the numbers of occurrences of {A, C}, {A, E}, {A, B} are 6, 5, 5 respectively, which are frequent itemsets according to the minimum number of occurrences. There is no frequents in 3itemsets because of not meeting the minimum support Finally, we can only get the association rule \(B=>A\, the support Supp 5/15=33% and confidence Conf 5/6=83 In academic activities transaction database, since the people who earlier publish their papers or participate research project have more records than later, which is the greater likelihood to be taken as frequent item sets due to meet the minimum support. Thus, the acquired association rules by using Apriori is more from these people who have published their papers or a participated project for a long time. However, as time going by, there are some new association rules produced by the emerging of academic activities, which are more valuable to analyze academic relationship. This new relations will be less possible to be calculated as frequent itemsets in traditional algorithm. To solve this problem, the Progressive Partition Mining in [3 is  employed to mine the association rules of academic relationship. The recent transaction items will be more possible to be calculated as frequent itemsets. However, the simple time partition in PPM cannot deal with the problem that transaction occurrence time is duration and its boundary vague. In TABLE I, t 3 and t 6 are transaction records of participating projects. These researchers continue to work on the project for a long time will be more possible to be as frequent itemsets. The other transactions except t 3 and t 6 are the records of publishing papers, and the beginning and ending time are all the same, that is date of publishing papers But the academic relationship of co-authoring paper will be extended to the before and after of publishing papers actually Therefore, we propose to standardize the date of academic transaction record into time sequence, and we properly extend the occurrence period of transaction according to time sequence, and we also mark the continuous time of transaction to relevant time partition. Finally, mining association rules with progressive partition accumulating is realized III  S UPPORT C ALCULATION AND P ARTITION A CCUMULATION  Since cooperators vary in different years and different academic activities, the cooperation relations are changing over time. Progressive Partition Mining is association rules algorithm based on Apriori. In which, the first appearance time of each data item is used to restrict evaluation of support and confidence, and indexing records by the different earliest time of each item is executed in marked partition transaction database with multiple scanning A  Calculation of support and confidence with time constraint Accroding to the characteristics of academic relationship the calculation of support and confidence with time constraint are  re-described on the basis of  3  and [4 Definition 1 When a  b are taken as the earliest and latest occurrence time respectively X as itemset, the X  a  b is temporal itemset, VCT X is Valid Cooperate Time Since the earliest occurrence time of academic activities for different researchers is not same, academic cooperate association exists in Valid Cooperate Time, that is to say there exists the longest time of academic cooperate relationship Definition 2 When X  X i  VCT  X i  a i  b i  i 1,2, n the VCT  X max a i min b i  The support and confidence of the academic relationship association rules follow as The support of temporal itemset X  VCT  X is       VCT X VCT X VCT X TXT Supp X db db 002\003   1  Where X VCT  X  is equivalent to X  VCT  X the db VCT  X   is the total number of transactions that X occurrence in the time partition, and the numerator is the number of transaction including X in same partition

 The support of academic cooperate association rule is        VCT XY VCT XY Supp X Y Supp X Y 002  002  2  It  is support of cooperator X and Y in their common time partitions The confidence of academic cooperate association rule is           VCT XY VCT XY VCT XY Supp X Y Conf X Y Supp X 002  002  3 The denominator  is support of cooperator X appears in the common partition of X and Y Thus, we can get all strong association rules according to above formulas B  Partition accumulation process In PPM,  the records of transaction database are indexed by using the method of progressive time partition. And the partition size corresponds with time granularity. Usually, the week, mouth or year is taken as time granularity depending on different application. All records of transaction database are divided into many partitions by marking P 1 P 2 P n The time partition indexing progress for transaction database is shown in Fig. 1. Firstly, the frequent itemsets is produced from the first partition P 1 then these frequents are accumulated to partition  P 2 forming candidate itemsets which can produce frequent itemsets of P 1 P 2 This process is repeated until produce frequent itemsets for all partitions P 1 P 2 P n Using the last frequents can generate a proper subset to build strong association rules. In each partition accumulation, the occurrence numbers of every item in candidate set are re-counted because of accepting frequents from the front partition. The final accumulated result is from the first to current time partition. The mining process is implemented gradually by progressive time, which means to mine academic relationships from some time in the past to now. The purpose of pruning is to put away some items' calculation which doesn't meet the minimum support    IV  P ARTITION M ARK WITH T IME E XTENSION AND D URATION  The temporal partition mark of data record is based on the time attribute in the transaction database of academic activities, and the attribute recorded the duration of the transaction. Usually, the academic relationship mining from transactions of academic activities last for a longer time will be more stable. In addition, the beginning and ending time of academic activities cannot fully reflect the duration period of academic relationship. In general, the duration of academic relation existence should be longer than that of transactions Therefore, we use the partition mark method based on time extension and duration to solve this problem A  Time extension Since the boundary of period is gradual change in academic relation, the extension and merging [5 e employed in academic association rules mining. The time extension is to expand outward two points of the beginning and ending time. The merging by time partition has an effect on the fuzzy boundaries. After using time extension, it is unavoidable to lose detail information comparing with the previous one. If extending pro rata, the proportion of lost detail information will be consistent. As to guarantee relative accuracy, we extend the time attribute in proportion which is named as extending factor f 0 f 1\. Temporal data item X  a  b n be extended by a certain factor into a new temporal item X  a  b and the calculation formula of the new beginning and ending time is    10  10 aa baf if a b bb baf aa f if a b bb f 003 003   004 004\005 006\007 010 005 006 011   004 004\005 006 006 007\010 012 011  004 003 006  011 006  004 012 012 4  While expanding time in proportion, with the larger f the more detail information will be lost, which bring about the larger influence in temporal data mining. So the value of extended factor depends on the specific application. In generally, we try to determine the value f by experiment exploratory. Its worth noting that the time attribute of transaction is the actual date of transaction appeared. To deal with convenience, the date of the beginning and ending time should be mapped to uniform time axis before mining temporal data, and its resolution is the smallest unit of the time attribute in transaction database B  Duration time partition mark The method of progress partition accumulation is used to scan academic activities database in PPM. So the transaction records must be marked by time partition. It is real significant to mine academic relations on annual. As shown in TABLE II, we take year as partition granularity. All transaction records are divided to three partitions P 1 P 2 and P 3 corresponding to 2007, 2008 and 2009 respectively. The mapped time range is 1-12, 13-24 and 25-36. The time extension and partition mark are shown in TABLE II.

Its resolution unit bases on month and  Extended range must be limited to 1-36 Partition of transaction record should be marked by extended time range such as t 6 is marked in the three partitions P 1 P 2 and P 3 so that the item information of t 6 can be accumulated in the three continuous partitions. Thus t 6 will be more possible to be frequent itemset TABLE II  T IME E XTENSION AND P ARTITION M ARK  TID Itemsets Time range Extended range Partition t 1  B, C 3, 3  2  4   P 1  t 2  A, C 7, 7   6 8   P 1  t 3  A, B, C 8, 19  6  21   P 1 P 2  t 4  C, D 10, 10  9  11   P 1  t 5  A, B, C 12  11  13 P 1 P 2  t 6  A, D, E 13  1 0  36 P 1 P 2 P 3  t 7  A, B, D 15  1 4  16 P 2  t 8  C, E 16  1 5  17 P 2  t 9  A, C, E 18  1 7  19 P 2  t 10  A, B, E 22  2 1  23 P 2  t 11  C, D 27  2 6  28 P 3  t 12  E, F 32  3 1  33 P 3  t 13  A, C, F 34  3 3  35 P 3  t 14  A, B, C, E 35  34  36 P 3  t 15  A, D, E 36  3 5  36 P 3  V  P ROCESS OF M INING A CADEMIC R ELATIONSHIP A SSOCIATION R ULES  For the transaction database of academic activities, the time attribute of all records should be firstly mapped to time sequence with resolution unit month. After extending time range, transaction records are marked by time partition with taking a year as partition granularity. Then, candidate 2itemsets and frequent 2-itemsets are produced due to scan the records of database according to the strategy of time partition progressive accumulating. The frequent 2-itemsets are taken as candidate items in order to produce proper subset and form candidate association rules. Finally, evaluate the support and confidence for each candidate rule to get strong association rule. The mining is started directly from 2itemsets specialized in improving time cost in this process Table III, IV and V present the specific process of producing candidate 2-item and frequent 2-item with the min-support and min-confidence as 0.3 and 0.75 respectively. The first partition P 1 is processed as shown in TABLE III, in which Itemsets is candidate 2-itemsets  Min-cnt as the minimum number of support threshold, and  Frequent as whether frequent itemset. Selecting three frequent 2-items from P 1 are accumulated into the processing of second partition P 2 which form the candidate itemsets of P 1 and P 2 As shown in TABLE IV, all the candidates were divided into two parts. Those items in P 1 P 2 are appearing in P 1 and P 2 simultaneously, others are only appearing in P 2  and they have different minimum number of support 4 and 3 So four frequent items are selected and accumulated into processing P 3 as candidate itemsets of P 1 P 2 and P 3 In TABLE V, the candidate itemsets are composed of three parts P 1 P 1 P 2 and P 1 P 2 P 3 Finally, six frequent 2-itemsets are generated by using similar statistics process TABLE III  P ROCESS P 1  000\003 Itemsets Count Min_cnt Frequent P 1  A B 2 2 yes A C 3 yes B C 3 yes C D 1 no A D 1 no A E 1 no D E 1  no TABLE IV  P ROCESS P 1  A ND P 2   Itemset Count Min_cnt Frequent P 1 P 2  A B 6 4 yes A C 6 yes B C 5 yes P 2  A D 2 2 yes A E 3 yes B D 1 no B E 1 no C E 2 yes D E 1 no TABLE V  P ROCESS P 1   P 2  A ND P 3   Itemset Count Min_cnt Frequent P 1 P 2 P 3  A B 7 6 yes A C 8 yes B C 6 yes P 2 P 3  A E 6 4 yes A D 4 yes C E 3 no P 3  A F 1 2 no B E 1 no C D 1 no C F 1 no D E 2 yes E F 1 no

 The frequent itemsets getting from TABLE V are taken as candidate itemsets of academic relationship association rules. As shown in TABLE VI, C 2 includes all candidate 2itemsets Time_  partition represents partitions where the candidate 2-itemset appeared in. C 1 is all 1-itemsets from C 2  broken down. The candidate association rules are produced by using proper subset of C 2 which are only used to calculate the support and confidence of candidate association rules corresponding in time partitions, and the support value for every item are shown in Support  TABLE VI  C ANDIDATE I TEMSETS OF A SSOCIATION R ULES  Candidate Time_  partition Support C 2  A B P 1 002 P 2 002 P 3  0.41 A C P 1 002 P 2 002 P 3  0.47 B C P 1 002 P 2 002 P 3  0.35 A E P 2 002 P 3  0.5 A D P 2 002 P 3  0.33 D E P 3 0.33 C 1  A P 1 002 P 2 002 P 3  0.82 B P 1 002 P 2 002 P 3  0.47 C P 1 002 P 2 002 P 3  0.7 A P 2 002 P 3  0.83 D P 2 002 P 3  0.42 E P 2 002 P 3  0. 67 D P 3 0.67 E P 3 0.5  According to co-occurrence partitions of candidate itemset to generate the temporal association rules, the support and confidence of each rule is calculated and evaluated. Selecting strong association rules which meet threshold are shown in TABLE VII TABLE VII  S TRONG A SSOCIATION R ULES  Rules Supp Conf B => A    [1, 3  0 41  0 87  B => C    [1  0 35  0 75  E => A    [2, 3  0 5  0 75  D => A    [2, 3  0.33  0.8  The strong association rules {B=>A} [1, 3 in  T A B L E  VII can be explained as follows. B and A have strong partnerships in the time partitions P 1 P 2 and P 3 which indicates that A participated in 85.7% of the activities B in same partitions, and the support is 41%. Other relationships can be analogized. In addition, A, D and E participate in the cooperation projects with longer duration and they recently published paper. So the three partners have strong cooperation relationship in P 2 and P 3 which become strong association rules {E=>A} and {D=>A}. If using the traditional Apriori algorithm, only the strong association rules {B=>A} can be obtained, which means A and B have strong relationship but  lost others cooperation relations VI  A NALYSIS EXPERIMENT  For the database of technology project application 2009 the proposed time extension and duration accumulation algorithm is used to mine academic cooperation association rules. We developed Java programs to input application reports and transform XML data into SQL statements. Then extract information about all research projects and published papers as transaction record to insert into database MySQL 5.0, which finally formed academic activities transaction database Using the two mining algorithms of Apriori and Time Extension and Duration Accumulation, the amount of strong association rules under different supports are compared by using histogram and shown in Fig. 2 000\023 000\030 000\024\000\023 000\024\000\030 000\025\000\023 000\025\000\030 000\023\000\021\000\023\000\026 000\023\000\021\000\023\000\027 000\023\000\021\000\023\000\030 000\023\000\021\000\023\000\031 000\023\000\021\000\023\000\032 Minimum support Association rules 0007\000\(\000'\000 000 000S 000U\000L\000R\000U\000L  Figure 2  Comparing the number of strong association rules Since the Apriori mining algorithm does not consider the occurrence time of academic activities, the size of strong association rules are less than 10, and no rules to be obtained when min-support more than 0.05. While the number of association rules in the TEDA is more than in the Apriori at same min-support. The results show a lot of valuable association rules are taken out, which lost before. With increasing min-support, the number of rules will decline When the min-support rises to 0.05-0.06, it is stable. In this experiment, the support threshold is 0.05 to form the original sets of academic cooperation association rules Fig. 3 presents the impact of extending factor of TEDA algorithm. In which, dotted and solid line respectively indicates the amount of change in trends for strong association rules under different extending factors, and the min-support takes as 0.03 and 0.05. Since time extending is on month and partition accumulating is on annual, the extending factor has little effect on the results of strong association rules when f smaller value. The bigger impact will be gradually produced with increasing value more than 0.5. The size of extending factor is usually determined by the time characteristics of academic activities As for the running efficiency, when the extending factor f is 0.1 and the minimum support threshold varies from 0.03 to 0.07, the average running time of the TEDA algorithm is 6.8 seconds which is nearly four times faster than that of the Apriori algorithm that is 27.4 seconds in our case

It solves the problem of mining temporal association rules with duration and its boundary fuzziness. We use the proposed method to mine academic activities transaction database with information of research projects and publishing papers. The gained strong association rules shown that academic activities with  higher frequency, longer duration and more recently will be more easily to be stable and valuable academic relationships. In this method, the time extension factor of transaction items is determined through experiments tries, which is fully depended on the different applications. So, to study a method for selecting the extension factor appropriately will be one of future work  A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was supported by Project 61073105 of National Natural Science Foundation of China  R EFERENCES  1  R.

In theory ERT-RICO has a space complexity of O 2 n 1 20 n 4\\; in practice the space required is much smaller than that, due to the fact that different segments generate a large number of duplicate rules.

It has been used as a standard dataset to evaluate other prediction methods, and hence was deemed appropriate for evaluating the performance of the ERT-RICO protein secondary prediction method.  To search for the optimal segment length value n and the optimal threshold value t we used RS126 as input to the ERT-RICO prediction method with different combinations of n and t  values, as shown in Table I. When n 9 and t 0.8, ERT-RICO gives the best prediction results, an average Q 3 score of 92.19%.  The highest Q 3 scores for a single protein domain in the RS126 set is 100%, for all combinations of n and t values which means the prediction is 100% accurate for that particular protein domain. The lowest Q 3 scores for a single protein domain vary. One interesting future research topic is to explore how to increase the lowest Q 3 prediction score. Another observation is that when n 5, and t 0.9 \(the same parameters used in [1 y  R T RI C O t h e Q 3 score is 90.41%, which is slightly higher than the Q 3 score generated by RT-RICO 89.93%, in [1  T h e sm all in c r ease in th e s c o r e is m a in ly d u e t o  the fact that we improved the mechanism in extracting homologous protein domains from BLAST results for this research study. It may also partly be due to the fact that the data in protein databases increases every day, and data used in [1  was extracted one year ago TABLE  I  Q 3  S CORES OF ERT-RICO WITH D IFFERENT S EGMENT L ENGTH AND T HRESHOLD VALUES ON RS126  T EST D ATASET  Segment Length n  Threshold t  Average Q 3  for 126 Protein Domains Highest Q 3  for One Protein Domain Lowest Q 3  for One Protein Domain 5 0.5 91.75% 100.00% 42.63 5 0.6 91.76% 100.00 42.63 5 0.7 91.76% 100.00 42.63 5 0.8 91.67% 100.00 42.95 5 0.9 90.41% 100.00 42.95 5 1.0 82.44% 100.00 42.11 7 0.5 92.14% 100.00 48.90 7 0.6 92.11% 100.00 48.90 7 0.7 92.13% 100.00 48.90 7 0.8 92.16% 100.00 48.90 7 0.9 92.04% 100.00 48.90 7 1.0 91.89% 100.00 48.90 9 0.5 92.15% 100.00 41.38 9 0.6 92.14% 100.00 41.38 9 0.7 92.18% 100.00 41.38 9 0.8 92.19 100.00 41.38 9 0.9 92.02% 100.00 41.38 9 1.0 91.34% 100.00 37.93 Table II provides a snapshot of how BLAST results are converted to segments and rules, when n 9 and t 0.5. Rules are generated at threshold value of 0.5, because the same rules can be used for any t value bigger than or equal to 0.5. The maximum number of homologous proteins \(unique PDB IDs returned by a BLAST search for a particular test protein domain is 978, the minimum number is 1, and the average number is 103.14. The 9-residue segments are used to generate rules. The maximum number of 9-residue segments generated for a test protein domain is 208,671, and the minimum number is 31. The maximum number of rules generated for a test protein domain is 7,819,061, and the minimum number is 15,731, at n 9 and t 0.5. None of the test protein domain from the RS126 set uses offline processing. One interesting question is if the prediction result would be improved significantly if we use larger n values, such as 11, 13 or 15, etc. By observing Table I, we feel that the improvement would not be significant if any. We should note that when n is increased by two theoretically the program running time and space requirements to store the rules\ would both increase by four times \(an exponential growth\We will continue to experiment with different n values, but at this time, the current optimal n and t  values provide very good prediction results, and acceptable response time. The test programs \(rule-generation and prediction for RS126 set, at n 9\were written in PERL and 


executed on a computer with Intel Dual-Core processor, 32 GB of RAM, and Windows 7 OS. The total program running time was approximately 21 days. In this research study, we used all proteins with significant sequence alignments \(certain blast scores\o generate rules. This resulted in long rule generation time for a small number of test protein domains, because they have a large number of homologous proteins. This can be improved by developing a different algorithm for selecting proteins for rule generations, which we intend to do for our future research. Thus the total running time can be further reduced TABLE II.

It is always debatable if a particular test dataset will favor a subset of methods, or if one test dataset is better than the other test datasets. Early this year there were around 71,000 proteins unique PDB IDs\ith known secondary structure in the Protein Data Bank \(PDB\atabase. If all these 71,000 proteins can be used to evaluate a particular method, the resulting Q 3  score should be very representative. But this is a very demanding test approach, because almost all prediction methods require significant computing resources to perform prediction for even one protein. Most test datasets use only around 100 to 500 protein domains. Regardless, if a method can use all available data for testing, the resulting Q 3 score should be very credible. In order to use all available data for testing, program running time is the key RS126 set is a very representative test dataset; none of the protein domains require offline processing. In [1  w e  f o u n d  t h at  the current offline processing algorithm normally produces lower Q 3 scores. Now after acquiring the optimal n and t  values, we can use these values to develop a better offline processing algorithm. Other test datasets like the CB396 set which requires offline processing, can be used to test the future offline processing algorithm V  C ONCLUSION  Based on the BLAST-RT-RICO protein secondary structure prediction approach [1  p r esen te d  in  th is p a p e r  w a s a n  improved rule-based data mining method, BLAST-ERT-RICO which utilizes data from proteins with significant sequence alignments, and generates rules that can be used in predicting protein secondary structure. BLAST-ERT-RICO has an improved time complexity of O  m log m  n ver the O  m 2 2 n  complexity of BLAST-RT-RICO. This  is vital because it allows us to experiment with different combinations of segment length values n and threshold values t within a reasonable period of time. With current optimal segment length n value of 9 and optimal threshold t value of 0.8, BLAST-ERTRICO achieved a Q 3 score of 92.19% on the standard test dataset RS126, a 2.26% improvement over our test results in 1 T h i s sugge st s t h at t h i s app r oa c h m a y be e v e n m o r e useful  as a practical secondary structure prediction method in the future R EFERENCES  1  L.

show the similar phenomenon Figure 8 shows the running time of all algorithms with min sup 3 and min conf 0  5 on all context logs From this gure we can see that the running time of BP-Growth BPGrowth-P is dramatically less than BP-Growth-NR GCPM-H and GCPM-H-R on all context logs Summary  by comprehensively analyzing the experimental results for running time we summarize the observations as follows a BP-Growth BP-Growth-P dramatically outperform BPGrowth-NR GCPM-H and GCPM-H-R in terms of running time It implies that the strategy of removing redundant data plays a more important role in reducing the running time for behavior pattern mining than the strategy of data set partition and the improvement for data set partition based algorithms is more dramatic b GCPM-H-R is roughly comparable to GCPM-H in terms of running time It implies that applying the strategy of removing redundant data to an Apriori-like algorithm only leads to very limited improvement of running time c BP-Growth-P is roughly comparable to BP-Growth in terms of running time It implies that the pseudo projection technology only has very limited effect on reducing the running time of BP-Growth VII CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we studied several strategies which may be used for improving the efciency of behavior pattern mining in terms of computing efciency and memory cost To be specic we searched some typical optimizing strategies for association rule mining and discuss the feasibility of applying them to behavior pattern mining since the two problems are similar in many aspects Moreover we proposed a novel and efcient algorithm named BP-Growth for behavior pattern mining by combining two promising strategies The extensive experiments in a practical mobile computing environment clearly show that BP-Growth and its optimization signicantly outperform GCPM and other two baselines which adopt one of the two promising strategies in terms of both running time and memory cost One challenge of utilizing behavior patterns is that there usually exists thousands of behavior patterns for an individual mobile user Usually many of them are semantically similar or related and may be summarized by several representative patterns As for future work we plan to study the effective approaches to summarize lots of behavior patterns for easing the representation of user habits while maintaining as much information as possible VIII A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS The research was supported by grants from Nokia Research Center China Natural Science Foundation of China Grant

Figure 6 is not as signicant as that of 1st largest answers For example in Rule 1 with 1m data size DA  PAP has an improvement about 2200 from 5500 to 3300 in Figure 2 while the corresponding improvement is only about 1500 from 5500 to 4000 in Figure 6 Nevertheless DAP  PAP can still keep the lowest time cost in all the test in Figure 6 VII C ONCLUSIONS Motivated by the utility of differential dependencies  DD s in real applications like violation detection in this paper we study the problem of determining the distance thresholds for metric distance constraints from data Instead of manually specifying requirements of various statistical measures we conduct the determination in a parameter-free style i.e to compute an expected utility of the distance threshold pattern and return the results with the maximum expected utility Several advanced pruning algorithms are then developed in order to efciently nd the desired distance thresholds Finally the experimental evaluation on three real data sets demonstrates the performance of our proposed methods In particular we evaluate the effectiveness of returned results in the violation detection application and show that the pruning techniques can achieve lower time cost A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No 611411 National Grand Fundamental

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresby PCA, number of records by FP-Growth By experiments, found the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
