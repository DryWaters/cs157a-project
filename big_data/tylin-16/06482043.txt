At the other hand, lack of reference data is very often responsible for poor performance of learning where one of the key problems in sup ervised learning is due to the insufficient size of the training dataset. Therefore, we try to suggest a new development a theo retically and practically valid tool for analyzing small of samp le data remains a critical and challenging issue for researches.

No single existing field is capable of satisfying the needs. Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery which utilizes methods, techniqu es, and tools from diverse disciplines, emerged in last d ecade to solve this problem. It brings knowledge and theories from several fields including databases, machine learning, optimization, statistics, and data visualization and has been applied to various real-life applications. Even though data mining has made significant progress during the past fifteen y ears, most research effort is devoted to developing effective and efficient algorithms that can extract knowledge from data and not enough attention has been paid to the philosophical foundations of data mining Knowledge Discovery in Databases \(KDD\e non trivial process of identifying, novel, potentially useful and ultimately understandable patterns in the data   KDD process is an interactive and iterative multi-step process which uses six steps to extract interesting knowledge according to same specific measur es and thresholds, these steps include \(data selection, clearing, enrichment, coding, data mining and reporting  W ill th ese step s are ex tend ed  by t o i n cl ude \( De vel o p i ng, creat i ng, dat a cl eani ng and  preprocessing, data reduction, choosing the data mining task choosing the data mining algorithm\(s\a mining interpreting mined patterns and finally consolidating discovered knowledge Data mining is not just a single method or single technique but rather a spectrum of different approaches which searches of patterns and relationships of data  Data mining is concerned with important aspects related to both database techniques and AI/machine learning mechanisms, and provides an excellent opportunity for exploring the interesting rela tionship between retrieval and inference/reasoning, a fundamental issue concerning the nature of data mining Data mining is becoming more widespread every day because it empowers companies to uncover profitable patterns and trends from their existing databases. Companies and institutions have been spent millions of dollars to collect megabytes and terabytes of data but are not taking advantages of the valuable and actionable information hidden deep within their data repositories. Companies that do not apply these techniques are in danger of falling behind and losing market shares because their competitors are using data mining and are thereby gaining the competitive edge  In this work, we examine the ability to a Random Forest Data Mining algorithm \(RFDM\ to pre-process huge database that suffer from missing values problem.

The first algorithm GEMS\used for ensemble creation, and the second \(GREX\s used for rule extraction from opaque models. The main property of GEMS is the ability to combine smaller ensembles and individual models in an almost arbitrary way Moreover, GEMS can use base models of any kind and the optimization function is very flexible, easily permitting 


inclusion of, for instance, diversity measures. In the experimentation, GEMS obtain ed accuracies higher than both straightforward design choices and published results for Random Forests and AdaBoost. The key quality of G-REX is the inherent ability to exp licitly control the accuracy vs comprehensibility trade-off. Compared to the standard tree inducers C5.0 and CART, and some well-known rule extraction algorithms, rules extracted by G-REX are significantly more accurate and compact. Most importantly, GREX is thoroughly evaluated and found to meet all relevant evaluation criteria for rule extraction algorithms, thus establishing G-REX as the algorithm to benchmark against Samaher H. and Mahdi A., 2007[2 present a methodology for discovering classification rules in data mining using FCM and GP to classify five well known database ANDing and ORing form are used in formulation the classification rules Samaher H 2008 2   present  a m e tho d  t o  desi gn a programming system using hybrid techniques represented by soft computing and data mining to discovery knowledge in databases.

KDD has a long history of applications to data analysis in business military, and social economic activities. While the aim of KDD is to discover the pattern of a data set, the size of the data set closely related to one of analysis methods. The classic approach is using certai n statistical techniques to deal with data sets of more than 30 samples and by dimension reduction to reveal the pattern. With the rapid increase of Internet development and usage, the amount of data has been enormous. The term “Data Warehouse” has been used to describe such quantities of data and the corresponding methodologies for analysis are under the title of “data mining In contrast to the huge amount of data sets, there is another type of data set which is small \(less than 30\but still is significant in terms of socioeconomic cost. Consider severe earthquakes, random terrorist attacks, and nuclear plant explosions; the occurrences of su ch events are relatively few the conventional statistic assumptions cannot be verified and thus the methods fail to apply. The ability to predict such kinds of events remains a challe nge for the researchers. This leads to the necessity of recovering a pattern by constructing data. It is an art and science for intelligent data analysis   IV.T HE D EVELOPMENT S YSTEM  The proposed work handles the different challenges posed by data mining. The main constituents of KDD, at this juncture, include GPDCM, PCA, Ad-boost and two of the fast data mining algorithms \(RF, FP-Growth\. Each of them contributes a distinct a methodology to addressing problems in its domain. This is done in a cooperative, rather than a competitive, manner where this work uses four types of processing. The block diagram of the proposed system shows in figure \(1 A  Handling the Missing values  using Random Forest All dataset suffer from three types of problems  1  Missing values Problem This problem is considering one of the still open problems where some of solutions suggest solving this problem as explain follow  0.1  0.3 0.2  0.5  First Solution:  The simplest solution for this problem is the reduction of the data set and the elimination of all samples with missing values. That is possible when large data sets are available, and missing values occur only in a small percentage of samples  Second Solution: a data miner and domain expert, can examine manually samples that have no values and enter a reasonable, probable, or expect ed value, based on a domain   Figure 1  The Block Diagram of the Proposed System  


experience. This method is straightforward for small numbers of missing values and relatively with the small data sets. But if there is no obvious or plausible value for each case, the miner is introducing noise into the data set by manually generating a value Third Solution: automatic replacement of missing values with some constants 000  Replace all missing values with a single global constant 000  Replace a missing value with its feature mean 000  Replace a missing value with its feature mean for the given class 000  Replace a missing value with the nearest neighborhood from top or bottom  2\ Outliers Problem This problem occurs when one value is different in types of all other values. This problem solve using RF in [3    3\ Uncertainty Problem This problem occurs when one value is out of the attribute range. This problem can be solves by RF in [3  Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. RFs intr oduce a new principle to random splitting. It alters the tree growing process by narrowing its focus during split selection. For example, if the database contains 100 columns usable for prediction, RFs would begin by randomly selection 7 variables and then select the splitter from the list of 7 predictors. Once the data has been split into two subsets the process can be re peated by splitting each of the two subsets partly at random. To split one of the two subsets RFs can select a different set of 7 predictors at random and can use the best of these affect a further split. Although in RFs, the t trees grow we split data using the best splitter available, we first randomly limit the list of available splitters to a small number. This means that the selected splitter is best only in the limited sense of being best in the randomly selected list. Each tree is constructed using the following algorithm  Step1 Let the number of training cases be N and the number of variables in the classifier be M  Step2 We are take the number m of input variables be used to determine the decision at a node of the tree m should be less than M  Step3 Choose training set for this tree by choosing N times with replacement from all N available training cases \(i.e. take a bootstrap sample\ rest of the cases need to estimate the error of the tree, by predicting their classes Step4 For each node of the tree, we choose randomly m  variables based on the decision node. Calculate the best split based on these m variables in the training set Step5 Each tree become fully grown and not pruned as can be done in constructing a normal tree classifier All the prior models tend to combine more effectively into high performance aggregate models. While RFs is different in that it introduces an entirely new way of generating individual component models and do not combine more effectively into high performance aggregate mode ls. There are two reasons for this First combining or averaging the models does not accomplish significant accuracy im provement, if the individual models are too similar to each other. the RFs have two-part randomization process makes the individual models quite different from each other Second the other models is slow learning while in RFs becau se the trees are grown independently of each other with no single tree depending on any other tree for its generation, adding trees does not create a risk of overfitting. RFs can be expanded indefinitely without a loss in performance. If an important pattern genuinely exists in the data portions, it will be uncovered by different trees and genuine patterns will be detected repeatedly by different trees As a result, the work add the following idea mapping among all the weight values  of the record has the missing values with all  features of the record has a weight values similar of that record, the mapping perform at the down level of splitter to reduce the time and number of comparing among the weight of features. This method can find the actual values of the missing values, and handle the uncertainty and outliers problems    Figure2..Example of Handling Missing Values using RF 


V  G ENETIC P ROGRAMMING D ATA C ONSTRUCTION M ETHOD GPDCM The lack of reference data is very often cause a poor performance of learning. Therefore, How to develop a theoretically and practically valid tool for analyzing small sample data remains a critical and challenging issue for researches and it consider being one of the still open problems Data construction methods can be roughly divided into two groups, according to c onstruction strategy hypothesis-driven methods and data-driven methods  Hypothesis-driven methods construct new attributes out of previously-generated hypotheses \(discovered rules or another kind of knowledge representation\general they start by constructing a hypothesis, for instance a decision tree, and then examine that hypothesis to construct new attribut  By contrast data-driven methods do not suffer from the problem of depending on the quality of previous hypotheses. They construct new attributes by dir ectly detecting relationships in the data The process of attribute construction can also be roughly divided into two approaches, namely the interleaving approach and the preprocessing approach  In the preprocessing approach the process of attribute construction is independent of the inductive learning algorithm that will be used to extract knowledge from the data. In other words, the quality of a candidate new attribute is evaluated by directly accessing the data, without running any inductive learning algorithm. In this approach the attribute construction method performs a preprocessing of the data, and the new constructed attributes can be given to different kinds of inductive learning methods By contrast in the interleaving approach the process of attribute construction is intertwined with the inductive learning algorithm. The quality of a candidate new attribute is evaluated by running the inductive learning algorithm used to extract knowledge from the data, so that in principle the constructed attributes’ usefulness tends to be limited to that inductive learning algorithm. An example of data construction method following the interleaving approach can be found in [3  In this work we follow the data-driven strategy and the preprocessing approach, mainly for two reasons First using this combination of strategy/approach the constructed data have a more generic usefulness, since they can help to improve the predictive accuracy of any kind of inductive learning algorithm Second data construction method following the preprocessing approach tends to be more efficient than its interleaving counterpart, since the latter requires many executions of an induc tive learning algorithm The work proposes a GPDC M to create more visual samples the original small dataset; the idea is depend on the represent each individual as d ecision tree. After that, we use tournament selection and apply the genetic operations reproduction, crossover and mutation\here are three types of crossover operations each one of them give different result therefore the work focuses on the following types A. The Node Crossover The following, steps can be represented the implementation of the node crossover method Step1 Select two parents from population Step2 Select random one crossover node from the first parent and search randomly in the second parent for an exchangeable Step3 Swap the crossover node Step4 The child is a copy of the modified its first parent  B. The Branch Crossover The following, steps can be re presented the implementation branch crossover method Step1 Select two parents from population Step2 Select random one crossover node from the first parent and search randomly in the second parent for an exchangeable Step3 Cutoff the branch with the crossover nodes Step4 Calculate the size of the expected child \(remind size of first parent + size of branch cutoff from the second parent Step5 If the size of child is accepted created the child by appending the prang cutoff from second parent t o the ramming of first parent otherwise try again starting from STEP 2  C. The Mixed Crossover The following, steps can be re presented the implementation mixed crossover method Step1 Select two parents from population Step2 Select random one crossover node a terminal node in the second parent St e p3 Generate the child by replacing the branch with the crossover node in first parent with the terminal node select from second parent The fitness function used in this work is information gain ratio [Fre02 wh ich is a well-kno wn attribu t e-quality  measure in the data mining and machine learning literature. It should be noted that the use of this measure constitutes a data-driven strategy. As we mentioned above, an important advantage of this kind of strategy is that it is relatively fast since it avoids the need for running a data mining algorithm when evaluating an attribute \(individual\ In particular, the information gain ratio for a given attribute can be computed in a single scan of the training set As a result, if the population consist of 20 individuals \(No of records in database or No of parents\each crossover between two parents yields one child this mean generation 10 children when apply node crossover, 10 children when apply branch crossover, 10 children when apply mixed crossover at first iteration of GPDCM The size of new population =the size of old population No of children for all the three crossover approaches  The size of new population=20 +30=50 individuals. While the 


size of population in second iteration =50+75=125 individuals. See figure 3   Figure3. Block Diagram of the GPDCM  Each individual generation by any crossover method is tested if it is valid or not by given the value, where\(-1\or each operation and \(+1\oper and and find the summation of these values if the result is +1 the expression is valid otherwise is not valid. The generation process is continues, until it depends on the value of the statis tical measures such as mean standard deviations and Roc Curve analysis  VI  D IMENSION R EDUCTION USING P RINCIPAL COMPONENTS ANALYSIS  The use of too many predictor variables to model a relationship with a response variable can unnecessarily complicate the interpretation of the analysis and violates the principle of parsimony: that one should consider keeping the number of predictors to a size that could easily be interpreted Also, retaining too many variables may lead to overfitting, in which the generality of the findi ngs is hindered because the new data do not behave the same as the training data for all the variables Further, analysis solely at the variable level might miss the fundamental underlying relationships among predictors. For example, several predictors might fall naturally into a single group \(a factor or a component ses a single aspect of the data   Dimension reduction methods have the goal of using the correlation structure among the predictor variables to accomplish the following A  To reduce the number of predictor components B  To help ensure that these components are independent C  To provide a framework for interpretability of the results   Definition  1 Principal components analysis \(PCA to explain the correlation structure of a set of predictor variables using a smaller set of linear combinations of these variables. These linear combinations are called components   Suppose that the original variables X 1 X 2 Xm form a coordinate system in m dimensional space. The principal components represent a new coordinate system, found by rotating the original system along the directions of maximum variability. When preparing to perform data reduction, the analyst should first standardize the data so that the mean for each variable is zero and the standard deviation is 1. Let each variable Xi represent an n 1 vector, where n is the number of records. Then represent the st andardized variable as the n 1 vector Zi where Zi  Xi 000  002\035 i   0011 ii  002\035 i is the mean of Xi and 0011 ii is the standard deviation of Xi In matrix notation,this standardization is expressed as Z  V 1  2 000 1 X 000  002\035   w here the 1” e xponent refers to the matrix inverse, and V 1  2 is a diagonal matrix \(nonzero entries only on the diagonal\, the m  m standard deviation matrix   Let 000 refer to the symmetric covariance matrix    Where i 000  j refers to the covariance between Xi and X j      The covariance is a measure of the degree to which two variables vary together. Positive covariance indicates that when one variable increases, the other tends to increase. Negative covariance indicates that when one variable increases, the other tends to decrease Note that the covariance meas ure is not scaled, so that changing the units of measure would change the value of the covariance The correlation coefficient ri j avoids this difficulty by scaling the covariance by each of the standard deviations    Then the correlation matrix is denoted as 002    


H OW CAN YOU COMPUTE PCA In order to compute the PCA we can follow the following  Step1 Compute the  standardized data matrix Z  Z 1 Z 2  Zm  ba se on  Zi  Xi 000  002\035 i   0011 ii from the original dataset Step2 Compute  Eigenvalues. Let B be an m  m matrix, and let I be the m  m identity matrix \(diagonal matrix with 1’s on the diagonal\. Then the scalars \(numbers of dimension 1 × 1 002\034 1  002\034 1  002\034 m are said to be the Eigenvalues of B if they satisfy B 000  002\034 I 0  Step3 Compute Eigenvectors. Let B be an m  m matrix, and let 002\034  be an Eigenvalues of B Then nonzero m 1 vector e is said to be an eigenvector of B if Be  002\034 e   Step4 The i th principal component of the standardized data matrix Z  Z 1 Z 2   Zm  i s  gi ve n by  Yi  e T i Z  where e i refers to the i th eigenvector discussed below\ and e T i refers to the transpose of e i The principal comp onents are linear combinations Y 1 Y 2 Yk of the standardized variables in Z such that \(1 variances of the Yi are as large as possible and \(2\e Yi are uncorrelated. The first principal component is the linear combination Y 1 e T 1 Z  e 11 Z 1 e 12 Z 2 e 1 m Zm which has greater variability than any other possible linear combination of the Z variables. Thus  000  The first principal component is the linear combination Y 1 e T 1Z, which maximizesVar Y 1 e T 1 002 e 1 000  The second principal component is the linear combination Y 2 e T 2Z, which is  independent of Y 1 and maximizes Var Y 2 e T 2 002 e 2 000  The i th principal component is the linear combination Yi  e _ i X which is independent  of all the other principal components Yj , j < i and maximizes Var Yi  e T i 002 e i  The criteria used for deciding how many components to extract are the following 000  Eigenvalue criterion 000  Proportion of variance explained criterion 000  Minimum communality criterion 000  Scree plot criterion The eigenvalue criterion states that each component should explain at least one variable’s worth of the variability, and therefore the eigenvalue criterion states that only components with eigenvalues greater than 1 should be retained. For the proportion of variance explained criterion, the analyst simply selects the components one by one until the desired proportion of variability explained is attained. The minimum communality criterion states that enough components should be extracted so that the communalities for each of these variables exceed a certain threshold \(e.g., 50%\e scree plot criterion is this The maximum number of components that should be extracted is just prior to where the plot begins to straighten out into a horizontal line  VII  FP-G ROWTH A LGORITHM   After, we get the best features for database base on PCA i.e., reduce number of features\We using FP-Growth algorithm to discovering frequency item sets and  generation all association rules of that database  FP-Growth  adopts a divide and conquer strategy by \(1 compressing the database representing frequent items into a structure called FP-tree \(frequent pattern tree\at retains all the essential information and \(2\ dividing the compressed database into a set of conditional databases, each associated with one frequent itemset and mining each one separately. It scans the database only twice. In the first scan, all the frequent items and their support counts \(frequencies\ are derived and they are sorted in th e order of descending support count in each transaction. In the second scan, items in each transaction are merged into an FP-tree and items \(nodes\hat appear in common in different transactions are counted. Each node is associated with an item and its count Nodes with the same label are linked by a pointer called a node-link. Since items are sorted in the descending order of frequency, nodes closer to the r oot of the FP tree are shared by more transactions, thus resulting in a very compact representation that stores all th e necessary information. Pattern growth algorithm works on FP-tree by choosing an item in the order of increasing frequency and extracting frequent itemsets that contain the chosen item by recursively calling itself on the conditional FP-tree, that is, FP-tree conditioned to the chosen item. FP-growth is an order of magnitude faster than the original Apriori algorithm  VIII  C LASSIFICATION BASE ON A SSOCIATION R ULES   After that, adboosting data mining algorithm used to find best class for the association ru les ,result from FP-Growth \(i.e find the class base on volt principle\low Step1 initialize equal weights for all N rules in association rule database \(ARD\w = {wj = 1/N | j = 1, 2,. . . , N Step2 set number of iteration equal K Step3 for i=1 to K do Step4 Great training set Di by sampling \(with replacement from \(ARD\cording to w STEP 5 Train a base classifier Ci on Di Step 6 Apply Ci to all rules in the original training set, D Step 7 Calculate the weighted error   Step 8 If 0.5 then Step 9 Reset the weights for all N rules: w = {wj = 1/N | j 1, 2, . . . ,N}: Go back to Step 4 STEP 10 end if

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of features”by PCA”, number of records” by FP-Growth By experiments, found “the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth”, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
