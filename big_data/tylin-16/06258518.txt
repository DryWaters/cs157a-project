 Helsinki Institute for Information Technology HIIT PO Box 19800 FI-00076 Aalto University Finland firstname.lastname@hiit.fi Abstract We present Ma$$iv e  an intelligent mobile grocery assistant that provides support for the customer during the entire shopping process To guide the design of Ma$$iv e  we conducted a user study that explored customer preferences regarding features in a mobile grocery aid We rst describe the study and its results after which we introduce the design principles and design of Ma$$iv e  We also describe the features that Ma$$iv e 
supports and discuss functionalities that we are integrating into Ma$$iv e  As part of the discussion we describe technical challenges that we have encountered during our development efforts I I NTRODUCTION Grocery shopping is one of the most fundamental everyday activities as almost everyone shops for groceries on a regular and frequent basis The fundamental nature of grocery shopping combined with large business potential makes it an interesting domain for developing and deploying novel pervasive and mobile computing technologies Grocery shopping is a relatively complex and stressful activity The complexity and stressfulness arise from diverse sources such as time and budget constraints crowding adver 
tisements and the behaviour of other customers T o reduce stress and to make the shopping experience smoother most customers plan the shopping activity both before going to a store and while inside it Perv asi v e and mobile technologies can reduce the complexity and stressfulness by facilitating planning and supporting dynamic adaptation of plans during the shopping activity For most customers planning the shopping event involves creating either a written or a mental shopping list Consumer studies have shown that between 50 and 75 of customers create a written shopping list for major shopping visits and the majority of the remaining customers create a mental shopping list Shopping lists ha v e numerous functions 
Among other things they are used as external memory aids as a tool for budgeting and as a way to efìciently organize the visit to the store In terms of design the central role of shopping lists implies that pervasive and mobile technologies for retailing should support the use of shopping lists and practices surrounding their use However it is also important to note that shopping lists are not rigid plans that determine how the shopping event unfolds In fact customers typically purchase two to three times more items than what are included on their shopping lists Accordingly  retailing also pro vides opportunities for facilitating the exploration of alternatives and for helping to nd potentially relevant and interesting items Grocery shopping is closely linked with social functions and 
roles For example studies in western countries have indicated that wives tend to contribute more to shopping lists than husbands Ho we v er  within f amilies shopping lists are typically created collaboratively and most family members contribute to the process Perv asi v e and mobile technologies for retailing should not undermine family roles and they should support existing collaborative processes among the family members In this paper we present Ma$$iv e  an intelligent mobile grocery assistant that focuses on supporting customers during all stages of the grocery shopping process To support prevailing shopping practices Ma$$iv e has been designed around a shopping list paradigm where customers create 
shopping lists using free-form natural language Ma$$iv e has been constructed in collaboration with a large Finnish supermarket that has been instrumented with additional WiFi access points to enable positioning and from which we have received anonymized shopping basket data to support personalization To determine which functionalities to include in Ma$$iv e  we conducted a survey study in a large national supermarket in which we explored customer preferences for potential features in a mobile grocery aid We describe the study and its results in Sec III after which Sec IV describe the design and current features of Ma$$iv e  We also describe some functionalities that we are currently working on and 
discuss technical challenges that we have encountered during our development efforts II R ELATED W ORK The design of grocery aids can beneìt from investigations of shopping practices Newcomb et al conducted in-store interviews and questionnaires that studied customers shopping habits and attitudes towards ubiquitous retail solutions The authors found that shopping lists play a central role in grocery shopping and that customers prefer grocery aids they can use on their personal devices Features that facilitate shopping list creation and management were considered to be the most important Customers also valued systems that help them locate products with aisle-level accuracy provide itemized

pricing and inform about special offers Features that provide product or health information were considered least important Tamura et al used participatory observ ation combined with pre and post interviews to analyze customers shopping behavior in Japan Their study indicated that grocery shopping consisted of three phases each of which has a speciìc pattern The three phases correspond to selecting items for the main dish the side dish and replenishing items that are lacking from home However these ndings are of limited use in our setting as the Japanese shopping and eating habits differ signiìcantly from those in western countries A focus group study by Roussos and Moussouri indicated a need to carefully design systems that gather and analyze customers shopping data in order not to raise concerns about the loss of privacy The study also revealed that participants feared that automatically generated shopping lists could have a negative effect on the everyday household routines and responsibilities within the family unit A number of prototypes of pervasive shopping aids for supporting grocery shopping have been proposed in the literature These range from instrumented shopping carts to applications that run on a PDA or a mobile phone An example of the former is the MyGrocer system which uses RFID-based product identiìcation to monitor which products the customer has selected and provides special offers and information about the total price of the current shopping basket Other examples of instrumented shopping carts include 12 An example of the latter is the Easi-Order system which has a list-based personalized recommendation system letting the users place grocery orders remotely and fetch them later on from the supermarket Recommendations ha v e also been considered in other systems For example Lawrence et al mak e recommendations by matching the customer with a cluster of similar shoppers The iGrocer system on the other hand adapts its recommendations based on the customerês purchase history and preferences selected from a menu Another common feature has been a map that can guide customers to the products of interest usually listed in a digital shopping list In addition to perv asi v e shopping aids that support grocery shopping various pervasive shopping aids that focus on malls or other retail domains have been proposed in the literature see e.g  Ma$$iv e  the system presented in this paper offers features that have not been considered in previous shopping aids First in Ma$$iv e  shopping lists are created using natural language and recommendations are based on the userês current shopping list entries instead of relying on the customerês purchase history To avoid undermining family roles the recommendations in Ma$$iv e focus on facilitating the exploration of products instead of automating tasks Secondly Ma$$iv e combines recommendation techniques with positioning to enable locationaware information delivery III E XPLORATION OF U SER N EEDS To guide our design we have conducted a survey study that investigated which features customers consider important in a grocery aid running on the customerês mobile phone and how demographic variables or shopping habits inîuence these preferences The study was conducted within a large supermarket reaching 45 responses The survey design was informed by an earlier study by Newcomb et al which also investigated shopping habits and preferences regarding features in a mobile grocery aid However whereas Newcomb et al analyzed shopping habits and customer preferences separately as part of our study we also investigated how demographic factors affect the customers preferences for grocery aid features A Questionnaire The questionnaire that was used in the study consisted of two parts The rst part surveyed participant demographics age gender grocery shopping frequency number of people in the household ownership of a customer loyalty card for the target supermarket chain mobile phone ownership and its use for text messaging and note-taking and the medium paper mental electronic of shopping lists The second part of the questionnaire consisted of a list of potential features for a mobile shopping assistant The participants were asked to rate the importance of each feature on a seven-point Likert scale 1  not at all useful 7=very useful To compile the list of features we conducted a literature review to identify features that have been part of existing shopping assistants Only features that could be implemented on contemporary mobile phones without additional hardware were included in the questionnaire The literature review resulted in twelve features and ve additional features were included after an internal brainstorming session see Table I the features that were considered The survey was carried out within a large national supermarket Potential respondents were approached inside the store and asked to ll in the questionnaire in paper form 2 pages Participants were rewarded with coffee and cake for their participation The responses were collected during a four hour interval around lunch time on two consecutive weekdays In total we collected 45 valid responses The participants ranged in age from 18 to 84 years  mean  47  002 18  and were of an almost equal number of males  24  53  and females  21  47  Before analysis we clustered the participants into age groups of approximately the same number of participants With the exception of the oldest participant everyone owned a mobile phone 31 of the participants used their phones for tasks other than voice calls and text messages Only one participant had used his mobile phone camera while shopping 31 of the participants rarely typed on their mobile phones 20 typed 1Ö4 times a week and 49 typed more often 31 of the participants had children and 82 had the supermarketês customer loyalty card The results indicated that customers shop frequently for groceries 91 of the participants said they shop for groceries at least twice a week 71 said they shopped at least three times a week and 51 shopped at least four times a week Most participants used some form of shopping list to support

their shopping activities Speciìcally 89 of the participants said they used some form of shopping lists to support their grocery shopping activities 71 of the participants used written shopping lists and 78 of the participants used mental shopping lists Accordingly only few participants relied exclusively on one type of shopping lists B Importance of Shopping Assistant Features The responses are presented in Table I in the order of their mean ratings They indicate a clustering of features into three groups features that facilitate budgeting and time usage features that facilitate basic shopping tasks and supplementary features The ranking of feature groups was stable i.e the features importance ranks varied solely within the three feature groups and not across them The only exception to this rule was the automatic checkout feature the rank of which was different in different age groups Participants aged between 18 and 25 considered automatic checkout mean 6  86  more important than other participants mean of other age groups combined 3  73  003 2=16  49 p 01 1  Participants considered features that facilitate budgeting and time usage most important Female participants were more interested in price-related features than their male counterparts as both product price information  003 2=7  99 p 01  and special offers  003 2=6  01 p   05  were considered more important by females mean 6  44 and 6  28  than by males mean 5  05 and 4  80  The possibility to compare prices of similar products within a store was considered more important by participants with no children mean 5  24  than by those with children mean 3  92  003 2=3  98 p 05  Features that facilitate basic shopping tasks such as nding products or recipes paying or examining product information were considered the second most important feature group The possibility to create a shopping list was generally perceived as important whereas responses to other features within this category contained more variation First as noted above we found the age group of the participants to inîuence their preferences regarding automatic checkout Second product information  003 2=9  31 p   01  and shopping basket health information  003 2=6  62 p   05  were considered less important by participants with children mean 2  54 and 3  00  than by those without children mean 4  36 and 4  80  Supplementary features i.e features 14Ö17 in Table I were considered least important Participants aged between 18 and 25 were more interested in supplementary features than other participants Especially recipe recommendations were considered more important by this age group mean 4  29  than by other age groups mean of other age groups combined 2  63  003 2=10  24 p   05  Participants over 65 years old were most critical towards supplementary features Especially recipe related features were not consider important by them mean rating 1  14 for both recipe recommendations and recipe search Participants with children mean 1  92  found product 1 The signiìcance tests have been carried out using Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance where we have adjusted the ranks for ties recommendations less useful than participants with no children mean 3  60  003 2=6  88 p 01  Thus interestingly only the participantês age gender or whether the participant had children were found to have a statistically signiìcant inîuence on the customers preferences In addition we found no evidence that the customerês familiarity with mobile technology would inîuence the preferences C Design implications The results indicate a strong preference for price-related information Presenting exact product price information is not in the business interests of retailers as it could improve customers price knowledge thus enabling them to better compare prices across different stores However there are other ways to support price consciousness e.g by making special offers prominently visible or by providing recommendations of items that have attractive prices In the second feature category the dominant aspect is the large variance of the respondents evaluations This implies that the practices of individual customers vary and call for different functionalities In our design we have prioritized a small set of core features that the majority of respondents found important However to cater for differing individual practices we have also provided users easy access to a wide variety of supplementary features The preferences for the supplementary features depend to some extent on demographic variables whereas the preferences for the core features were generally stable across all demographics  Similarly to consumer studies on shopping list usage our survey indicated that a large proportion of customers use shopping lists Motivated by this nding we have designed our shopping assistant around a shopping list paradigm where the shopping list serves as an entry point for users to access different resources that help them to carry out their everyday shopping practices IV M A  IV e This section describes the design and implementation of Ma$$iv e  our intelligent mobile grocery assistant We present the current features of Ma$$iv e  summarizing results from a number of studies that we have conducted during the design process We also describe some of the features we are currently working on A Architecture Ma$$iv e has been implemented following a client-server architecture see Fig 1 The main application logic resides on a remote server that is also responsible for storing all user data In addition the server hosts a product database anonymized shopping basket data and association rules that are used to make recommendations Storing all user data on the remote server makes it possible to share shopping lists and to access the same shopping list both on PCs and on mobile devices We have implemented two versions of the Ma$$iv e client The rst client is web-based and can be accessed using the web browser on a mobile device or a PC whereas the second

up We have planned for six views shopping list available shopping lists special offers navigation recipe search and camera mode Currently only the four rst views have been implemented The available shopping lists view allows users to change the currently active shopping list and to share shopping lists with other users The special offers view provides a list of currently available special offers Finally in the navigation view the customer can locate products and obtain navigation instructions to that location from his/her current location within the store The planned interface for the camera mode would enable the user to take a picture of a shelf of interest after which relevant information such as recommendations or information about relevant special offers would be provided to the user The recipe recommendations view on the other hand would work similarly to the special offers view and provide recommendations about relevant recipes based on the natural language items on the customerês shopping list C Natural Language Interaction Existing shopping assistants typically require that customers create shopping lists either by referring to speciìc products or by selecting items from a predeìned taxonomy Actual shopping lists on the other hand contain a mixture of generic item names e.g milk or coffee speciìc products and personally meaningful expressions such as something good Instead of requiring customers to create shopping lists using predeìned vocabularies Ma$$iv e enables creating shopping lists using natural language Stores typically refer to speciìc products instead of generic item names which means there is a semantic gap between the userês shopping list entries and the information contained by the store To bridge this gap we have developed a grocery retrieval engine that takes a natural language entry e.g milk as input and returns a ranked list of candidate products that match the query The engine uses a ranking formula that combines textual features i.e product name and category name with product popularity information i.e how often the product has been purchased User evaluations have indicated that our retrieval engine can determine relevant products for approximately 80 of shopping list entries 21 Currently the retrieval engine is not directly integrated as part of the interface but it acts as a background service that assists other functionalities Entering shopping list items using a mobile device is often slow and cumbersome due to the limited input capabilities of mobile devices To facilitate shopping list creation Ma$$iv e incorporates a novel predictive text input technique that uses dictionary frequencies together with association rules to suggest relevant items The use of association rules makes it possible to capture correlations between different shopping list items For example if the userês shopping list contains ice cream  the item chocolate sauce would be ranked higher due to the strong correlation between the two items We have evaluated our predictive text input technique in a user study The results of the study indicate that our method increases user satisfaction reduces the amount of errors and makes text input faster The predicti v e te xt input technique is used in the shopping list view as the default text input method when customers enter new grocery items Currently pen and paper are the dominant way to create shopping lists since they provide an easy fast and convenient way to enter items Paper-form shopping lists can also be placed in a prominent location within a home which enables collaborative list creation among family members To this end even if we are able to facilitate shopping list creation on mobile devices it is unlikely that customers would be willing to change their existing practices and to start using Ma$$iv e simply because of its shopping list capabilities To motivate customers to use Ma$$iv e for creating their shopping list we should provide added value As an example of an additional feature we have developed a grocery product recommender that operates on individual shopping list items and recommends potentially interesting products The recommendations are generated using a three-phase process First we use our grocery retrieval engine to map the items on the customerês shopping list into potential products Next we take the top ve retrieval results and use generalized association rules to generate recommendations for each result item Finally we re-rank the recommendations taking into consideration the goodness of the retrieval result and the goodness of the recommendation We have evaluated our recommendation technique in a user study The results indicate that most of the times our method is able to generate recommendations that customers consider interesting see for more details about our recommendation technique and the user evaluation The recommender has been integrated as part of the shopping list view Recommendations for a particular shopping list item can be examined by clicking on a more button next to the corresponding item see Fig 2 The exploratory study on user needs described in Sec III indicated that customers are highly interested in obtaining information about special offers on their mobile device Major retail chains typically provide promotions for numerous products at a given time which makes it challenging to identify the most interesting and relevant special offers on a mobile device To address this challenge as another additional feature we have developed an algorithm that determines the relevance of available special offers based on the contents of the customerês shopping list The algorithm is currently used in the special offer view of Ma$$iv e to provide a personalized ranking of the currently available special offers Our technique rst uses the natural language retrieval engine described above to map items on the customerês shopping list to product categories Next association rule based recommendations are used to identify potentially relevant purchase categories that are missing from the participantês shopping list A statistical interest measure is then used to assign a rank score for each of the categories that either the retrieval engine or the recommender system returned The resulting rank scores of the categories can then be used to determine a personalized ranking of special offers for each customer We have conducted preliminary user evaluations with the algorithm which

90 PERCENTILE  OF THE INDOOR POSITIONING ENGINE  IN METERS  UNDER DIFFERENT CROWDING CONDITIONS AND TAG SCANNING INTERVALS  IN SECONDS  demonstrate that our technique identiìes special offers that customers consider relevant and interesting Moreover the results of these preliminary evaluation indicate that the use of a recommender system to identify potentially missing product categories signiìcantly improves the algorithm D Indoor Positioning To enable location-based features we have integrated support for indoor positioning into Ma$$iv e  The positioning is based on a commercial WiFi engine provided by Ekahau 2  The positioning is available only within our partner supermarket where we have deployed 29 wireless access points The positioning requires users to carry WiFi tags that periodically scan the wireless signal environment and send ngerprints that contain information about available access points and signal strengths to a positioning server that estimates the userês position The tag scanning interval can be conìgured between 0  2 and 10 seconds Higher scanning frequencies result in better positioning accuracy but also deplete the batteries of the tags faster We have evaluated the accuracy of the positioning engine in our partner supermarket under different crowding conditions and using different tag scanning intervals We considered three crowding conditions i an empty shop ii rush hour and iii shelf replenishment during which roller cages and crates disturb wireless signals in the store In the evaluation we considered four different scanning intervals 0.2 0.5 1.0 and 2.0 seconds The results of the evaluation are shown in Table II The table shows the median and 90 percentile accuracies for the different conditions The average error of the positioning is roughly two meters and most of the time the estimates are within ve meters of the userês actual position This level of accuracy is well-suited for services such as navigation or location-based advertisements However the accuracy is not sufìcient for pinpointing item positions exactly or for constructing mobile augmented reality solutions Getting the positioning to work within a supermarket environment has proved challenging In terms of ngerprinting the challenge arises from the structure of the environment as supermarkets contain a mixture of open spaces where signals can propagate freely and aisles that block signals Other challenges are related to multi-path effects that are caused by the metallic shelves and to the varying number of people 2 http://www.ekahau.com inside the store The human body consists mostly of water which blocks wireless signals This makes calibration of the positioning engine difìcult as signal measurements must be collected at different times of day and under different crowding conditions To mitigate the inaccuracies described above we currently utilize a grid-based location model where we have divided the oor plan of the retail environment into 103 grid cells see Fig 3 In the construction of the grid we ensured that each aisle was divided into three cells and that there are grid cells located at both ends of an aisle This grid structure helps us to distinguish when the user is navigating within an aisle or moving from one aisle to another As part of the grid structure we store information about each cellês extended neighborhood  which consists of the direct and shelf neighbors The direct neighbors of a cell are deìned as those cells that have at least one border in common with the cell i.e spatially adjacent grid cells whereas the shelf neighbors correspond to cells that are not spatially adjacent but that are situated in neighboring aisles For example the direct neighbors of grid cell 12 are 13 and 14  and its shelf neighbors are 8 and 18  The measured position can sometimes stray to the wrong end of the aisle or to the neighboring one By conìguring a cell neighborhood we are able to alleviate some of the positioning inaccuracies by replacing a target grid cell with its neighborhood Abstracting the position using a grid structure also signiìcantly facilitates management of product location information and we have currently mapped 15  000 products into corresponding grid cells This was accomplished using a web-based tool that allowed associating product categories with the grid cells While this effort is feasible for individual supermarkets a full exploitation of positioning within a supermarket chain all the shops would require extensive resources due to individual shop designs and product layouts E Location-Based Services Our recent work has focused on integrating the positioning and the natural language interaction techniques described previously As an example of this work we have developed MONSTRE an indoor na vigation system that assists customers in nding products within the store The navigation view of Ma$$iv e has been implemented using MONSTRE MONSTRE takes as input a natural language query which can be either one of the items on the customersês shopping list or any additional product The system uses the retrieval engine described in Sec IV-C to map the query into a product category and the mapping of products described in Sec IV-D is then used to determine the location of the product that the customer is searching for The indoor positioning engine is then used to determine the current location of the customer after which the shortest path between the current location and the location of the product is identiìed To determine the shortest path we consider the grid layout as a weighted graph where the vertexes correspond to grid cells and there is an edge between two vertexes whenever the corresponding grid cells are spatially adjacent As the weights of the edges

Fig 3 The grid structure used in the supermarket environment we use the real world distance between the centers of the corresponding grid cells The shortest path is then determined using Dijkstraês algorithm MONSTRE determines when to present new navigation instructions to the user by mapping the shortest path into a motion trajectory where each grid cell has been reduced to its center coordinates The coordinates are then processed sequentially and we calculate the angle 004 between two successive line segments i.e straight lines joining two successive coordinates We consider a cell a turning point whenever the angle 004 between two successive line segments exceeds a predeìned threshold 004 Th  Currently we use 004 Th 45 002  After analyzing the path and determining the turn points we divide the path into a number of overlapping segments Each of the two end points of a segment is either the starting grid cell the destination grid cell or a turn point While the user is moving along the path her current location is monitored and segment speciìc instructions are generated Speciìcally when entering a segment a new instruction is presented that steers the user towards the end point of that segment Furthermore if the length of the segment is long enough an intermediate instruction is also presented to help the user to stay on the correct path In our current implementation an intermediate instruction is played only if the length of a segment is at least ve grid cells To minimize the inîuence of positioning inaccuracies the instructions are presented when the estimated location of the user is within the extended neighborhood of the target grid cell The performance of MONSTRE has been evaluated in a user study with 20 participants In the study participants were given different navigation tasks and we measured the number of navigation errors and the cognitive load of the participants The results indicate that MONSTRE facilitates nding products from the store despite the challenging environment while at the same time imposing a small cognitive load on the participants see for more details W e ha v e also used MONSTRE to conduct a study that explored how different types of navigation instructions affect the attention that cusFig 4 Navigation support in Ma$$iv e  tomers pay to the supermarket environment In the study we considered two types of landmark instructions that differed in terms of their visual demand The rst type of instructions sign-based  used salient signage within the supermarket as landmarks whereas the other type of instructions productbased  used salient product-categories as the landmarks As the product categories were located within the aisles the landmarks forced the participants to actively scan the environment for the landmarks However results from the study revealed that in both conditions customers paid little attention to their surroundings Consequently  a major challenge in pro viding navigation support within supermarket environment is how to assist the customer in a way that is commercially feasible i.e not only enables customers to nd products efìciently but also ensures customers are susceptible to advertising and impulse purchases within the store environment This aspect is one of the main topics in our current research In addition to navigation we have also integrated our algorithm for identifying special offers with the indoor positioning to provide personalized and location-aware advertisements within the supermarket environment Results from a prelimi

nary study suggest that the algorithm is able to increase sales and to lead to additional impulse purchases V S UMMARY AND F UTURE W ORK This paper described the design and current status of Ma$$iv e  an intelligent mobile assistant for enhancing customerês grocery shopping experience The design of Ma$$iv e has been informed by a survey study that we conducted in a large national supermarket The current features of Ma$$iv e include support for natural language shopping lists predictive text input product search product recommendations and indoor positioning We are currently developing new functionalities as well as extending and augmenting the current functionalities First in terms of natural language interaction we are exploring how to make recipe recommendations based on the userês shopping list entries Second the results of the survey indicated that users are relatively interested in product level information One-dimensional bar codes are currently the standard way to identify grocery products and it seems unlikely that other technologies would become commonplace in the near future Mobile phone cameras have been successfully used to read one-dimensional bar codes in laboratory settings However recognizing bar codes that are small or printed on reîecting metallic surfaces is difìcult and alternative solutions for product recognition need to be investigated Instead of attempting to recognize individual products we are currently exploring the combination of computer vision and positioning for recognizing product categories by taking pictures of the shelfs of interest We also exploring the integration of WiFi positioning with pedestrian dead reckoning to improve the accuracy of the indoor positioning A CKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was supported by the Finnish

show the similar phenomenon Figure 8 shows the running time of all algorithms with min sup 3 and min conf 0  5 on all context logs From this gure we can see that the running time of BP-Growth BPGrowth-P is dramatically less than BP-Growth-NR GCPM-H and GCPM-H-R on all context logs Summary  by comprehensively analyzing the experimental results for running time we summarize the observations as follows a BP-Growth BP-Growth-P dramatically outperform BPGrowth-NR GCPM-H and GCPM-H-R in terms of running time It implies that the strategy of removing redundant data plays a more important role in reducing the running time for behavior pattern mining than the strategy of data set partition and the improvement for data set partition based algorithms is more dramatic b GCPM-H-R is roughly comparable to GCPM-H in terms of running time It implies that applying the strategy of removing redundant data to an Apriori-like algorithm only leads to very limited improvement of running time c BP-Growth-P is roughly comparable to BP-Growth in terms of running time It implies that the pseudo projection technology only has very limited effect on reducing the running time of BP-Growth VII CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we studied several strategies which may be used for improving the efìciency of behavior pattern mining in terms of computing efìciency and memory cost To be speciìc we searched some typical optimizing strategies for association rule mining and discuss the feasibility of applying them to behavior pattern mining since the two problems are similar in many aspects Moreover we proposed a novel and efìcient algorithm named BP-Growth for behavior pattern mining by combining two promising strategies The extensive experiments in a practical mobile computing environment clearly show that BP-Growth and its optimization signiìcantly outperform GCPM and other two baselines which adopt one of the two promising strategies in terms of both running time and memory cost One challenge of utilizing behavior patterns is that there usually exists thousands of behavior patterns for an individual mobile user Usually many of them are semantically similar or related and may be summarized by several representative patterns As for future work we plan to study the effective approaches to summarize lots of behavior patterns for easing the representation of user habits while maintaining as much information as possible VIII A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS The research was supported by grants from Nokia Research Center China Natural Science Foundation of China Grant

Figure 6 is not as signiìcant as that of 1st largest answers For example in Rule 1 with 1m data size DA  PAP has an improvement about 2200 from 5500 to 3300 in Figure 2 while the corresponding improvement is only about 1500 from 5500 to 4000 in Figure 6 Nevertheless DAP  PAP can still keep the lowest time cost in all the test in Figure 6 VII C ONCLUSIONS Motivated by the utility of differential dependencies  DD s in real applications like violation detection in this paper we study the problem of determining the distance thresholds for metric distance constraints from data Instead of manually specifying requirements of various statistical measures we conduct the determination in a parameter-free style i.e to compute an expected utility of the distance threshold pattern and return the results with the maximum expected utility Several advanced pruning algorithms are then developed in order to efìciently nd the desired distance thresholds Finally the experimental evaluation on three real data sets demonstrates the performance of our proposed methods In particular we evaluate the effectiveness of returned results in the violation detection application and show that the pruning techniques can achieve lower time cost A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No 611411 National Grand Fundamental

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
