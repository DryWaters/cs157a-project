This article presents PARNT, a novel LNTRO technique that is widely applicable and may help ontology developers to gain more efficiency in this task, because of its higher level of parametrization and more adequate solutions to the refinement phase of LNTRO \(section V\, which performs a better separation between valid and invalid relationships The paper is organized in seven sections. Section II introduces a formal definition of ontology. Section III defines the general process for LNTRO. Then, section IV describes some representative techniques of the state of the art in LNTRO and which solutions they adopt for each of the phases of the general process. PARNT, our proposal for LNTRO, is detailed in section V. Section VI presents and 
discusses an evaluation of PARNT against another state of the art technique. Finally, section VII presents the conclusions concerning the benefits and some future work on our proposal for LNTRO II 
A  F ORMAL D EFINITION OF O NTOLOGY  An ontology is a formal and explicit specification of a shared conceptualization of a domain of interest  Conceptualization refers to an abstract model of some phenomenon in the world. Explicit, means that the type of concepts used and the limitations of their use are explicitly defined. Formal, refers to the fact that the ontology should be

machine readable. Shared, reflects the notion that an ontology captures consensual knowledge, that is, itês not private to some individual but accepted by a group Currently, ontologies are applied in areas such as the communication of software agents [11  in teg rat i on  o f  information [23  com pos iti on of Web  S erv i ces 5    description of contents to facilitate their recovery [15 i n  NLP in the S e m a ntic We b 1 3   in  b u il d i ng kn o w led gebased systems [17 an d in a p pli cat ion s  of k n ow ledg e  management  For m a l l y  an o nt o l o gy c a n b e re pre se nt ed by a 6-tuple [1     1 002 
C I is the set of entities of the ontology. They are designated by one or more terms in natural language. The set C C consists of classes, i.e., concepts that represent entities that describe a set of objects \(for example, çPerson C C  while the set C I is constituted by instances, \(for example Anne Smith C I  H = {kind_of \(c 1 c 2 c 1  C C c 2

This is usually a costly task and the outcome of any LNTRO technique depends on the quality of the corpus used The task aims at identifying a set of possible relationships.  It has the corpus built in the previous phase as input and candidate relationships as its product. It is composed of two subactivities and  The task tag the text using NLP techniques that are necessary for the next steps of LNTRO In the activity, the annotated corpus is searched for evidence suggesting the existence of relationships. For example, Maedche and Staab [2 s i d er  the existence of two instances of ontology concepts in a sentence as evidence that they are non-taxonomically related For Villaverde et al. [12 a r e lat io n sh i p  is id en tif i e d b y  th e  presence of two ontology concepts in the same sentence with a verb between them The relationships obtained from the previous task should not be recommended to the specialist since there is usually a substantial amount of them that do not correspond to good suggestions. For this reason, in the phase, ML techniques may be used to try to deliver the best suggestion to the specialist In the task, he/she selects and possibly edits the relationships to be added to the ontology from those outputted from the previous phase. Finally, in the activity, the file with the ontology is updated with the relationships that were chosen by the specialist IV R ELATED W ORK  Several LNTRO techniques have already been proposed 1 2 5  12 21  25 I n t h i s  sec t i o n s o m e  o f  t h e m  a r e briefly presented and discussed, highlighting the reasons that motivated the development of PARNT Villaverde et al. [1  p r op os e d a L N T R O te ch n i qu e  th at  uses part of speech tagging in the phase in order to identify the verbs. In the extraction of relationships a tuple in the form  and are ontology concepts and is a verb\is generated for each occurrence of two consecutive concepts with a verb between them. For example in the sentence "The young couple have two children." the generated tuple is a candidate relationship. To possibly increase recall, concept synonyms 3 e i n c l uded  i n t h e s e ar ch for  co nc ep t s i n t h e te xt  In the candidate relationships are subjected to an algorithm for mining association rules ha t  r e pr e s e nt   relationships between concepts. For example, the rule means that there is a non-taxonomic relationship between the two concepts "couple" and "child and that the label is the verb "have".

It uses named entity recognition \(NER\, in the phase, to associate instances found in the text to its corresponding classes. In the  phase a tuple in the form  and are ontology concepts\ is generated for both of these situations: for every couple of instances of ontology concepts in the same sentence and for every instance in a title with every instance in its text body. In the candidate relationships are submitted to the algorithm for mining generic association rules [2  in o r de r to p r esen t r elat ion s h i ps  in th e  f o rm  meaning that there is a non-taxonomic relationship between and This algorithm also suggests the best level in the ontology taxonomy to insert the relationship.

In the for each sentence, relationships represented by tuples in the form are extracted for every verb phrase ith the first noun phrase to its left nd the first noun phrase to its right n the phase a statistical solution is adopted, consisting in the execution of predefined formulas to check the degree of relatedness of the extracted tuples with the domain A technique proposed by Fader et al.

In the  the relationships represented by tuples in the form where is a verb phrase and and are the first noun phrases to its left and to its right, are generated for each sentence. In the phase a logistic regression classifier is used to rank the extracted tuples according to their probability of being valid relationships. Two examples of the characteristic variables used by the logistic function are: the sentence has less than ten words and the noun and verb phrases correspond to the complete sentence About the mentioned approaches, Maedche and Staab [2  apply the algorithm for mining generic association rules [2   Athough it performs the proposed functionality of suggesting the adequate hierarchical level for the non-taxonomic relationships, it is hardly applicable in practice. Villaverde et al. [1 u s e, in  th e phase, an algorithm for the extraction of association rules [2 th a t  re c o m m en ds n o n taxonomic relationships including its corresponding verbal labels. However, in practice this solution leads to a decrease in effectiveness when compared to algorithms that suggest a list of labels for each pair of concepts like bag of labels section IV\or even to those that do not suggest any label like the frequency of tuples composed of two concepts For these reasons, these two proposals can present good results only in specific situations. It is the case of the experiment conducted by Villaverde et al. [12  th at  pr es en t e d  reasonable results in extracting non-taxonomic relationships from Genia [7 on ly  be cau s e  a g r e a t am ou n t  of v e rbs  in  th i s  corpus belonged to a relatively small set of unigram verbs Sanchez and Moreno [5 a u t o m a t e t h e co st l y t a sk o f  corpus construction using queries in a web search engine whereas Fader et al. [1  u s e a log is t ic r e g r es s i on  cl as s i f i e r t o  rank non-taxonomic relationships according to their probabilities of being valid ones. However, because they do not have ontology concepts as inputs, like Villaverde et al 12 an d M a e d ch e an d Sta a b  2   th ey con s id er n o u n ph ras es  as concepts and in most cases they do not correspond to the names of the classes used in practice. Furthermore, it complicates the construction of an ontology in a situation in which ontology concepts are already available and also makes it harder to compare their results with those of other techniques PARNT is a more generalist solution to support specialists in finding non-taxonomic relationships in a wide range of pure text corpus and domains, when ontology concepts are available. It is possible because our proposal is parameterized and uses more adequate solutions for the extraction of and phases section V V T HE PARNT  T ECHNIQUE  PARNT is a semi-automatic LNTRO technique that uses NLP and statistical solutions to extract non-taxonomic relationships of predefined ontology concepts from an English corpus Because it is parameterized and provides new solutions like the apostrophe rule \(AR\in the phase and bag of labels in the phase PARNT is able to help developers getting good results in a wider range of situations when compared with most related works. The solutions adopted by PARNT for each phase of the generic process of LNTRO [9 illu st rat e d  in Fig  1  a r e  summarized in Table 1 and described in sections A to E TABLE I PARNT does not define a specific solution to be adopted in this phase and the specialist is the one responsible for choosing the one that best suits the needs for that situation Manual [11 a nd a u t o m a t i c s u p por t e d [14  2 7] gui de l i n es  have been proposed for the construction of corpora However, there is also the possibility of using a corpus already available in the case that the execution of this phase is dispensable This phase aims at adding annotations to the corpus These annotations are needed for the application of the extraction rules selected by the expert in the phase. PARNT applies five techniques of NLP Fig. 2\ executed in the order by which they are described in the following paragraphs Tokenization is a basic NLP task and its execution is a prerequisite for the application of any other NLP technique

Sentence splitter is necessary because the sentence is the linguistic unit from which non-taxonomic relationships are extracted by applying the rules selected in the phase. Lemmatization is used to improve the recall of the search for ontology concepts in the corpus. For example, the matching between the ontology concept  and the term would not occur if the corpus was not lemmatized Morphological analysis classifies words in grammatical categories and is used in conjunction with verb phrase chunking to find verb phrases suggested as labels of the relationships. For example, the verb phrases and are labels for the relationship between the concepts and extracted from the following two sentences respectively and These two NLP techniques are executed only if the SRVP rule \(section C\ is used in the   Figure 2 In this phase, a set of extraction rules selected by the specialist are used to extract candidate relationships from the previously annotated corpus. PARNT provides three types of extraction rules: the sentence rule \(SR\, the sentence rule with verb phrase \(SR\ and the apostrophe rule \(AR\. To illustrate their application, sentences from a corpus in the family law domain and the concepts "marriage", "spouse party", "child support" and "agreement" from its corresponding ontology will be used The SR extraction rule is based on the intuition that two consecutive concepts in the same sentence are probably nontaxonomically related. Considering the and ontology concepts, this rule can be formalized in the regular expression in PCRE \(Perl Compatible Regular Expressions Considering the sentence the tuples    and  would be extracted The sentence rule with verb phrase \(SRVP\considers that two consecutive concepts in the same sentence with a verb phrase tween them are probably nontaxonomically related and can be formalized in the regular expression in PCRE This rule tends to provide lower recall than the SR one, because, for example it cannot extract the tuple from the sentence "The date and place of any previous marriages of either spouse as well as the date, place and circumstances under which they were terminated don't interfere in the present one.", which corresponds to a valid relationship However, SRVP tends to offer higher precision The AR extraction rule is based on the intuition that two consecutive concepts with either strings "ês" or "ê" between them have a high probability of being non-taxonomically related. The apostrophe rule can be formalized with the regular expression in PCRE For example, for the sentence "While the court will generally honor the partiesê agreements as set forth in the separation agreement the extracted tuple would be  The sets of tuples extracted by the extraction rules are represented in Fig. 3. The universe set \(U\corresponds to all pairs of adjacent concepts present in each sentence in a corpus. The sub-sets T and F correspond to tuples that are true relationships and invalid ones respectively, whereas the sets SAR, SSRVP and SSR correspond to all tuples that are extracted with AR, SRVP and SR respectively  Figure 3 SSRVP, meaning that all extraction made by SRVP are also made by SR but not the reverse and that SAR SSR which means that the relationships extracted by AR are not extracted by the SR and vice versa. Furthermore, for most corpora, SAR SSRVP < SSR. With respect to precision and recall the following can be stated: recall\(SR recall\(SRVP recall\(AR\d precision\(SR precision\(SRVP  precision\(AR PARNT provides two statistical solutions for this phase the frequency of co-occurrence and bag of labels The general idea of bag of labels is to calculate the frequency of pairs of ontology concepts  independent of   their order, and store the corresponding verb phrases in its bag of labels. The result is presented to the specialist that chooses the most appropriate verbal label for that relationship. This solu tion is used to filter the relationships extracted with SRVF extraction rule The frequency of co-occurrence calculates the frequency of pairs of ontology concepts independent of their order. This solution is used to filter the relationships

extracted with AR or SR and therefore do not recommended labels to the suggested relationships. For both solutions the specialist can experimentally set the pruning parameter minimum frequency  No technique of NLP, ML or Statistic is capable of replacing the expert decision in an environment of ambiguous nature, as is the learning from natural language sources. Therefore, the goal of this phase is to make the best possible suggestions to the user and give him/her the control over the final decision. Thus, the result of the technique should be evaluated by a specialist before the relationships can be definitely added to the ontology. Issues such as the scope of the knowledge to be represented, the level of generalization, the real need of adding a relationship, its direction and label must ultimately be evaluated, selected and possibly adjusted by an expert. Then a procedure to update the ontology owl file with these non-taxonomic relationships is executed VI E VALUATING PARNT To experimentally evaluate PARNT its recommendations were compared to those made by Villaverde et al  T h i s  technique was chosen because similarly to PARNT it presents the characteristics of having as input the ontology concepts and a corpus in English and also recommends labels to the relationships suggested to the specialist. Genia 7 rp us a nd o n t o l o gy  v e r si o n  3 0 e r e used  a s  i n p u t   The corpus has 2000 documents, 18545 sentences and 436967 words, whereas the ontology has 47 concepts and 28 non-taxonomic relationships used as reference to calculate the evaluation measures recall and precision For this experiment PARNT was configured with SRVP and bag of labels for the and respectively. The parameters minimum frequency, minimum support and minimum confidence of the refinement solutions of bag of labels and mining association rules were all set to zero. The recommendations were ordered by frequency of tuples for PARNT and by confidence for Villaverde et al. [1 R e cal l \(F ig  2  an d  precision \(Fig. 3\ were calculated for the first sixty recommendations taken cumulatively in groups of ten Fig. 4 shows that PARNT had higher recall for the initial set of ten recommendations, and a lower growing rate with the increase in the number of recommendations. This desirable characteristic allows PARNT to perform a better separation between true and false relationships For the same initial set of ten recommendations Villaverde et al. [12  pr esen t e d a l o w er v alu e f o r re ca ll an d  also a lower increasing rate than the one presented by PARNT for subsequent recommendations. This is due to the fact that true relationships are more uniformly distributed across the set of suggested relationships then those suggested by PARNT. This characteristic is undesirable since it makes the separation between true and false relationships more difficult. Furthermore, the specialist has to experimentally set two pruning parameters and not only one, as done with PARNT Fig. 5 shows that PARNT presented higher precision for the initial set of ten relationships than Villaverde et al. [12   It was also noticeable a decreasing rate in precision with the increase in the number of recommendations. This confirms that PARNT makes a better separation between true and false non-taxonomic relationships   Figure 4 C ONCLUDING R EMARKS  LNTRO techniques as well as any other in the area of ontology learning are subject to a great amount of noise because the source from which information is extracted is unstructured. Thus highly customizable solutions are needed for these techniques to be applied to the widest possible range of situations This paper presented PARNT a semiautomatic technique for the extraction of non-taxonomic relationships of ontologies from pure text that uses NLP and statistic solutions. This technique presents several advantages namely the control over the execution of its extraction rules the AR and the bag of labels. The AR gives a differentiated treatment to extractions that have higher probability of being non-taxonomic relationships. As for the bag of labels, it is an origin solution to the refinement phase PARNT was experimentally evaluated comparing its effectiveness in terms of recall and precision to the proposal

 Figure 5. Comparison of èCredibilityê of the schemes   Figure 6. Comparison of the rule reduction rates  Figure 7 shows the comparison of the rule mining times for different size data. When the size of data is relatively small as below 500,000, the proposed scheme takes slightly longer than the FP-growth algorithm, but it is faster for larger size data. It is thus deemed to be preferred for the applications handling big data   Figure 7. Comparison of the data processing times V C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  Reduction of association rules for the given database is a very important issue in the field of socially-aware computing that needs to manipulate large-scale data. A number of studies have been reported regarding the taxonomy of attribute and negative association rule in order to efficiently reduce the data and find the association rule This paper has presented the wTabular-algorithm which reduces the number of association rules by removing the data dissatisfying the minimum weight and employing the Quine-Mccluskey reduction method. Evaluation of the proposed scheme through computer simulation reveals that Supportê, èCredibilityê, rule reduction rate and the data processing time are improved compared to the existing schemes As future study, the proposed approach will be extended for real time processing of streaming data. Note that sensors collect unformatted streaming data in real time. Therefore there is a need for the study on the methodology of association rule reduction to directly handle unformatted data without converting into binary data. Moreover, further research is needed to improve the performance of association rule reduction by constructing the association between the sensors in advance through semantic sensor web. The proposed approach will also be evaluated against a variety of domains and different-size data set  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT   This research was supported in part by Korea Association of Industry, Academy and Research Institute\(C0017380\PA and ADD\(UD10070MD Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea\(NRF\nded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology\(2012R1A1A2040257\ and MSIP\(Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning\, Korea in the ICT R&D Program 2013\(1391105003\ Corresponding author: Hee Yong Youn  R EFERENCES   1

processing. We call these çfile data sourcesé and çtable data sourcesé respectively. Our data sources pane has functionalities to create either table or file data sources by uploading a chosen CSV file, as shown in Figure 11   Figure 12. View Creation Fu nctionality \(left\ in operation \(right  3  Data Source Attachment Each data attach-point has a specific minimum schema  expectation to be able to make use of the data source attached. The minimum schema expectation makes some attributes mandatory. For example, a demographic data source is required to have a çCustomerIDé attribute that uniquely identifies each customer.  It may have any number of additional attributes; for example, in the unsupervised segmentation workflow, any additional attribute of a customer is used by the clustering algorithm to measure the similarity between customers. Often, the minimum schema attribute names may not exactly match the customerês attribute names. For example, the customer may use CustIDé to uniquely identify a customer whereas the attach-point may be expecting çCustomerIDé. We have incorporated a view creation facility that helps the customer to create a non-materialized view by mapping the attributes in her data source to those expected by the minimum schema. Once such a view is created, it appears as another data source, and can be chosen from the drop down list of data sources. Figure 12 shows how view creation functionality gives the user the option to pick an attribute from her source to the minimum schema attribute, in this case ID, CUSTID, TRANSACTIONDATE, and TOTALPRICE 4  Downloading Results We implemented the workflow execution as an asynchronous operation, where the user finishes the setup uploading data, attaching data sources, choosing the workflow to be executed\d clicks on çsubmité. When the results are ready, the web application alerts the user and provides a link to download the results file V  R ELATED W ORK  Literature related to our work may be broadly classified under three heads: \(1\loud Computing for Services, \(2 Analytics Services, and \(3\orkflows for Analytics  Cloud Computing for Services Cloud computing is the umbrella term used to denote the delivery of computing as a service rather than as a product. Cloud computing provides shared resources, software and information to computing devices as a utility over the network. It has become widely popular over the last few years and has been assessed to be no less influential than any of the previous trendsetting technologies [13   T h o ugh m a n y o b s ta c l e s to the u s a g e o f  cloud computing have been identified in e s a me report emphasizes that the utility of cloud computing is likely to outweigh its disadvantages. Cloud computing provides many advantages such as elasticity and transference of over-provisioning and under-provisioning risks. Forecas u g g e s t th at clou d co m p u t i n g  w oul d  grow at a very fast rate over the next few years.  Cloud computing has been used for a variety of tasks such as parallel data mining d g raph an al y tic s 16   Analytics Services Though popular analytics engines such as SAS, SPSS and R started off as stand-alone applications that need to be installed on a server to be used, recent trends suggest that commercial analytics engines are not far off from delivering full-fledged analytics capabilities on the cloud. Predixion Software 13 and Zementis 14 offer scoring of any PMML 15 model over the cloud, whereas SAS has started to offer many of their functionalities over the cloud  How ev er, to th e bes t of ou r k n o w l edg e, th ere h a s been  a very limited work on providing powerful analytics functionalities over the cloud that can readily be used without requiring considerable expertise in analytics and the specific tool to be used  Workflows for Analytics The main novelty of the solution proposed in this paper rests in the usage of configurable and extensible multi-workflows to make it easy to use analytics despite limited technical know-how. Analytics workflows themselves are not novel and are the primary means of using SPSS \(with the SPSS Modeler component\wever, a typical SPSS workflow is designed to be used by personnel who understand the semantics of typical data mining operations. In particular, SPSS provides a fleet of functionality that is powerful enough to be used across domains, and is not specific to the scenario in which it may be deployed. For example, the semantics of the CustID field is unknown to a generic clustering operator, and under a default setting, the clustering operator would use the CustID field also for clustering leading to the undesirable results of    13  http://www.predixionsoftware.com/predixion  14  http://www.zementis.com  15  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_Model_Markup_Language

grouping customers with numerically close CustIDs together. We eliminate the need to explicitly specify the exclusion of such attributes, by folding in the semantics of attributes such as CustID \(among others\to the prepackaged workflows. In a pre-packaged workflow for customer segmentation, the fact that CustID needs to be excluded in clustering would already be already preconfigured. The customer can thereby focus on configuring other parameters that are likely to affect business such as number of clusters in the outp ut or the rules to use in designating customers as high-value or low-value. The concept of multi-flows, where a single template workflow can instantiate many possible workflows, has not been developed in prior literature to the best of our knowledge VI  C ONCLUSIONS  Analytics, despite its apparent utility in improving business has not been adopted widely. The main deterrents include the large upfront cost of procuring computing infrastructure and the cost of setting up an in-house analytics team of statisticians and business analysts. Such costs are so high that many small and medium businesses cannot afford traditional analytics solutions, especially in the developing regions of the world due to a spectrum of other deterrent factors that we have outlined. Many such deterrents may be effectively eliminated by the delivery of analytics services on the cloud. In this paper, we propose configurable pre-packaged multi-flows flows that span multiple workflows\ to deliver analytics services on the cloud towards helping to improve analytics penetration Multi-flows bundle together related workflows enabling users to explore and exploit related functionality by making minor configuration changes. We illustrate how changes to workflow configurations may be made easily without any in-depth knowledge of the various operators involved. Our multi-flows are easily extensible to non-disruptively include new functionalities in response to the changing needs of a customer \(or a changing customer base We described a survey of Indian retail players that helped us identify \(and validate our assumptions of\e primary obstacles to analytics penetration in the sector; we also analyzed the major analytics needs of such businesses. We illustrated that many such common analytics needs may be effectively captured within a small number of workflows We developed a fully-functional system that implements the chosen multi-flows for the retail sector. We detailed the various features of the system, the multi-ness of the flows in the system, and example configuration settings that can be used to fine tune specific multi-flows. Through generous usage of screenshots, we illustrated the ease of use of our system; we expect that such enhanced convenience of usage will aid penetration of analytics into new customer bases  Future Work We are exploring further enhancements to improve ease of use of analytics solutions on the cloud including an automatic mapping of attributes in data sources to attach-points by exploiting the data type and distribution Also, making analytics widespread would necessarily involve addressing some of the problems that are applicable to cloud computing in general. These include concerns about data privacy in the cloud and the loss of control of the computation elopin g techn iqu es  to eff ecti v el y an d  provably anonymize of data without affecting the results of specific operators such as clustering or classification is an interesting direction to pursue A CKNOWLEDGMENT  We thank Abhishek Subramanian, Neethu Suresh Shubhendu Aggarwal and Varun Srivastava for efforts in implementing the system and performing market surveys VII  R EFERENCES  1  Todd Morrison, çRetail chain uses in-house analytics team to run SAP BusinessObjectsé, TechTarget Search SAP, 4 th March, 2011 http://searchsap.techtarget.com/news/2240033086/Retail-chain-uses-in-houseanalytics-team-to-run-SAP-BusinessObjects  2  Rakesh Agrawal, and Ramakrishnan Srikant, çFast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules in Large Databasesé,  VLDB 1994, Chile 3  How to structure a business analytics team http://mybusinessanalytics.blogspot.in/2011/09/business-analytics-teamstructure.html Retrived March 2, 2012 4  MA Rappa, çThe utility business model and the future of computing services IBM Systems Journal, 43\(1\ 2004 5  Brian Hayes, çCloud Computingé, Comm.

differential dependencies  DD s in real applications like violation detection in this paper we study the problem of determining the distance thresholds for metric distance constraints from data Instead of manually specifying requirements of various statistical measures we conduct the determination in a parameter-free style i.e to compute an expected utility of the distance threshold pattern and return the results with the maximum expected utility Several advanced pruning algorithms are then developed in order to efìciently nd the desired distance thresholds Finally the experimental evaluation on three real data sets demonstrates the performance of our proposed methods In particular we evaluate the effectiveness of returned results in the violation detection application and show that the pruning techniques can achieve lower time cost A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No 611411 National Grand Fundamental

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
