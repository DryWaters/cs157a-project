changed significantly.  These images contain wealth of information which if analysed properly, may derive useful knowledge and assist physicians for diagnosis and prognosis of severe diseases  Many cancer related deaths are reported in the world mainly because of Brain tumours which can be diagnosed early using CT scan brain images. But as per survey, during regular screening by radiologists, 10 to 30 % tumour cells are missed. So, many Computer Aided Diagnosis systems are proposed to improve efficiency of screening and to give second opinion to physician about abnormalities which could be missed during screening  Research has been carried out to diagnose from medical 
images using techniques like Classification, Association Rule Mining, Clustering or combination of algorithms They mainly suffer either because of lower classification accuracy or memory constraint to process large set of medical images. So, parallel algorithms which can process large set images as well as algorithms which give higher classification accuracy are required Proposed Hybrid approach discusses parallel implementation of FP-Growth Association Rule Mining algorithm with J48 Classification which gives reasonably acceptable classification accuracy. Various classifiers are compared with J48 classifier based on accuracy and experimental results have shown convincing results  Section II discusses contribution of researchers\220 in medical 
diagnosis using various techniques and approaches. Section III discusses performance issues in techniques presented by researchers. Method for medical diagnosis is proposed in section IV. Various classification algorithms are tested in Section V followed by discussion and future scope of method in section VI and VII

8 applied image mining in the domain such as breast mammograms to classify and detect the cancerous tissue. A hybrid approach of feature selection using fast branch and bound algorithm and hybrid genetic algorithms are used Mammogram image can be classified into normal, benign and malignant class. Total of 24 features including histogram intensity features and GLCM features are extracted from mammogram images. A hybrid approach of feature selection is proposed which approximately reduces 75% of the features and new decision tree is used for classification. Experiments have been taken for a data set of 300 images taken from MIAS of different types with the aim of improving the accuracy by generating minimum no of rules to cover more patterns

decision tree methods. The major steps involved in the system are: pre-processing, feature extraction, association rule mining and hybrid classifier. The pre-processing step has been done using the median filtering process and edge features have been extracted using canny edge detection technique. The frequent patterns from the CT scan images are generated by frequent pattern tree \(FP-Tree\orithm that mines the association rules. The decision tree method has been used to classify the medical images for diagnosis The hybrid method improves the efficiency of the proposed method than the traditional image mining methods. The experimental result on prediagnosed database of brain images showed 97% sensitivity and 95% accuracy respectively. The physicians can make use of this accurate decision tree classification phase for classifying the brain images into normal, benign and malignant for effective medical diagnosis

 pres en ted f a s t alg orit hm s  for mining association rules using hybrid algorithm called AprioriHybrid.  They have considered the problem of discovering association rules between items in a large database of sales transactions and presented two new algorithms for solving this problem that are fundamentally different from the known al gorithms. Empirical evaluation shows that these algorithms outperform the known algorithms by factors ranging from three for small problems to more than  order of magnitude for large problems. Paper shows how the best features of the two proposed algorithms can be combined into a hybrid algorithm, called AprioriHybrid. Scale-up experiments show that AprioriHybrid scales linearly with the number of transactions. AprioriHybrid also has excellent scale-up properties with respect to the transaction size and the number of items in the database

Yet, its interpretation is notoriously difficult. This explains the continued interest in computer-aided diagnosis for chest radiography. The purpose of this survey is to categorize and briefly review the literature on computer analysis of chest images, which comprises over 150 papers published in the last 30 years. Remaining challenges are indicated and some directions for future research are given

Multilayer Perceptron might over fit the training unless the measures like cross validation are used wisely. Also the time taken to construct Mulitlayer Perceptron is very high .The data required to train Neural Netw ork is high compared to all other algorithms  Neural network is hard to express human expert\220s knowledge and experience, and the construction of its topological structure lacks of theoretical methods. All these can make the image processing method by neural networks unstable. For achieving a high and reliable performance for non-training cases, a large number of training cases are commonly required .If an ANN is trained with only a small number of cases, the generalization ability will be low  B

be improved by the use of further semantics It is promising that the method with the most sophisticated semantics the FM method achieved the highest value of the F-measure The successful application in the cooking domain highlights that a pipes-and-lters framework is a good means to combine domain-specic and domain-independent lters In future we are going to implement an evaluation based on a taxonomical distance We expect our approaches to achieve better assessments when using this intelligent semantical distance To prove that our approach is not limited to cooking recipes we are going to implement a new domain 9 Acknowledgements This work was funded by the German Research Foundation project number BE 1373/3-1 References  ASD-STE100 http://www asd-ste100.or g/request.html  A Aamodt and

are non-overlapping These previous results focus on the case that users are stationary and can associate with any AP When users are mobile Mittal et al in studied the distributed access point selection game by assuming that users are homogeneous with the same cost of mobility Here we propose a state-based game framework to formulate the more general case that users have heterogeneous cost of mobility VIII C ONCLUSION In this paper we consider the database-assisted whitespace AP network design We address the channel selection problem among the APs and the distributed AP association problem of the secondary users through the game theoretic approach We propose a distributed AP channel selection algorithm and a distributed AP association algorithm both of which that converge to the corresponding equilibrium globally Numerical results show that the algorithms can achieve mutually acceptable resource allocation and are robust to the perturbation by secondary users dynamical leaving and entering the system For the future work we are going to generalize the results to the case that each AP can choose multiple vacant channels to operate and the number of channels that an AP chooses depends on the number of its associated users Although the distributed AP association algorithm can achieve the state-based Nash equilibrium wherein all users are satised given their mobility cost factors the loads among different APs can be quite imbalanced when the mobility cost is high as demonstrated in the numerical results Thus how to design an incentive compatible mechanism such as pricing to achieve load balance among the APs with mobile secondary users will be very interesting and challenging ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work is supported by the General Research Funds Project Number 412509 412710 and 412511 established under the University Grant Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region China R EFERENCES  FCC Second memorandum opinion and order   September 23 2010 A v ailable http://transition.fcc.go v/Daily Releases/Daily Business/2010/db0923/FCC-10-174A1.pdf  R Murty  R Chandra T  Moscibroda and P  Bahl Senseless A database-driven white spaces network in IEEE Symposia on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Netoworks DySpan  2011  IEEE 802.22 W orking Group IEEE 802.22 draftv3.0  2011 A v ailable http://www ieee802.or g/22  P  Gupta and P  R K umar  The capacity of wireless networks IEEE Transactions on Information Theory  vol 46 no 2 pp 388404 2000  D Monderer and L S Shaple y  Potential games  Games and Economic Behavior  vol 14 pp 124143 1996  N Li and J R Marden Designing games to handle coupled constraints in IEEE CDC  2010 pp 250255  D Gurne y  G Buchw ald L Ecklund S K uf fner  and J Grosspietsch Geo-location database techniques for incumbent protection in the TV white space in IEEE Symposia on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Netoworks DySpan  2008  H R Karimi Geolocation databases for white space de vices in the UHF TV bands Specication of maximum permitted emission levels in IEEE Symposia on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Netoworks DySpan  2011  M Nek o v ee Quantifying the a v ailability of TV white spaces for cognitive radio operation in the uk Tech Rep 2009 A v ailable http://arxi v or g/abs/0906.3394v1  P  Bahl R Chandra T  Moscibroda R Murty  and M W elsh White space networking with Wi-Fi like connectivity in SIGCOMM  2009 pp 2738  X Feng J Zhang and Q Zhang Database-assisted multiap network on TV white spaces Architecture spectrum allocation and ap discovery in IEEE Symposia on New Frontiers in Dynamic Spectrum Access Netoworks DySpan  2011  S Deb V  Srini v asan and R Maheshw ari Dynamic spectrum access in DTV whitespaces design rules architecture and algorithms in MOBICOM  2009 pp 112  R Southwell J Huang and X Liu Spectrum mobility games in IEEE INFOCOM  2012  X Chen and J Huang Spatial spectrum access game Nash equilibria and distributed learning in ACM International Symposium on Mobile Ad Hoc Networking and Computing MobiHoc  2012  X W ang Z Li P  Xu Y  Xu X Gao and H Chen Spectrum sharing in cognitive radio networksan auctionbased approach IEEE Transactions on Systems Man and Cybernetics Part B Cybernetics  vol 40 no 3 pp 587 596 2010  V  Gajic J Huangy  and B Rimoldi Competition of wireless providers for atomic users Equilibrium and social optimality in 47th annual Allerton conference on Communication control and computing  2009  L Duan J Huang and B Shou Cogniti v e mobile virtual network operator Investment and pricing with supply uncertainty in IEEE INFOCOM  2010  M Hong A Garcia and J Barrera Joint distrib uted access point selection and power allocation in cognitive radio networks in INFOCOM  2011 pp 25162524  K Mittal E M Belding and S Suri  A game-theoretic analysis of wireless access point selection by mobile users Computer Communications  vol 31 no 10 pp 20492062 2008

Figure 6 is not as signicant as that of 1st largest answers For example in Rule 1 with 1m data size DA  PAP has an improvement about 2200 from 5500 to 3300 in Figure 2 while the corresponding improvement is only about 1500 from 5500 to 4000 in Figure 6 Nevertheless DAP  PAP can still keep the lowest time cost in all the test in Figure 6 VII C ONCLUSIONS Motivated by the utility of differential dependencies  DD s in real applications like violation detection in this paper we study the problem of determining the distance thresholds for metric distance constraints from data Instead of manually specifying requirements of various statistical measures we conduct the determination in a parameter-free style i.e to compute an expected utility of the distance threshold pattern and return the results with the maximum expected utility Several advanced pruning algorithms are then developed in order to efciently nd the desired distance thresholds Finally the experimental evaluation on three real data sets demonstrates the performance of our proposed methods In particular we evaluate the effectiveness of returned results in the violation detection application and show that the pruning techniques can achieve lower time cost A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No 611411 National Grand Fundamental

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresby PCA, number of records by FP-Growth By experiments, found the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
