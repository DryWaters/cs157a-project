It is useful and concrete to develop a model with some intelligent methods in artificial intelligence area for the prediction of some big structure projects. The validity of the models has been proved by some civil engineering practices Therefore, the research of bearing capacity and settlement characteristics of rigid pile composite foundation has been the focus of the basic engineering research area in foundations. This paper established a model based on the Gray RBF neutral network which is a combination of gray model and RBF neutral network model and realized the model with Matlab7.0 Keywords  Gray neutral network,  pile capacity  Prediction model  I  INTRODUCTION Typically, many measures have also been proposed and studied to quantify various aspects of rules, such as confidence, uncertainty, applicability, quality, accuracy usefulness and interestingness. As the association rules data mining model has extensive applications, which mainly process the concept forma tion and concept relation identification. The association rules mining has played an important role in data mining technologies. However, the association rules mining canít satisfy the massive or little data mining problems today. Gray neutral network is a natural mixture of gray model and neural network model, which contains the gray system that using small sample to model and neural networkís advantages in self-adaption to nonlinear and inaccurate regulations  The GA method is adopted to find the best fit of weights for each software effort driver in the similarity measures. Experimental results show that the software effort estimation using an integration of the grey relational analysis with GA method presents more precise estimates over the results using the case based reasoning classification and regression trees and artificial neural networks methods. The grey system theory is a useful method that is applicable to unascertained problems with too little data or information. Therefore, this paper is based on consulting massive related literature material, a study of artificial intelligent simulation identification research is carried on the Bearing Capacity of Pile Foundation  II  GRAY  RBF  NEUTRAL  NETWORK  MODEL Gray RBF neutral network is a combination of gray model and RBF neutral network model. Many experiment results had proved that the performance of this combination predicting model is better than the single ones. It has the advantage of gray system that using small samples to modeling and that of neural network in self-adaption to nonlinear and inaccurate regulations A  Gray theory model As we know, AGO GM \(1,1\odel is usually applied to one dimension grey problem. The model is a time series forecasting models, encompassing a group of differential equations adapted for parameter variance, rather than differential equation.  In this paper, we just have applied the AGO theory into Gary RBF neutral network  Denote system feature data sequence \(n measured values\ original sequence    2   1    0   0   0   0  n x x x X  1 Its 1-AGO \(accumulated generating operation\ sequence as follow   2     2   1   1   1   1   1  n x x x X  Where n k i x x k i k  2  1     0  1   1    002   B  RBF neutral network RBF neutral network is a three-layer forwards network.

In civil engineering, it is general considered that there are 2 main factors of  the Pile Capacity one is the Pile Parameter, the other one is the Geological Environment The Pile Capacity is the complicated composition including the sectional area, the pile length 001 the elastic modulus of material and the material density. According to the division of the Geological Environment into different soil layers, a single of pile may run though more than ten kind of soil layers.     Every soil layer contains the void ratio, the liquid limit, the plastic limit, the compression modulus, the blow count of standard penetration and other kinds of parameters However, the influence of Bearing Capacity of Pile Foundation is much more factors, and among these factors also have complex relationship. So it is difficulty to summarize the accurate calculation formation of the Pile capacity. Nowadays in engineering design , it is used the semiempirical theories which based on many experimental foundation. But out of safety considerations, it is always given the conservative design division, causing a certain waste. So there is an important problem ìhow to reasonably determine the Bearing Capacity of Pile Foundation during the pile engineering designing B  Structure strength There are so many factors which influence the structure strength of the bridge, that can come down to 3 aspects, such as the Environmental Factors, the load factors, and the material factors. According the above factors, it is certain to built the strength attenuation model  as        i ci s p t f R K K t R 007   p K is the uncertain stochastic variable s K is the teamwork coefficient of steel and concrete R  KÙK is the stochastic process which calculated the standard value of the lumped parameter and the material parameter The change of the structure strength can be divided to 2 stages in the general environment condition. At one stage which came from the built structureís time to c t the carbonation of concrete never reach the surface of steel so that the structure strength can not decrease. At the other stage which came from c t to T , the steel rusted so the structure strength continuously decreases. According the above research of the time-varied factors, it is easy to get the time-variant strength expression

Furthermore, it is easy and feasible to establish the model in the engineering  project. The accuracy prediction result will be helping for the capacity prediction and determination of the bridge project or some other structure projects V  CONCLUTION The precision of the model bases on the pile capacity which has average error is 6.215%   , and it is less than the  other result of the neural network model. This paper proposed the Gray neural network prediction model for the pile capacity application. The prediction data of this intelligent method has showed the better accuracy , so it is easy to get the precision of the Bearing Capacity of Pile Foundation in the project              R EFERENCES   1 Z h o n g L u o  Re se ar chi n g o f F o r w ar d G e ner a ting N e ur al N e tw o r k,  P r o c   of Inter.

The navigation system uses GPS to determine aircraft position and the mini inertial system to determine aircraft attitude Information is acquired every second and is compared to mission path parameters and terrain data base information previously obtained from 3D navigation charts. All information is properly proce ssed and the current position is shown to the pilot All hardware devices to the laptop computer are controlled by the navigation software. An external data file is loaded with the mission information plan by the navigation software The navigation software can manage the acquisition of mission and telemetry data, perform aircraft position and navigation calculations, present the results of the calculations in a graphic interface, manage the video images from the aircraft and build the visual and graphic interface to the user in real time This section presents the general development techniques used, as well as the structure and logic functioning of the navigation software.

However the main objective of the 3D Navigation Module is the 3D representation of navigation data to complete the navigation software In the following description we are not detailing the graphic computations, i.e. rotation matrix, translation and scale variation  We are just showing how to create a 3D navigator generator to be used with the navigation software Computation details are properly described in references such 8 and 9  In 1 0  one fi nd s a descri pt i o n o f t h e pertinent algorithms with calculation implementation. Thus implementation itself became relatively easy To clarify the use of geometric transformations and its use in the 3D generator software, [1 desc ri bes basi c s o ft wa r e  to manipulate and present a 3D cube using rotation translation etc In this software the geometric shape is a cube presented as 223wireframe\224. In order to do ge ometric transformations of the cube it is necessary to create a set of cube vertices coordinates. In this case ther e are 8 vertices and 12 line segments that join these verti ces. Three matrices are used to represent the coordinates of the vertices, one for each axis one for the X axis, one for Y and one for Z. Thereafter a segments matrix is created to represent the connection of those vertices, the line segments matrix Figure 9 shows the graphic representation of the 3D cube generated by the software sample from   Figure 9 \226 3D cube representation After choosing such cube representation with vertices and line segments, the next stage is to do the transformation calculations needed for gra phic presentation of moving objects. Specific algorithms were developed for rotation translation, scaling and pr ojection to show aircraft movement in the virtual environment  Figure 10 \226 Waypoint representation The same procedures are used in the 3D navigator generator. After the mission data \(coordinates\ read, the next step is the creation of the cubes that will represent the 223waypoints\224 


  6 After the cube representation in terms of vertices and line segments, the next step will be the determination of the cube position for each waypoint. This is done considering coordinate information of the respective waypoints by the navigation software. Figure 10 shows the cube representation at the waypoints Based on computer graphics and calculations of waypoint graphic manipulations, rotation, translation, scale variation and projection tools were developed that can be used in the representation of a real envir onment by a virtual one. The set of these tools was called 3D generator Math functions, e.g., matrix rotation, translation and projection in 3 axes were used as in [12 All p e rtinen t computer graphics components were used to build the 3D navigation generator software.

  7 Figure 13 presents and compares the results of the navigation software and the 3D navigation module. The mission used as example in this figure is the same mission described in the \223Flight Tests\224 section. Observe that it was possible to get the same waypoint representation using both options, the navigation software \(2D\nd the 3D navigation module \(3D  Figure 13 \226 2D route \(navigation software\ and 3D route 3D Navigation Module T ESTS  Ground Tests In the development of flight systems, ground tests are fundamental to reach the de sired reliability. As \223flight system\224 we consider the whole set of software and hardware subsystems, boards, gyros, etc Initially all systems components are tested individuality and then integrated. After integration and simulations, system ground testing starts   Figure 14 \226 Video camera, GPS and laptop installation In this manner it is guaranteed that no EMI 5 between the installed equipment will happen   5 Electronic Magnetic Interference  Figure 15 \226 Ground test location A car was used as mobile platform for ground testing. All components of the navigation system, hardware and software were installed on the car. Installation details are shown in Figure 14 As test area was selected considering heading, altitude speed variations and low traffic Figure 15 shows the chosen ground test place, located in Mogi das Cruzes, SP, Brazil  Figure 16 \226 SpyHawk test systems and navigation software working in \223simulate mode\224 Considering avenues and streets as regular way, the aircraft navigation route was built. Comparing the car path, through 


  8 avenues and streets, with the ai rcraft path, an offset error was found: the aircraft path length is different from the car path length. For the aircraft the total path length was 3975 nautical miles and for the car the total path length was 4120 nautical miles. The difference between the lengths is due to the different route alignments During the ground tests \(car\ two data files were generated to check the mission. One file contains the navigation data and the other contains a video recorded of the working software. Both files were compared. After this initial comparison, a second comparison was done, the video and data with the mission waypoints, defined before the test. For the bench test, the \223simulate mode\224 was set on the navigation software Figure 16 shows the mission done to test the simulated mode Flight Tests Like the ground tests, flight tests are very important to guarantee the perfect working of all subsystems. The same methodology described in the ground tests section was used to test the navigation system in flight. The only difference was the test platform, where a scale 1:1 aircraft was used The main idea to use a manned airplane was to verify and set the navigation system work in real time and during actual flight. The aircraft used for the tests was a Paulystar experimental aircraft used for pilot training \(see Figure 17 This aircraft has 2 seats, one of them for the pilot and the other for the co-pilot or a passenger. The cruise speed is 60 knots  Figure 17 \226 Aircraft used for flight tests During flight tests the video and telemetry links in real time were not used. Needed equipment was directly connected to the PC. The video link was replaced by a webcam that was installed on the airplane. Equipment installation for the flight tests is shown in Figure 18   Figure 18 \226 Video camera, GPS, laptop and Black Box installation \(Video camera recorder Flight tests took location in the area of Mogi das Cruzes and Biritiba Mirim \(see Figure 19\en waypoints were defined to build the mission route. These waypoints were via latitude, longitude and altitude coordinates. To validate the navigation software known locations were selected as waypoints, e.g., buildings, farms and specific locations in Mogi das Cruzes. After the selection of the waypoints and using a flight chart to get the altitude and position of the airport and waypoints, it was possible to create the flight route. The weather condition was a new factor that came into play during the flight tests. During ground tests, the navigation was through avenues and streets without the interference of winds and turbul ence. During the flight test the turbulence can interfere on the set altitude. The wind can interfere on the actual speed and a crossing wind can move the aircraft off the track. The estimated total mission length was 17515 nautical miles and the estimated flight time was 26 minutes. The coordinates of the mission waypoints are shown in Table 1 Table 1 \226 Coordinates / Altitude of flight test waypoints Wyt Latitude Longitude Altitude \(ft 001 -23.56456 -46.06809 2467 002 -23.54437 -46.16402 3900 003 -23.53682 -46.19960 3900 004 -23.52787 -46.14435 3600 005 -23.49994 -46.11372 3600 006 -23.53288 -46.08701 3300 007 -23.56456 -46.06809 2467   Figure 19 \226 Flight test location  


  9 For testing the functionalities of the guidance system different altitudes were considered for the waypoints. The guidance system helps the pilot to find the next route waypoint through a graphics indication of heading and altitude that the aircraft must fly to arrive to the next waypoint The take off was from waypoint 001, located on Hiroy airport in Biritiba Mirim. The local altitude was 2467 ft. The waypoint 002 was used as altitude \223check point\224, the desired altitude was 3900 ft. Keeping 3900 ft, the first visual validating point was the waypoint 003 \(a building\e second visual validating point was waypoint 004. Waypoint 004 was an old radio controlled plane runway, altitude 3600 ft. The third point was a little farm located in the middle of a valley, the waypoint 005. The fourth point was considered altitude \223check point\224, waypoint 006 with 3300 ft and Biritiba Mirim airport heading. The last point, waypoint 007 closed the mission route. The values of waypoint 007 are the same of waypoint 001 Figure 20 shows the waypoints 003, 004 and 005 respectively  Figure 20 \226 Waypoint 003, Building \226 004, old RC runway and 005, little farm  Together with the navigation test, the aircraft instruments\222 values and the software instru ments\222 values were compared throughout the flight. The following values were compared speed, altitude, heading and climb up/down The system was used for aircraft approach, final approach and landing, as shown in Figure 21  Figure 21 \226 Final landing approach After the tests, software \223bugs\224 were observed and eliminated, e.g., the climb indication. Data acquired throughout the flight test was used in simulations for further debugging C ONCLUSIONS AND R ESULTS  Based on the initial proposal of the development of an \223offthe-self\224 UAV system the following observations are considered especially relevant 200  The aircraft prototype should be stable in flight if it is to be used as a trainer, in order to minimize the control needs provided by the electronic equipment. It also defines the control methodology type.  Furthermore, the size, weight and cooling of electronic equipment will depend on the aircraft type. For example, the compartment size and the desired aircraft center of gravity \(CG\will define the position of every hard ware item according to its respective weight and si ze. Another important aspect is electrical power consumption that shall be as low as possible 200  For the airborne systems, it was possible to create limited avionics systems using COTS equipment e.g., the handheld GPS and COTS boards. The operational limit of such equipment will be defined by the type of the mission, in terms of distance and mission time. E.g., excessive accumulated GPS navigation error or the IMU reference attitude error could lead to catastrophic fault. It was observed that the main aspect of the use of COTS equipment is the integration methodology 


  10 200  It was demonstrated that it is possible to build a 223homebuilt\224 navigation system using \223off-the-self\224 equipment. In our case, a handheld GPS was used along with standard flight navigation techniques computer graphics and computer programming The navigation system was able to navigate through a preset route 200  In the 3D Navigation Module, it was possible to create a virtual 3D envir onment to represent the real environment, using points. The points are the 223waypoints\224 that were previously defined during mission route creation 200  It was shown that it is possible to navigate inside the 3D environment using some computer graphics methods and tools. Using navigation algorithms and some synchronism adjustment it is possible to build virtual tunnels to aid the pilot\222s navigation 200  For the ground station a main problem is the delay time, which should be as low as possible. The typical operation altitude lies between 20 and 2000 feet above the local terrain with a cruising speed of 100 km/h. Considering the aircraft control at an altitude around 20 feet above the local terrain flying at 100 km/h the \223r eal time\224 control must be the most \223real time\224 possi ble to keep the control under the typical operation conditions without a catastrophic event If regular use of the software in the aircraft / UAV is intended, still more time on ground / flight testing is recommended R EFERENCES   G Fahlst rom  and T h omas J.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs. Essentially, Atom Service Casting may be viewed as a more human-friendly approach to UDDI R EFERENCES   NASA and Energy and W a t e r cy cl e St udy NEW S website: http://www.nasa-news.org  R odgers, C  D., and B  J.
