Determination of the Factors that Influence Consumers\222 Trust in Business-toConsumers Electronic Commerce An Empirical Approach  Radwan M. AL-Dwairi, Mumtaz A. Kamala SCIM, Department of Computing University of Bradford Bradford, UK R.M.AlDwairi@Bradford.ac.uk m.a.kamala@Bradford.ac.uk    Abstract 227 Trust in the context of Business-to-Consumer B2C electronic commerce EC is complex and a multidimensional construct It is affected by many internal and external factors These factors might change overtime Therefore trust value becomes dynamic and creates a big 
challenge Although many researchers studied the effect of different factors on consumers\222 trust the trust literature lacks clear differentiation among the factors contributing to trust and fails to capture its multidimensional nature. Thus this research presents a holistic approach that study trust empirically in the context of B2C EC and attempts to determine the major factors that affect consumers\222 trust The research provides a valuable feedback for e-commerce web site designers and for e-vendors as well Keywords- trut; risk; privacy; security;e-commerce, B2C 
I   I NTRODUCTION  The influence of trust is crucial in online environment where there is no face-to-face interaction between the transacting parties Moreover the open and global nature of the Internet as a transacting infrastructure creates uncertainty around online transactions  Consequently consumers\222 uncertainty on the transaction outcome will increase and trust plays an important factor in consumers\222 decision to transact online [7  In  s uc h  a  c y b e r s p a c e   m a n y  objects like people organizations and software agents interact with strangers and deal with different types of information from different sources without a live 
interaction This makes trust a crucial factor on the Web 8   In EC the interaction between consumers and evendors is done through the company\222s website by using the Internet as a communication channel Consequently consumers\222 first impression about the virtual company is formulated from its website Thus its characteristics like ease of use and attractiveness affect consumers\222 trust and their intention to transact online 9  I n a ddi t i o n t o  t hi s   there are many factors that have a significant impact on consumers\222 trust like personal, Psychological and technical skills 20  M o r e ov e r  t he  a s s e s s m e n t  o f  t he  trustworthiness of e-vendors is a critical factor which 
affects consumers\222 trust and their willingness to transact online [3, 17, 19    In this environment, the security of online transactions and consumers\222 privacy are determinant factors for the success of EC.  Thus, Consumers who engage in EC need to feel confident that their transactions are secure and safe from alteration In some cases a certain proportion of goods that customers ordered at a site never arrived in other cases the amount which is actually charged was higher than expected [23    O n t he  o t he r ha nd   Co ns um e r s  have absolutely no control over what happens with the traces they leave in the Internet Consequently, customers will be under a continuous threat as long as their identity

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses some important issues in EC Section 3 presents the concept of trust and its usage in the Information Technology IT field In addition this section highlights the relationship between trust and risk Section 4 
introduces the methodology of the study Section 5 explains the findings of the study and data analysis Moreover this section includes discussion and highlights opportunities for future research Section 6 presents the study limitations and Section 7 provides research conclusion II  E LECTRONIC COMMERCE  Pather [23  m e n t i o ne d t h a t  t h e  a dv e nt  o f E C W e b  s i t e s  formulates a new type of user that is located outside the physical domain of the organization or business; it is the ecustomer.

states that the challenges of EC can be summarized as follows attracting consumers making them visit the site establishing trust, making them buy and, most importantly making them coming back  It is obvious that using the Web for conducting commercial activities like B2C EC creates a fundamental problem which is how a client knows what happens at a remote site [24    M o r e ov e r  B2C  EC transactions don\222t involve simultaneous exchange of goods where the intended purchase may be from a supplier in a different country time zone currency and legal system 18   T he r e fo re   t rus t  pl a y s  a n i m p o r t a nt  fa c t o r which alleviates consumers\251 uncertainty about their transactions III  T HE CONCEPT OF TRUST  Chopra and Wallace 15  po i nt e d o u t  t h a t  t h e  c o nc e pt  of trust has been addressed within many disciplines including philosophy sociology economic and organization theory This formulated a body of research which is widely divergent and contradictory Moreover Chang et al 20 a rg u e d t ha t  t r u s t  i s  o ne  o f  t he  fuz z i e s t  dynamic and complex concepts in both social and business relationships.  The fuzzy nature of trust indicates that it is imprecise and sometimes unclear when its level needs explanation. Moreover, its value is not constant but always changing over time Trust is a multi-dimensional construct 6 10  w i t h interrelated components [6   Ba s i c a l l y   t rus t  i s  e s t a b l i s h e d  in an interaction between two entities 8   H ow e v e r  t he  trust level will be different according to the type of relationship between the two parties Mayer et al 17  defined trust as 223 the willingness of a party to be vulnerable to the actions of another party based on the expectation that the other will perform a particular action important to the trustor irrespective of the ability to monitor or control that other party\224.  Pavlou [7  de s c ri b e d trust as 223the belief that the other party will behave in a socially responsible manner and will fulfill the trusting party\222s expectation without taking advantage of its vulnerabilities\224.  Always there are two parties involved in the process of trust the trustor and the trustee In this scenario, the trustor is considered as an object who likes to rely on the trustee another object for a service that the trustee offers. Thus the trust association between the two objects can be represented by a two-way relationship between the trustor and trustee with two different trust values [20   In general, when it is said that entity A trusts entity B the key questions that should be addressed is on what thing does A trusts B What is the context of the relationship To highlight this issue let us consider the following two examples Sara says I trust the bank Ali says I trust the doctor These two examples show that many aspects of trust are implicit because the Trusting Agent in both examples cannot explicitly specify the level of their belief and willingness or cannot specify the context and time frame in relation to trust 20    A l i 251 s  o p i ni on  a bo ut  t he  doctor might change overtime Also Ali\251s thinking overtime might change The same is for Sara Thus the fuzziness and dynamic nature of trust is clearly evident in the above examples Moreover the extent to which the trustor is willing to trust the trustee is affected by the trustor\222s propensity to trust and the trustor\222s perceived of trustworthiness of the trustee which is determined by the trustee\222s ability, integrity and benevolence [17  A  Trust in the IT field In the Information system field, many researchers tried to study the impact of security and trust on EC For example Egger 1 s t udi e d  how  t h e  h um a n-c o m p ut e r  interaction HCI design of EC systems can increase the trustworthiness of a commercial web site.

Kong and Hung [3  po i nt e d  t h a t  individuals will only engage in a trusting behaviour when the level of trust exceeds the level of perceived risk On the other side of the spectrum trust helps consumers overcome perceptions of uncertainty and perceived risk and engage in trust-related behaviours with e-vendors 18   Z e ng  e t  a l   2 6  e xpl a i n e d t h a t  t rus t  a nd  risk have intrinsic relation: risk is the premise of trust and trust can lower the risk of EC. For this, trust is the bridge between risk and EC IV  M ETHODOLOGY  A  Instrument development Based on the literature review of trust in B2C EC and some ideas from previous questionnaires a questionnaire was created as an instrument for collecting data for this study The questionnaire consisted of three sections Section A intended to collect demographic data from respondents like age gender education employment income per year in U and nationality  Section B was used to collect data about Internet usage and security Section C intended to collect data about consumers\222 trust in Internet shopping The majority of the questions rate respondents on a Likert scale of 5-1 with end points of 223strongly agree\224 and \224strongly disagree\224  respectively B  Instrument validation In this study, a self administered questionnaire was the instrument used to collect data Thus no one will be present with respondents to clarify any difficulty in answering the questions. For this, the researchers reviewed and checked every question in the instrument.  In addition the researchers measured the approximate necessary time that was needed to complete the questionnaire and found that it took from 8 to 10 minutes The questionnaire was pilot tested using 23 lecturers and technicians who have a good experience in online shopping Those people were not only asked to answer the questionnaire but also to check and verify the questions and to give their suggestions and feedback Based on the collected feedback many questions were reworded some were deleted and some were added C  Sample The population of this study encompasses 276 individuals from different nationalities who work and reside in Sultanate of Oman. Employees in four technical colleges Sultan Qaboos University and one bank participated in this study  This resulted in a sample that was well distributed in terms of demographic information like age gender education and nationality Of the 276 questionnaires that were distributed 242 questionnaires were retuned back providing a response rate approximately 88 After checking the retuned questionnaires the researchers found that 110 respondents never used the online shopping. Thus, in order to achieve accurate results the researchers decided to exclude them from the study Furthermore one questionnaire was rejected As a result 131 questionnaires were used in the study In contrast to Pavlou [7  a nd  M c K ni g ht   6   w h o  u s e d a  homogenous sample of students to study trust in B2C EC we had to use a heterogeneous sample of respondents in our study For this the study utilized respondents from different nationalities who have their own values and traditions and can use the Internet to shop online without any geographic limitations Table 1 represents the characteristics of respondents TABLE I  R ESPONDENTS 222  C HARACTERISTICS N    131 Nationality \(Region Middle East 80 \(61.1 Far East 13 \(9.9 Australia/New Zealand 4 \(3.1 North America 14 \(10.7 Europe 6 \(4.6 Africa 6 \(4.6  No response 8 \(6.1 Gender  Male 94 \(71.8 Female 35 \(26.7  No response 2 \(1.5 Age  18-25 18 \(13.7 26-35 36\(27.5 36-50 42 \(32.1  Above 50 35 \(26.7 Education  High School 1  \(0.8 Diploma 5  \(3.8 Bachelor 23 \(17.6 Master 69 \(52.7  PhD 33 \(25.2 Number of online transactions \(last year  No transactions 14 \(10.7 One transaction 24  \(18.3 Two transactions 32  \(24.4 Three Transactions 19  \(14.5 Four Transactions 13 \(9.9  More than Four Transactions 29 \(22.1  D  Internal reliability Bryman 27 p70  s t a t e d  t ha t  re l i a b i l i t y  i s  fundamentally concerned with issues of measures Cronbach\222s alpha is a commonly used test for internal reliability For this the researchers used the same test to measure the reliability of the used instrument. \(SPSS v.16 was used for this computation  The value of Cronbach\222s alpha for the items of this study is 0.728. Since the value of Cronbach\222s alpha is greater than 0.70 the items of the study can be used for analysis with acceptable reliability

V  F INDINGS OF THE STUDY  A  Data analysis The descriptive statistics for the items of the study shows that the high load of items are referring to the characteristics of the e-vendor like reputation and quality of services user satisfaction from previous interactions with e-vendors and the quality of commercial Web sites For all the mentioned above items the Mean is greater than 4 which represents a high load In the next level of load where the Mean value is greater than 3 and less than 4 many items were listed in this category Consumers experience with commercial Web sites had the highest load in this category with Mean value of 3.98 Moreover many items that refer to the characteristics of the commercial Web site like ease of use complete information security seal fast download attractiveness and availability of communication options with e-vendors were listed in this category Items that represent security privacy and risks were also listed in this category  The effect of some external factors like friends on consumers\251 behaviour towards specific e-vendors is clearly evident in this study since its load is 3.73 which represent a relatively high load. On the other side, the load of presence of visual presentation aids like graphics and audio in commercial Web sites is less than 3 which represented a weak response load In addition one type of risk which represents consumers\222 fear from paying more when transacting online is also a weak response Table 2 shows the descriptive statistics of the items In order to consider whether differences in a crosstabulation about consumers\222 opinions are statistically significant, a two-way chi-square test was implemented for the items of the study against different consumers\222 demographic characteristics like gender nationality, age and level of education Results show that there are some significant differences between male and female respondents about receiving the same items that were ordered online This significant difference is represented by a value of 0.011 for Pearson Chi-Square. Results show that 45.7 of males and 17.1 of females disagree with having a fear from not receiving the same items that they ordered online On the other hand 5.1 of males and 17.1% of females strongly agree that they have a fear from not receiving the same items that they ordered online TABLE II  D ESCRIPTIVE S TATISTICS  Trust Building Factors N Mean Reputation 131 4.31 Service quality 131 4.21 Consumer satisfaction 131 4.21 Trusting a Web site 131 4.02 Experience 131 3.98 Ease of use 130 3.92 Communication options 130 3.92 Personal information 130 3.91 Complete information 131 3.86 Presence of Security Seal 128 3.82 Trust transitivity 131 3.73 Fast download 131 3.69 Clear privacy statement 130 3.58 Fear credit card captured 130 3.48 Web page attractiveness 131 3.12 Fear items quality not good 129 3.11 Fear not receive same items 131 3.06 Visual presentation aids 131 2.92 Fear to pay more 131 2.89  Furthermore respondents in different levels of education are significantly different in their opinions about the influence of the presence of the security seal in trusting a Website This difference is represented with a value of 0.033 for Pearson Chi-Square Results show that 9.4 of PhD\222s respondents and 21.7 of Bachelor\222s respondents disagree to trust a Web site which is sealed by a security seal Moreover respondents with different ages are statistically different in their opinions about receiving the same items that they ordered online For example 11.1 of respondents of ages between 18 and 25 and 54.8 of respondents of ages between 36 and 50 disagree to have fear from not receiving the same items that they ordered online Furthermore respondents from different regions are significantly different in sharing their personal information over the Web Results show that 16.7 of European respondents, 24.1% of Middle East respondents and 57.1 of North America respondents are strongly agree that they hesitate to share their personnel information over the Web Moreover respondents from different regions are significantly different about the effect of the fast download on trusting a B2C EC Web page For example 50 of North America respondents and 26.2 of Middle East respondents agree that the fast download of a web page is an important factor for trusting the Web page Furthermore respondents from different regions are significantly different in their opinions about their behaviour towards a Web site that they trust. For example 66.6% of European respondents and 13.8% of Middle East respondents strongly agree with having a positive behaviour to shop online from a Web site that they trust B  Discussion of the results and future research While several implications can be drawn from the results of this study two major findings are of particular importance. First, the results highlight the importance of evendors\251 trustworthiness in persuading consumers to transact online Results show that 96.9 of respondents agree that high quality of services offered by e-vendors positively encourage consumers to shop again from the same e-vendor. Moreover, 96.2% of consumers agree that good reputation of e-vendors positively affect consumers\251 trust with those e-vendors Thus the characteristics of evendors like reputation and quality of services have a big role in establishing consumers\222 trust in B2C EC Second results show that 92.6 of respondents agree that their satisfactions gained from previous interactions with evendors positively influence their trust with e-vendors Results also show that B2C EC Web site characteristics like ease-of-use, fast download, content, attractiveness and availability of communication options with e-vendors influence consumers\251 trust with commercial Websites Furthermore results highlight the importance of consumers\222 privacy in establishing a trust relationship with 
348 
348 


e-vendors. For example, 86.9% of respondents agree that a clear privacy statement on commercial Web sites alleviates their concern about using their personal information Moreover 88.5 of respondents hesitate to share their information over the Web In addition to privacy results show that security is also a determinant factor in building consumers\251 trust with e-vendors 89.1 of respondents agree that the presence of a security seal on commercial Web sites will encourage them to trust those Web sites Moreover the results show that consumers\251 experience with a certain commercial Web site will encourage them to trust that web site.  On the other hand, this study presents two types of risk that influence consumers\251 trust in EC environment Internet risk and e-vendor\222s risk For example 81.5 of respondents express that they have a fear from capturing their credit card numbers while transacting online. Moreover, 63.6% of consumers have a fear that the quality of the items that they purchased online will not be good. Furthermore, 52.7% of respondents have a fear from paying more than the real amount that they should pay Furthermore results show that 90.8 of respondents agree that their trust is positively affected by their friends\222 positive previous interactions with the same e-vendors In addition 97.7 of respondents agree that if they trust a certain commercial Web site this will positively affect their behaviour to transact online The study shows significant differences between consumers with regard to some trust factors like security and risk in the environment of EC. For example, the study shows that females are more concern than males with regard to risk in online shopping.  Furthermore, the crosstabulation of the data using respondents\222 demographic factors like nationality age gender and education show significant differences. Respondents from different regions have different opinions towards some trust factors like privacy and security in EC environment as explained above For this more future research is required to study the influence of consumers\222 demographic factors on the perceptions of trust and risk in Web commerce Furthermore a future research is needed to distinguish between trusted and high quality B2C EC Web sites VI  S TUDY LIMITATIONS  This study used a self administered questionnaire to collect the required data from different individuals in many locations and sectors in the Sultanate of Oman Although the sample of respondents encompasses individuals from different regions and nationalities the number of individuals for some nationalities and regions was small For more improvements for this study a Web-based questionnaire can be utilized to collect a supplementary data for our future research This will yield to make our results valid for a global scale VII  C ONCLUSION  This study concentrates on the importance of trust in the adoption of online transactions in B2C EC. The results show that consumers\222 evaluation of the trustworthiness of e-vendors has a significant factor that affect the trust relationship between consumers and e-vendors In addition consumers\222 satisfaction with previous interactions represented another important factor in this arena Moreover commercial Web site characteristics are considered an important domain that affects consumers trust The study shows that security and privacy are also important factors for EC trust. Moreover, the study shows that the effect of some external factors like friends on consumer\251s behaviour towards specific e-vendors is clearly evident Also the study concludes two types of risk that negatively influence consumers\251 trust in the environment of B2C EC the Internet risk and e-vendors\251 risk The crosstabulation of the collected data shows significant differences among online consumers with regard to some trust factors like privacy, risk and security R EFERENCES   1  F.N Egger Human Factors in Electronic Commerce Making Systems Appealing Usable and Trustworthy Graduate Students Consortium  Educational Symposium 12th Bled International E-Commerce Conference Bled Slovenia June 1999 2  F.N.

 By the optimizations, the DSP software pipeline of the EBC algorithm can be established. Table 5 shows the performance improvement by using the proposed EBC framework. The execution time of the proposed method is eight-time faster the original one  VI.  CONCLUSIONS  To satisfy the low-power and high image quality requirements of WMSNs, the paper studies the lowpower JPEG2000 realization on DSP-based camera node. Fixed-point LS9/7 wavelet is used instead of CDF9/7 wavelet to decrease the complexity of computation. EBC is improved for high efficient DSP parallel processing. Experiments results show that the improved JPEG2000 leads to a great reduction in implementation time, and hence saves energy consump-tion of camera nodes   ACKNOWLEDGMENT  This work is supported by the National Science Foundation of PR China \(Grant No. 60872151   REFERENCES  1] Rabbani M, Joshi R  An Overview of the JPEG2000 Still Image Compression Standard  Signal Processing: Image Communication 2002\(17  2] TMS320C64x Technical Overview, Texas Instruments, 2001  3] G.G.

Hence, each approximation space, even at the lowest resolution will contain functions that have at least one nondierentiable ?corner?. This may not be desirable Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 especially if the points of interest in the original signal happen to fall on these corners at every resolution \(for example, at the midpoint of the data set basis \(i.e., has no corners A scaling vector was developed by the author in 6] that has approximation order 4, and generates a space that contains the spline space S13\(Z is, the space of piecewise cubic polynomials that are both continuous and dierentiable at the integer knots.

Pattern Matching The premise behind using wavelets for pattern matching is that the wavelet decomposition for the pattern for which you are searching and for the pattern added to data sampled from a polynomial of degree less than the approximation order of your scaling vector will be equal. For example, the wavelet decompositions for both data sets shown in Figure 16 will be identical when using either of the bases discussed in Sections 2.2 and 2.3. It is necessary that the pattern not be in the lowest-resolution approximation space, so that it will not have a wavelet decomposition with only 0 coecients. This problem is rare, but if it occurs, it is remedied by either continuing the decomposition to an even lowerresolution space, or by using a dierent scaling vector of lower approximation order In most cases, the pattern will not be overlaid upon perfectly polynomial data, and so, the wavelet decompositions will not match exactly. However, if the pattern is prominent enough in the signal so that the root mean square error \(UPVH new decomposition {gl} when compared to the decomposition {gl } of the original pattern, as dened Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 by UPVH vuuuut QX l=1 gl  gl Q 


is suciently small, then the pattern will still be detected Figure 16: Pattern data \(top data obscured by cubic polynomial data bottom When using a single scaling function and wavelet are used in applications, each successively smoother approximation of the data stretches the support of the basis functions, eectively drawing more data from outside the region where the pattern actually occurs. By using the scaling vectors and multiwavelets mentioned in Section 2, we are able to analyze data on a bounded region, and ignore data outside of that region 3.1 When to Use Wavelets Wavelet decompositions can be used to nd patterns in any type of data, but there are no advantages to using them for exact pattern matching. For example, if searching for the word ?the? in a text le or in packet data, we have to search for the exact ASCII values 116, 104, and 101 in succession Changing those values, even by a constant amount changes the word. Also, to apply the wavelet bases mentioned in Section 2, we need 2q + 1 data values for some integer q A 1 for the DGM and the approximation-order-4 basis, and 2q+2 data values for some integer q A 1 for the basis in Section 2.3 so we would have to pad the target pattern with spaces. This type of search can be conducted much more eciently using other search methods, such as Bloom lters, etc However, for quantitative data like packet trac dependent upon time, multiwavelets have the potential to spot patterns that are not immediately noticable to the human eye, such as in the bottom graph of Figure 16. The following section gives an example of how multiwavelets can be used to detect a ?low and slow? pattern caused by data exltration 3.2 Trac Analysis Example Suppose that we have a corrupted computer and we are aware through previous experience that this particular piece of malevolent code tends to sneak? data out under the ?TCP? protocol in the following pattern a single packet of size 256 bytes, followed approximately 1 second later by another packet of size 512 bytes one second later, four packets of size 256 bytes are sent with a quarter second gap between 


the packets, and one quarter-second later, three packets of size 512 bytes are sent, followed one-quarter second later by one packet of size 256 bytes The accumulated bytes sent with respect to time in seconds are shown in Figure 17 Total Bytes Seconds Figure 17: Accumulated bytes for the example pattern The packets described above have been inserted into a set of network trac packet collected from the author?s laptop over roughly 4 minutes of usage starting at w = 240 seconds. The total accumulated outgoing bytes are illustrated in Figure 18. To apply the basis looking for this specic pattern, we Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 accumulate the bytes on quarter-second intervals and generate a wavelet decomposition for a sliding 4-second window, which is compared to the original pattern?s decomposition with the UPVH. The UPVH for the dierent starting times are shown in Figure 19. Note the low value of the UPVH at w = 240 seconds, indicating a close match to our target pattern at that time Total Bytes Seconds Figure 18: Accumulated outgoing bytes of a sample usage period plus the packets in our pattern UPVH Seconds Figure 19: UPVH values \(less than 50 blocks of data with digerent starting times Note the low value of the UPVH at w = 240 seconds, indicating a close match to our target pattern at that time In fairness, this method of nding patterns has many of the same weaknesses found in other signature-matching approaches. The pattern has to be known ahead of time, which means that this detection scheme would still be vulnerable to rst-time attacks. Also, a completely innocuous data ow occurring with very similiar timing and quantities as our pattern will still cause a low UPVH value, possibly causing a false-positive alert. We do claim 


however, that we have a greater capacity for nding patterns in quantiable amounts that are obscured by standard network trac. Also, we can adjust the sensitivity of the search without changing the signature for which we are searching, by adjusting the threshold of the UPVH?s for which an alert is issued. Thus, statistical techniques and adaptive learning can be used to help develop optimal threshold levels for a particular pattern 4. Conclusion Wavelet analysis holds an as-of-yet untapped potential for analyzing usage patterns in network trac ows, due to their ability to lter out data up to a given approximation order. Neither simple character searches nor Fourier analysis has this capability. Also, while Fourier analysis generally gives only frequency information within an analysis window, wavelet analysis gives some amount of both frequency information and the location of that frequency activity. The additional information comes at no additional computational costs, since the bases are generally applied by convolving matrix lters over the data \(repeated matrix multiplication over sliding blocks of data tiwavelet bases introduced in this document should prove to be particularly useful in pattern-matching applications, due to their short support \(that is, non-zero only over a small interval the inclusion of splines in the approximation spaces instead of just polynomials, and the ability to use them on time series with left and right boundaries The author is currently working with computer scientists at the CyberDefense Lab \(CDL at Western Kentucky University to develop software that will utilize these bases in network security, intrusion-detection, and data-extrusion applications. Once developed, we will study the eectiveness of this type of analysis in detecting malicious behavior as compared to the more commonly used techniques, with the hope of improving detection capabilities while maintaining a low false-positive rate. The software will initially be tested in the CDL?s sandbox while running attacks from its attack library with various background usage scripts being implemented, but will eventually move to less controlled network environments Acknowledments: This work supported in part by the NACMAST consortium under contract

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase.
