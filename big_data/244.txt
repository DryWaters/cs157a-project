137 1 Fuzzy Rules Extraction Using Self-Organising Neural Network and Association Rules Kok Wai Wong Tamis D Gedeon, Chun Che Fung and Patrick M Wong Abstmd Fuzzy logic is becoming popular in dealing with data analysis problems that are normally handled by statistical approaches or ANNs The major limitation is the difficulty in building the fuzzy rules from a given set of input-output data This paper proposed a 
technique to extract fuzzy rules directly from input-output pairs It uses a self-organising neural network and association rules to construct the fuzzy rule base The self-organising neural network is first used to classify the output data by realising the probability distribution of the output space Association rules are then used to find the relationships between the input space and the output classification which are subsequently converted to fuzzy rules This technique is fast and efficient The results of an illustrative example show that the fuzzy rules extracted are promising and 
useful for domain experts Index Terms Association Rules Fuzzy rules Rule extraction Self-organizing neural network I INTRODUCTION F uzzy logic FL is becoming popular in dealing with data analysis problems that are normally handled by statistical approaches or ANNs  11 In general fuzzy control systems are the most important applications of fuzzy theory This is a generalised form of expert control using fuzzy sets with fuzzy rules for 
modelling a system In classical fuzzy approaches from Zadeh 2 and Mamdani the basic idea is to calculate the conclusion by evaluating the degree of matches from the observation that triggered one or several rules in the model However, conventional FL data analysis systems do not have any learning algorithms to build the analysis model Rather K W Wong and T D Gedeon are with the School of Information Technology Murdoch University Western Australia 6150. \(telephone 618-9360-6599/-6430 e-mail  bong I

The advantages of using 
FL are the ability to handle imprecise data and to interpret the analysis model built. The data analysis model can also incorporate human knowledge by modifying the fuzzy rule base. The data analysis model can also be changed easily by modifying the fuzzy rule base The major limitation is the difficulty in building the fuzzy rules However if fuzzy rules can be extracted from measured input-output data, it will be very useful This area has attracted much attention these few years 4 5 
6 71 The usual fuzzy controller, which normally puts emphasis on the rule premises generates a large fuzzy rule base In a fuzzy rule base the number of rules depends very much on the number of inputs and the number of partitions Also the rule extraction time can be very time consuming if the input space is very large In this paper we propose an integrated use of a self organising neural network and association rules for building the fuzzy rule base Our emphasis 
is placed on the rule consequents, and we then find an association concerning the premises In this case, the partitioning of the input space is not ordinary as shown in Fig 1 thus the number of fuzzy rules does not increase exponentially with the number of inputs. The propose technique is fast and efficient in generating a fuzzy rule base x2 IEEE Catalogue No 01 CH37239 0-7803-7101-1/01/$10.00 0 2001 IEEE Fig 1 Ordinary partition of input space 403 


137 2 II SELFeRGANIZING NEURAL NETWORK Self-organising neural networks are designed with the intention to simulate the various organisations found in various brain structures and has a relationship to brain maps 8,9 Its main feature is the ability to visualise high dimensional input spaces onto a smaller dimensional display usually one or two-dimensional Self-organizing neural networks as the name suggests, have the ability to learn and organize information without being given correct outputs for the inputs Therefore, self-organising neural networks perform unsupervised learning as shown in Fig 2 Let the input data space  be mapped by the self-organising neural network onto a onedimensional array with i nodes Associated with each i node is a parametric reference vector m,=[&,M  uJT E S where H is the connection weights between node i and input j Therefore, the input data space 34 consisting of input vector X=[xl,x2,..,x,JT i.e X E  can be visualised as being connected to all nodes in parallel via a scalar weights H The aim of the learning is to map all the n input vectors Xn onto mi by adjusting weights such that the self-organising neural network gives the best match response locations n Fig 2 Self-organising Neural Network A self-organising neural network can also be said to be a nonlinear projection of the probability density fimctionp\(X of the high dimensional input vector space onto the one or two dimensional display map Normally to find the best matching node i the input vector Xis compared to all reference vectors by searching for the smallest Euclidean distances 11 X mi 11 signified by e Therefore or During the learning process the node that best matches the input vector Xis allowed to learn as well as those nodes that are close to the node up to a certain distance The learning process is expressed as where t is discrete time coordinate and hei\(t is the neighbourhood function After the learning process has converged the map will display the probability density function p\(3 that best describes all the input vectors At be end of the learning process an average quantisation error of the map will be generated to indicate how well the map matches the entire input vectorsX The average quantisation error is defined as Beside the average quantisation error an individual quantisation error is also used to measure how well the input vector matches the closest node i m ASSOCIATION RULES Since data mining is a process of discovering useful and interesting knowledge  101 this paper explores the application of association rules  1 11 in finding the relationship between the input and output space In other words we proposed to use an association model to discover knowledge that exists in the relationship between input variables for the inference of the output variable Such knowledge will be used for extracting the fuzzy rules that best describe the relationship between the input and output where X and Yare set ofitemsZ il,i2  in such thatXcZ YcZ and X n Y  0 Each association rule X Yhas a confidence c if c of transactions in a database that containXalso contain Y The support s of a rule X Y means s of transactions in the database contain XU Y Association rules can provide useful information about a database that cannot be done by using SQL However, the algorithm for finding the association rules may be time consuming if it requires multiple passes over the available data lo In this paper we make use of a faster algorithm  which uses only two full scans to find the association rules As this algorithm is normally used to find association rules from categorical attributes it is modified with the concept in 13 to use for quantitative attributes for this fuzzy rules extraction technique An association rule can be expressed as X  Iv FUZZY RULES EXTRACTION A Clustering Output Space In a given data set, with k inputs, the given input-output data pairs with n patterns are xi  x  x    x  y i  5 where i  1,2,3  n 404 


137 3 For our application, only one dimensional output projection is  used The assumption made here is one output neuron represents one cluster After all the unsupervised learning of the self-organising neural network has been completed, the min-max values of the data in the cluster c are used as the boundary values of the class Itemset support  Age 20..29  3  Age 30..39  2  Married Yes  3  Married No  2  NumCars O..P  3  Age 30..39   kried Yes  2 where I=I 2 3  i and i  the number of data in c cluster B Finding Association in Input Space C Determining Fuzzy Memberships Until this stage, all the clusters we have obtained are crisp clusters with only upper Uand lower L values, and association rules that look like the following Temp 35..39 and Wind speed 0..10  Weather hoe Before the information from the output cluster can be used In stage all the crisp have to be converted to fuzzy membership sets. Only triangular membership functions in this stage they need to be converted to a label B are used as a start because they are less computationally complex and are used widely in real-time implementations In most fuzzy inference system with fuzziness crossing at 0.5 i cut, the values cutting below 0.5 become less and less true in that fuzzy set Here we propose the conversion as follows  B 8 In this case, equation 5 can be re-written as x:,xi,x  x;;B,\(y 9 Refer to Fig 4 for notations used where i  1,2,3  n The first step of searching association rules is to find the appropriate partitions and the number of intervals The equi depth partitioning is used as it is optimal for partial completeness  131 The number of intervals in the partition is determined as follows The properties that use to decide the number of intervals are based on the rule of partial completeness level K It is known that the minimum confidence must be set to 1/K times the desired level to guarantee that close rules will be generated The number of intervals required can be calculated by the formula Fig 4 Notations used in the fuzzy set The lower boundary value of the cluster is assigned to the 10 where k is the number of quantitative attributes 2k No of Intervals m\(K 1 point where the left flank cuts at 0.5 Ccut HLF m is the minimum support \(as a fraction\specified HLF L 1 1 by the user 405 


137 4 It is the same for the right flank of the fuzzy membership function. The point where &cut is 0.5 HRF is assigned to the upper boundary value of the cluster For the left flank and the left core of the trapezoidal membership function it takes the values of the left flank and the left core of the triangular membership function of AI HW=U 12 LFTP  LFAl 16 The core of the fuzzy membership function is taken as the LcTP CO 17 average of the upper and the lower boundary values For the right side of the trapezoidal membership function it can be calculated similar to the left side by taking the m+HRF 2 CO  13 information from the A2 instead of AI Then the left and right flanks of the fuzzy membership RFTP  RF function finishes at the following points RCTP  CO 19 LF  HLF  CO-HLF 14 RF  HRF  HRF CO v ILLUSTRATION EXAMPLE An illustrative example is used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed fuzzy rules extraction technique The nonlinear two input one output system with the following equation was used. The nonlinear function is shown in Fig 6 D Constructing Fuzzy Rules F the association rules and the membership functions constructed in the previous two stages we can construct the following relation y  1+x;\222 x;l.5  1 I 3  x I 5 20 A x  A BW\222 16 From the above relation a fuzzy rule can be constructed as ifxl is AI and x2 is A2 then y is B However the fuzzy memberships that are found to be next to each other can be merged to form a trapezoidal fuzzy membership function Both trapezoidal and triangular functions have the same computational efficiency and are commonly used in most real time applications The triangular fuzzy membership function can be merged to form a trapezoidal function as follows, and shown in Fig 5 Fig 5 Merging neighbouring membership functions Fifty data points were used to extract the fuzzy rules to model the above nonlinear system First the self-organizing neural network was used to cluster the outputy It was started from 4 clusters and then incremented one at a time The increment was stopped when the minimum support for a cluster was 10 and the maximum support for a cluster was 30 This meant stopping at 5 clusters in this example When looking for association rules the minimum support was set to 20 minimum confidence level to 25 and the maximum support to 30 The K value was selected to be 5 The number of partitions was then calculated as 5 Association rules were then extracted from the data Fuzzy membership functions were constructed based on the merged partitions, if there were any With the association rules and the membership functions a total of 14 fuzzy rules were constructed. The 14 fuzzy rules extracted are shown in Fig 7 Correlation factor and mean square error were used to measure the accuracy of the fuzzy model The correlation factor is 0.887 and the mean square error is 0.253 The output plots of the predicted results and the actual output is shown in Fig 8 and their cross plot is shown in Fig 9 This model is considered to be a reasonably good model of the original nonlinear system based on equation 20 If some forms of parameter identification can be incorporated the accuracy will be improved further This is out of the scope of this paper 406

With the set of association rules and the fuzzy membership functions fuzzy rules are then extracted Our emphasis is put on the rule consequents and then finds an association conceming the premises This has overcome the major problem of using fuzzy models which is rule explosion. The size of the fuzzy rules in our technique is not increased exponentially with the increase of input variables and the membership functions As the time taken by the self organising neural network and the data-mining algorithm is fast fuzzy rules can be extracted in a short period of time Our illustration example has also shown that fuzzy rules extracted by this technique can be used to model nonlinear system with accurate prediction results ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This research is supported by the Australian Research council REFERENCES Wong K.W Gedeon T.D Fung C.C 223Using Modified Alpha-cut Based Fuzzy Interpolation in Petrophysical Properties Prediction,\224 Proceedings of the 4-th Japan-Australia Joint Workshop on Intelligent and Evolutionary Systems October 2000 Japan pp Zadeh L.A 223Outline of a new approach to the analysis of complex systems and decision processes,\224 ZEEE Transactions on System Man and Cybernetics pp 28-44 1973 Mamdani E.H and Assilian S 223An experiment in linguistic synthesis with a fuzzy logic contoller,\224 International Journal of Man-Machine Studies pp 1-13, 1975 Wang L.X and Mendel J.M 223Generating fuzzy rules by learning from examples,\224 ZEEE Transactions on System Man and Cybernetics vol 22 no 6 pp 1414-1427 1992 Chiy S.L 223Fuzzy model identification based on cluster estimation,\224 Journal ofzntelligent Fuzzy System vol 2 pp 267-218 1994 Abe S and Lan M S 223A method for fuzzy rules extraction directly from numerical data and its application to pattern classification,\224 ZEEE Transactions of Fuzzy System vol 3 pp 18 28, 1995 Thawonmas R and Abe S 223Function Approximation Based on Fuzzy Rules Extracted from Partitioned Numerical Data,\224 ZEEE Transaction on Systems Man and Cybernetics  Part B Cybernetics vol 29 no 3 pp 525-534 1999 Kohonen T Self-organization and Associative Memory 3rd Edition, Springer-Verlag, Berlin 1989 Kohonen, T. \221The Self-Organising Map,\224 Proceedings of the ZEEE 136-142,2000 Vol 78 NO 9 pp 1464-1480 1990 lo Fayyad U M Piatetsky-Shapiro G and Smyth P 223From Data Mining to Knowledge Discovery An Overview,\224 Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining ed Fayyad U Piatetsky-Shapiro G Smyth P Uthurusamy R The AAAUMIT Press, Menlo Park Califomidcambridge Massachusetts pp 1-34 1996  111 Agrawal R Mannila H Srikant R Toivonen H and Verkamo A I 223Fast Discovery of Association Rules,\224 Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining ed Fayyad U Piatetsky-Shapiro G Smyth P Uthurusamy R AAAUMIT Press, pp 307-328 1996 12 Savasere A Omiecinski E and Navathe S 1995 223An Efficient Algorithm for Mining Association Rules in Large Databases,\224 Proceedings of the 21\224 International Conference on Very Large Data Bases VLDB\22295 pp 432-444 1995 13 Srikant R and Agrawal R 1996 223Mining Quantitative Association Rules in Large Relational Tables,\224 Proceedings of ACM SZGMOD Conference on Management of Data Montreal Canada pp 1-12 408

The data flows in continuously and is processed daily Mining association rules dynamically has the following benefits 267  223Real-time\224 data mining, that is, the rules are drawn from the latest transactions for reflecting the current commercial trends 267  Multilevel knowledge abstraction, which requires summarizing multiple partial results. For example association rules on the month or year basis cannot be concluded from daily mining results. In fact multilevel mining is incremental in nature 267  For scalability, incremental and distributed mining has become a practical choice Figure 3: Distributed rule mining Incremental association rule mining requires combining partial results. It is easy to see that the confidence and support of multiple rules may not be combined directly. This is why we treat them as \223views\224 and only maintain the association cube, the population cube and the base cube that can be updated from each new copy of volume cube. Below, we discuss several cases to show how a GDOS can mine association rules by incorporating the partial results computed at LDOSs 267  The first case is to sum up volume-cubes generated at multiple LDOSs. Let C v,i be the volume-cube generated at LDOS i The volume-cube generated at the GDOS by combining the volume-cubes fed from these LDOSs is 345   n i i v v C C 1  The association rules are then generated at the GDOS from the centralized C v  214  The second case is to mine local rules with distinct bases at participating LDOSs, resulting in a local association cube C a,I a local population cube C p,I  and a local base cube C b,i at each LDOS. At the GDOS, multiple association cubes, population cubes and base cubes sent from the LDOSs are simply combined, resulting in a summarized association cube and a summarized population cube, as 345   n i i a a C C 1   345   n i i p p C C 1  and 345   n i i b b C C 1  The corresponding confidence cube and support cube can then be derived as described earlier. Cross-sale association rules generated from distinct customers belong to this case In general, it is inappropriate to directly combine association cubes that cover areas a 1 205, a k to cover a larger area a In the given example, this is because association cubes record counts of customers that satisfy   customer product merchant time area Doe TV Dept Store 98Q1 California Doe VCR Dept Store 98Q1 California customer product merchant time area Doe VCR Sears 5-Feb-98 San Francisco Joe PC OfficeMax 7-Feb-98 San Francisco customer product merchant time area Doe TV Fry's 3-Jan-98 San Jose Smith Radio Kmart 14-Jan-98 San Jose Association   population      base          confidence      support cube               cube                cube         cube                cube LDOS LDOS GDOS 


the association condition, and the sets of customers contained in a 1 205, a k are not mutually disjoint. This can be seen in the following examples 214  A customer who bought A and B in both San Jose and San Francisco which are covered by different LDOSs , contributes a count to the rule covering each city, but has only one count, not two, for the rule A  336  B covering California 214  A customer \(e.g. Doe in Figure 3\who bought a TV in San Jose, but a VCR in San Francisco, is not countable for the cross-sale association rule TV  336 VCR covering any of these cities, but countable for the rule covering California. This is illustrated in Figure 3 6  Conclusions In order to scale-up association rule mining in ecommerce, we have developed a distributed and cooperative data-warehouse/OLAP infrastructure. This infrastructure allows us to generate association rules with enhanced expressive power, by combining information of discrete commercial activities from different geographic areas, different merchants and over different time periods. In this paper we have introduced scoped association rules  association rules with conjoint items and functional association rules as useful extensions to association rules The proposed infrastructure has been designed and prototyped at HP Labs to support business intelligence applications in e-commerce. Our preliminary results validate the scalability and maintainability of this infrastructure, and the power of the enhanced multilevel and multidimensional association rules. In this paper we did not discuss privacy control in customer profiling However, we did address this issue in our design by incorporating support for the P3P protocol [1 i n  ou r data warehouse. We plan to integrate this framework with a commercial e-commerce system References 1  Sameet Agarwal, Rakesh Agrawal, Prasad Deshpande Ashish Gupta, Jeffrey F.
