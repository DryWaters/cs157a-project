Discovering Association Strength among Brand Loyalties from Purchase History Yukinobu Hamuro\222 Naoki Katoh\222 Katsutoshi Yada3 Dept of Business Administration Osaka Sangyo Univ Daito Osaka 574-8530 JAPAN Dept of Architecture and Architectural Systems Kyoto University Kyoto 606-8501 JAPAN Faculty of Commerce, Kansai University Suita 564-8680 JAPAN 222 Abstract Analyzing purchase history of customers enables us to discover valuable knowledge that is helpful for develop ing effective sales promotion In this respect we shall introduce a new notion association strength among 
brand loyalties, which is defined for every ordered pair of brands If the association strength between loyalties of brands A and B is high it represents that purchase of brand A is highly correlated to that of brand B Conventional method for discovering associative pur chasing is usually applied for one purchase opportunity one receipt i.e., it reveals how often two commodities are purchased at the same time On the other hand we are interested in discovering relationship among cus tomers\222 loyalties to certain brands or manufacturers by investigating long-term purchase history 
of customers By computing association strengths from customers\222 purchase history of drugstore chain in Japan we could produce several interesting rules that will be useful for sales promotion planning 1 Introduction According to the rapid development of modern com puter technologies there has been much progress made in automating daily office work This in turn has re sulted in the accumulation of a huge amount of business data into databases However it does not seem that most companies can make full use of such accumulated data 
for strategic planning of their future business On the other hand knowledge discovery zn databases or data mzning has become an active research area in which new technologies or methodologies are sought to automatically extract meaningful knowledge from busi ness data l 7 81 One of the fundamental techniques in data mining is association de A typical application of association rule is to discover rules of associative purchasing by analyzing data accumulated from POS\(point of sales terminals For supermarkets or drugstores 
customers purchase several items at one time By investigating receipts issued by POS terminals we can find how often two commodities are purchased at the same time This information for instance helps to construct effective location of commodities in a store If purchase history of customers are available we can discover much more valuable knowledge that can be helpful for constructing effective marketing strategy 2 3 5 41 For instance we can measure brand loyalty or for customers who are loyal to a certain brand we can find to what 
brands in other commodity categories such customers have loyalty Such information can be used in promotion sales planning such as effective cross-sell In this respect we shall introduce a new notion as soczatzon strength among brand loyalties which is de fined for every ordered pair of brands If the association strength of brand A to brand B is high it represents that loyalties of brands A and B are highly correlated Conventional method for discovering associative pur chasing is usually applied for one purchase opportunity one receipt i.e it reveals 
how often two commodities are purchased at the same time On the other hand we are interested in finding correlation between loyalties of two brands If customers with high loyalty to a brand A in category C are usually loyal to other brand B in category D it indicates that there exists some reason behind such phenomenon Such correlation provides us with useful customer knowledge For example if both brands are made by the same manufacturer we can infer that there may exist high loyalty to the manu 
facturer If manufacturers of brands A and B are dif ferent although the manufacturer of brand A produces brand B\222 which belongs to the same category as that of brand B This indicates that the manufacturer of brands A and B\222 should carry out effective sales pro motion so as to increase the number of customers who purchase both A and B\222 In this manner by computing 12 61 0-7803-70Wo-21011$10.00 0 2001 IEEE 114 ISIE 2001 Pusan KOREA 


association strengths of brand loyalties we can mea sure relationships of brand powers among commodities that belong to various commodity categories by which manufacturers can understand which brands are cor related or not correlated with which brands of other manufacturers We have carried out computational experiments by using customers purchase history of drugstore chain in Japan in order to observe whether we can produce interesting rules that will be useful for developing ef fective sales promotion The organization of this paper is as follows Sec tion 2 rigorously defines association strength and Sec tion 3 reports computational experiments Section 4 concludes the paper and mentions future research 2 Association Strength among Brands in Purchase History customer 2 customer 3 total Suppose that there are two commodity categories say, laundry detergent category L and dish-washing detergent category D and that there are three manu facturers MI Mz M3 each of which produce one brand in both categories Let A and B for each i  1,2,3 denote the brands in categories C and ID respectively which are produced by manufacturer M Suppose also that there are three customers who bought brands A and B in their purchase history Table 1 shows the number of items of each brand purchased by customers 15 4 1 20 10 3 3 16 5 14 11 30 2 20 15 37 30 20 15 65 32 25 20 77 Table 1 An example used to explain association strength category L category V A1 I Az I A3 1 total B1 I B2 I B3 I total customer 1 11 10 I 2 I 3 I 15 I1 20 I 2 I 2 I 24 From this table we observe that customers 1 and 2 have rather high loyalty to brands A1 and B1 while customer 3 is not loyal to any of these brands For cus tomer 1 assuming that the numbers of items of cate gories C and D which he/she purchases are the same notice from Table 1 that such numbers are different i.e 15 C items and 24 D items let us consider the conditional probability PI B1 I AI representing how many items of brand B1 the customer purchases per purchase of one item of brand Al Here the subscript 1 of PI stands for the customer number It is natu ral to regard that Pl\(B1 I AI is independent of A1 since the only information available is Table 1 That is Pl\(B1 I AI  Pl\(B1 which is equal to his/her brand share in category D  20/24 Now reflecting that the total number of items of categories L and V are 15 and 24, 10 items of brand A1 out of 15 category C items are purchased by customer 1 we consider that the customer 1 purchased 10.24/15  16 D items in association with the purchases of 10 C items Among 16 D items 16  Pl\(B1  13.33 items is expected to be of brand B1 Thus, it is reasonable to consider that 13.33 B1 items have been purchased in association with brand Al Seeing the last row Table 1 you may naturally consider that for the average customer the conditional probability Paue\(B1 I AI is equal to Pave\(B1  32/77 However it does not seem to suitably reflect the overall purchase behaviour because there is a positive correla tion of the purchase of A1 and that of B1 as seen from Table 1 Then what is the best estimated value of Paue\(B1 I AI We shall define it as the the value x that minimizes the squared error from P,\(B1 weighted by the purchase frequency i.e x is computed as the solution of where i ranges over all customers a,\(Al and P,\(B1 denote the number of items of brand A1 purchased by customer i and the brand share of customer i for B1 and a,\(L resp a,\(D denotes the ratio of the number of C resp 2 commodity purchased by customer i to the total sales volume of commodities of C resp D It is easy to see that c az\(Al dP Bi x  c az\(A1  Such z is denoted by Paue\(B1 1 Al expected condi tional purchase probability of B1 with respect to AI is defined as Association strength of A1 on B1 denoted by as\(A1 B1 as\(A1 B1  z*/share\(Bl where share\(B1 denotes the share of B1 in category D F'rom Table 1 as\(A1,Bl  0.622/0.416  1.50 In the same manner We can compute as\(A B3 for all i and j and we can also can compute as A3 for all i and j Intuitively if as\(A,,B  1 brand loyalties 115 ISIE 2001 Pusan KOREA 


n Baby Diaper Total Score 10.05 Fig 1 A triple of brands that attain the highest score of A and B are positively correlated otherwise it is negatively correlated We can extend the notion of association strength to a Ic-tuple of brands which are all belong to distinct commodity category It is defined simply as the sum of association strengths for all ordered pair of brands 3 Computational Experiments In order to observe whether we can obtain interest ing rules by computing association strengths we per form computational experiments using POS data accu mulated in drugstore chain in Japan 3 Our experi ments used 252,761 customers and 750 categories The average number of brands per category is 15 Because the space limit we only give two interesting results 1 For every triple of categories and for every triple of brands each from distinct category we have com puted association strengths One of the brand triples that attained highest score is illustrated in Fig.1 The corresponding thrce categories are baby diaper san itary napkin for regular use and sanitarymapkin for night use Brands shown in the figure are those whose prices are relatively low and frequently sold at discount price We may see that customers who are loyal to these brands are loyal to their prices but not to brands 2 We did a similar experiment for 5-tuple of cat0 gories as shown in Table 2 a b and c in parentheses stand for manufacturers Three tuples of brands are those which attain highest scores among all combina tions of brands in this set of five categories As seen from Table 2 the second tuple indicates that there are certain fraction of customers who are loyal to brands all from manufacturer b The other two tuples indicate that manufacturers a and c are not strong in category of liquid laundry detergent This may be useful infor mation for these two manufacturers 4 Conclusion and Future Work In this paper we have introduced a new notion as sociation strength among brand loyalties From com putational experiments using real POS data of drug store chain we found interesting rules that can be use ful in future promotion sales planning We are plan ning to carry out further computational experiments using various POS data in order to see how association strengths among brand and manufacturer loyalties can be utilized in sales promotion planning of real business References l R AGRAWAL T IMIELINSKLAND A SWAMI Database mining A performance perspective IEEE Transac tions on Knowledge and Data Engineering 5 1993 pp 914-925 2 Katsuki Fujisawa Yukinobu Hamuro Naoki Katoh Takeshi Tokuyama, and Katsutoshi Yada Approxima tion of Optimal Two-Dimensional Association Rules for Categorical Attributes Using Semidefinite Pro gramming Proc of 2nd Symp on Discovery Science LNAI 1721 Springer-Verlag 148-159, 1999 31 Y Hamuro N Katoh Y Matsuda and K Yada Mining Pharmacy Data Helps to Make Profits Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery V01.2 No.4 1998 4 Hamuro Y Katoh N and Yada K Discover ing Interpretable Rules that Explain Customer Brand Choice Behavior INFORMS-KORMS Seoul 2000 pp.561-568 June 2000 5 Ip E Yada K Hamuro, Y., and Katoh N A Data Mining System for Managing Customer Relationship Proceedings of the 2000 Americas Conference on In formation Systems, August 2000 pp.101-105 6 Kitts B Freed D and Vrieze M Cross-sell A Fast Promotion-?Anable Customer-item Recommendation Method Based on Conditionally Independent Proba bilities, Proc KDD 2000 pp 437-446, Aug 2000 7  G PIATETSKY-SHAPIRO \(Editor Knowledge Dis covery in Databases AAA1 Press 1991 8 R UTHURUSAMY U.M FAYYAD AND s SPANGLER Learning Useful Rules from Inconclusive Data In 7 9 Yada, K Hamuro Y and Katoh N The Discovery of Customer Loyalty from Newcomers Proceeding of 2000 MIS/OA International Conference pp.185-189 June 2000 pp.391-398   pp 141-157 1991 116 ISIE 2001 Pusan KOREA

single bond  aromatic bond single bOnd  aromatic bDnd d CBO Figure 9 Two fragments extracted from a sei of steroids On the left, single and aromatic bonds were treated as different bond types. on the right they were treated as the same bond type 3.4 Treatment of Aromatic Bonds An important aspect of molecular fragment mining is the treatment of aromatic rings Since ammaticity is not clearly defined and can be modeled differently i.e explicit aro matic bonds vs alternating single and double bonds it is desirable to be able to take it into account throughout the mining process itself We achieve this by modeling aro matic bonds as either single or double bonds with a flag that indicates aromaticity This allows us to choose to ignore this flag during mining and hence to find fragments that contain either aromatic or single resp double bonds The following example illustrates why this is desirable Using a small set of steroid compounds we derived frag ments that occur in ail of them support=100%\using the standard algorithm Figure 9 left shows the correspond ing fragment Note how only two rings with an incomplete third ring are discovered of the four ring structure that is typical for steroids However if we model aromatic bonds as single+flag and allow the algorithm to ignore this flag the resulting fragment contains all four rings see Figure 9 right For some steroids this fourth ring consists of sin gle bonds while others have an aromatic ring at this posi tion However most chemists still regard this as the same 4 ring structure Such selective 223tolerance\224 against some mis matches can therefore make the presented algorithm more useful for real applications 4 Conclusions We presented an algorithm to find relevant molecular frag ments in large chemical structure databases The algorithm allows us to focus on fragments that help to discriminate be tween different classes of molecules The underlying search method, which is based on a depth first search with struc tural pruning makes it possible to find such fragments effi ciently without the need for frequent reembeddings of frag ment candidates, which is a known problem of previously reponed approaches We have shown how the proposed method finds relevant fragments using data from a well known HIV-screening compound database The extracted fragments successfully model several of the activity classes known for this dataset Future work will focus on making the presented approach more meaningful for the underlying application In partic ular finding fragments that match exactly is not of prime interest to chemists As demonstrate above some types of ring structures are considered functionally equivalent which should be taken into account by the search algorithm as well We are currently exploring ways to include such 223fuzziness\224 into the underlying search algorithm directly References I R Agrawal T Imielienski and A Swami.

The execution time of the HPA program pass 2 is shown in figure 13 as the number of PCs is changed The maximum number of PCs used in this evaluation is 100 Reasonably good speedup is achieved in this application as the number of PCs is increased 5 Conclusion In this paper we presented performance evaluation of parallel database processing on an ATM connected 100 node PC cluster system The latest PCs enabled us to obtain over 110Mbps throughput in point-to-point communication on a 155Mbps ATM network even with the so-called 217\217heavy\220\220 TCP/IP This greatly helped in developing the system in a short period since we were absorbed in fixing many other problems Massively parallel computers now tend to be used in business applications as well as the conventional scientific computation Two major business applications decision support query processing and data mining were picked up and executed on the PC cluster The query processing environment was built using the results of our previous research the super database computer SDC project Performace evaluation results with a query of the standard TPC-D benchmark showed that our system achieved superior performance especially when transposed file organization was employed As for data mining we developed a parallel algorithm for mining association rules and implemented it on the PC cluster By utilizing aggregate memory of the system efficiently the system showed good speedup characteristics as the number of nodes increased The good price/performance ratio makes PC clusters very attractive and promising for parallel database processing applications All these facts support the effectiveness of the commodity PC based massively parallel database servers Acknowledgment This project is supported by NEDO New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization in Japan Hitachi Ltd technically helped us extensively for ATM related issues References  R Agrawal T Imielinski and A Swami Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases In Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data  pages 207--216 1993  R Agrawal and R Srikant Fast algorithms for mining association rules In Proceedings of International Conference on Very Large Data Bases  1994  A C Arpaci-Dusseau R H Arpaci-Dusseau D E Culler J M Hellerstein and D A Patterson High-performance sorting on Networks of Workstations In Proceedings of International Conference on Management of Data  pages 243--254 1997  D.S Batory On searching transposed files ACM TODS  4\(4 1979  P.A Boncz W Quak and M.L Kersten Monet and its geographical extensions A novel approach to high performance GIS processing In Proceedings of International Conference on Extending Database Technology  pages 147--166 1996 15 Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE SC97 Conference \(SC\22297 0-89791-985-8/97 $ 17.00 \251 1997 IEEE

wording as follows more knowledgeable in operation and hazards associated with electric power generation transmission and/or distribution equipment Recommends that OSHA add a definition for the word practicable and replace the word feasible with practicable wherever it appears in the proposed regulations and that practicable be further defined as capable of being accomplished by reasonably available and economic means OTHER ISSUES Clothing OSHA requested comments on the advisability of adopting requirements regarding the clothing worn by electric utility industry employees EEI has presented comments which indicates research is underway prior to establishing a standard for clothing to be worn by electric utility employees However EEI's position is that this standard has not developed to the extent that it could be included in the OSHA Rules Both APPA and EEI state that they would support a requirement that employers train employees regarding the proper type of clothing to wear to minimize hazards when working in the vicinity of exposed energized facilities Grandfathering Due to the anticipated cost impact on the utility industry of the proposed Rules requiring that existing installations be brought to the requirements of the proposed Rules both APPA and EEI propose that the final Rules include an omnibus grandfather provision This provision would exempt those selected types of facilities from modification to meet the new rules EEI states that if the grandfathering concept is incorporated that electric utility employees will not be deprived of proper protection They propose that employers be required to provide employees with a level of protection equivalent to that which the standard would require in those instances in which the utility does not choose to modify existing facilities to comply with the final standard Rubber Sleeves OSHA requests comments from the industry on whether it would be advisable to require rubber insulating sleeves when gloves are used on lines or equipment energized at more than a given voltage EEI states its position that utilities should continue to have the option of choosing rubber gloves or gloves and sleeves to protect employees when it is necessary to work closer to energized lines than the distances specified in the clearance tables Preemuting State Laws EEI requests that the final Rules be clear in their preempting state rules applicable to the operation and maintenance work rules for electric power systems. This is especially critical since some states now have existing laws which are more stringent than the proposed OSHA Rules Examples are 1 in California and Pennsylvania where electric utility linemen are prohibited from using rubber gloves to work on lines and equipment energized at more than certain voltages and 2 in California and Connecticut where the live line bare hand method of working on high voltage transmission systems is prohibited One utility Pacific Gas  Electric has obtained a variance from the California OSHA to perform live line bare-hand transmission maintenance work on an experimental basis Coiiflicts Between the Rilles and Part 1926 Subpart V Since many of the work procedures in construction work and operation and maintenance work are similar and difficult to distinguish between EEI requests that the final order be clear in establishing which rule has jurisdiction over such similar work areas A2-19 v 


IMPACTS ON COSTS AND ASSOCIATED BENEFITS In its introduction to the proposed rules OSHA has provided an estimate of the annual cost impact on the electric utility industry for the proposed des of approximately 20.7 million OSHA estimates that compliance with this proposed standard would annually prevent between 24 and 28 fatalities and 2,175 injuries per year The utilities which have responded to this proposed standard through their respective associations have questioned the claims both of the magnitude of the cost involved and the benefit to the industry in preventing fatalities and lost-time injuries Both EEI and APPA feel that the annual cost which OSHA estimates are significantly lower than would be realized in practice Factors which APPA and EEI feel were not properly addressed include the following OSHA has not accurately accounted for cost of potential retroactive impacts including retrofitting and modifying existing installations and equipment OSHA has not consistently implemented performance based provisions in proposed rules  many portions require specific approaches which would require utilities to replace procedures already in place with new procedures Estimates were based on an average size investor-owned utility of 2,800 employees and an average rural cooperative of 56 employees, which are not applicable to many smaller systems such as municipal systems OSHA has not adequately addressed the retraining which would be necessary with modifying long-established industry practices to be in accordance with the OSHA rules EEI claims that OSHA's proposed clearance requirements would not allow the use of established maintenance techniques for maintaining high voltage transmission systems and thus would require new techniques For an example of the cost which is estimated to be experienced as a result of the new Rules one of the EEI member companies has estimated that approximately 20,000 transmission towers would need to be modified to accommodate the required step bolts in the Rules at an estimated cost of 6,200,000 Additionally this same company estimates that the annual cost of retesting live line tools for its estimated 1,000 tools would be 265,000 Additionally, both EEI and APPA question the additional benefits which OSHA claims would result from implementation of the new Rules APPA questions the estimates of preventing an additional 24 to 28 fatalities annually and 2,175 injuries per year in that it fails to account for the fact that the industry has already implemented in large part safety measures which are incorporated in the Rules EEI and APPA also point out that many preventable injuries cannot be eliminated despite work rules enforcement and safety awareness campaigns since many such accidents which result in fatalities are due to employee being trained but not following the employer's training and policies PRESENT STATUS OF RULES According to information received from the OSHA office in February 1993 the final Rules are to be published no later than July 1993 and possibly as soon as March 1993 OSHA closed their receipt of comments in March 1991 and no further changes in the rules are thought possible A2-20 


CONCLUSION The OSHA 1910.269 which proposes to cover electric utility operation and maintenance work rules affects a multitude of working procedures as are summarized in this paper It is not possible at the present time to assess the final structure of the Rules as may be proposed in 1993 or subsequent years Since the comments from the utility associations APPA and EEI were made following the initial release of the proposed OSHA Rules in 1989 a significant amount of time has elapsed where other events have occurred which may affect the form of the final Rules The 1993 NESC went into effect in August 1992 and includes some of the requirements to which the commenters objected For example a significant requirement in the Part 4 of the 1993 NESC requires that rubber gloves be utilized on exposed energized parts of facilities operating at 50 to 300 volts This requirement is in conflict with EEl\222s proposed change to the OSHA Rules which would still allow working such secondary facilities without the use of rubber gloves Electric utilities are advised to review the January 31 1989 proposed operation and maintenance Rules as summarized in this paper and to review their procedures which would be affected by application of the Rules Many of the procedures proposed in the Rules provide valuable guidance in electric utilities\222 operation and maintenance activities Where the cost impact is not significant, it is recommended that utilities consider implementing such procedures in expectation of the Rules being published in the next few months Also it would be appropriate for electric utilities to review the 1993 edition of the NESC since there are portions of the Rules which have resulted in changes in the NESC These changes mainly occur in Part 4 Rules for the Operation of Electric Supply and Communications Lines and Equipment The concerns which the commenters have addressed regarding the cost impact and the resulting benefits experienced as a result of the promulgation of the Rules are real ones and must be addressed in the final Rules As a result this paper cannot present a conclusion regarding the full impact of the Rules The development of such Rules continue to be an ongoing matter and will undoubtedly require later analysis when the final rules are published A2-21
