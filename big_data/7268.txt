The probabilistic fracture behavior of glass is complex, and dependent on many variables.  Typically, to avoid such complexity, overly simplistic strength estimates are employed that fail to take advantage of well understood glass properties.  Such a simple approach requires the use of conservative strength values 
that encompass the weakest possible cases.  This results in optic designs that, while robust, are unnecessarily massive and display excess wavefront error and instability, threatening mission viability This paper presents a complete approach to glass strength analysis, as compiled from existing literature, incorporating both the principles of fracture mechanics and details of the specific design in question The mathematical formulae needed to accurately predict fa ilure rates of individual glass components using laboratory data are presented The result is a method of analys is that accurately represents our understanding of fracture and uses known information about the specific mechanical design. By replacing conservative strength values with detailed, application specific survival forecasts, e ngineers gain greater design 
freedom.  Optic mass and performance can be more effectively optimized, improving instrument performance 12   T ABLE OF C ONTENTS  N OMENCLATURE 1  1  I NTRODUCTION 1  2  F RACTURE AND THE W EIBULL D ISTRIBUTION 2  3  C HARACTERIZATION OF GLASS

NTRODUCTION  The Jet Propulsion Laboratory\222s \(JPL\222s\general practice regarding the strength of glass is to assume an ultimate strength of 13.8 MPa \(2000 psi\s simplistic approach fails to account for material or application differences Imagine having to design metal components assuming that all metals have the same yield strength; to prevent failure of any components, the yield strength value would be determined by the weakest metal and applied to all other metals.  Engineers would be forced toward overly conservative designs to keep induced stresses within the strength limits of the weakest metal, regardless of the true strength of the material Our current approach for glass strength analysis is causing the same problem.  While the origin of the strength value is 
unclear, we can assume that it corresponds to some sort of 223worst case\224 situation.  To date, no flight glass component has failed when designed using 13.8 MPa as the ultimate strength However, as missions become increasingly complex and require greater precision, the strength value is becoming a key design constraint.  For example, the SIM project has wavefront stability requirement s on optical surfaces at the nanometer level.  To achieve such performance, the optics must be as isolated from dist urbances \(generally thermally induced\as possible.  The amount of isolation is limited by the glass strength.  To meet conservative allowables adhesive area and glass volume are increased.  This results in less athermalization, increasing thermal strains and

To meet performance requirements, several of the SIM optics will need to withstand launch stresses approximately 2x that allowed by the current ultimate strength when the appropriate factors of safety are applied.  Reducing launch stresses to the usual 13.8MPa allowable level would compromise instrument performance.  Though engineers understand that the current limit is overly conservative and the component could likely withstand higher stresses, they lack a more comprehensive method to evaluate failure risk for glasses This paper describes a complete approach to probabilistic glass strength analysis, summarized from existing papers, to incorporate both the principles of fracture mechanics and the details of the specific design in question. The result is more accurate failure analysis.  Conservatism will be greatly decreased by making use of our understanding of the mechanics and environment Application specific survival forecasts give engineers increased design capability improving instrument performance. Missions previously thought beyond capability will become possible 2  F RACTURE AND THE W EIBULL D ISTRIBUTION  Glass failure occurs when fl aws within the material are stressed to the point of uncontrolled growth.  Many different sized flaws will exist on a given component whose strength will be determined by the most severe   This is because fr acture follows the \223weakest link\224 principl m eani ng t h at t h e ent i r e com ponent fai l s  when the weakest piece fails. Typically, the strength limiting flaws are on the surface of the glass, introduced during the machining process. The various flaw sizes which are distributed across the glass result in a distribution of strengths.  Some components w ill contain a large flaw and exhibit reduced strength, while other components will have small flaws and exhibit high strength.  Thus, a distribution is used to describe the probabilistic strength of a glass component.  For a given applied stress, the glass has a corresponding probability of surv ival/failure.  Conversely to achieve a desired probability of survival, the component will have a corresponding maximum allowable stress The most commonly accepted mathematical representation of the relationship between applied stress and probability of survival for glasses is the Weibull Distribution[1  Th e Weibull cumulative density function \(CDF\s defined as  0 s Pe 004\005  0 1 ln ln ln ln s P 002 003 003     1 where is the applied stress P s is the corresponding probability of survival, and 0 and 002 are the characteristic parameters that define the distribution. For fracture analysis 0 is called the characteristic strength, and 002 is the Weibull modulus. The Weibull Modulus is a measure of the amount of scatter in the distribution; small values imply wide variations in strength, while large values imply more consistent strength values. The characteristic strength is a point estimate of the strength that corresponds to 36.79 probability of survival.  Often the distribution is expressed in the following form, which resembles a linear equation  002 3. The linear plot emphasizes the fact that the Weibull modulus 002 e slope of the linear curve, a nd the characteristic strength 0  is the applied load that corresponds to WF 0 \(P s  0.3679 Appropriate values for the characteristic strength and Weibull modulus are all that is required to relate survival probability to applied stress using the Weibull distribution  0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 051 0 Appli ed Stress, MPa Probability of Survival  a 6 4 2 0 2 00.511.522.5 ln\(Applied Stress\, MPa Weibull Factor  b  Figure 1. \(a b Factor plot Both describe the Weibull CDF for characteristic parameters 0 6.5 MPa and 002 3

Therefore, when we seek to characterize a glass, we are really characterizing a glass under a unique set of conditions.  This suggests that lab testing would only be useful if the laboratory test setup was identical to the application for which we sought the Weibull CDF characteristic parameters.  Fortunately, this is not the case There exist mathematical transformations that permit evaluation of the Weibull CDF, accounting for changes in load ty l o ad durat i on[3 and speci m e n si ze[1,3  Unfortunately, mathematical transformations that account for differences in material composition/processing or environment are not sufficiently developed for incorporation into this fo recasting method. Therefore values of 0 and 002 for a given glass can only be used, along with any necessary tr ansformations, to analyze applications with identical material com position/processing and identical or more benign ambient environmental conditions equivalent or lower relative humidity temperat  Values for 0 and 002 are determined experimentally.  Great care must be taken during testing to gather all necessary information for the forecasting process, including appropriate confidence bounds.  There are several ASTM standards regarding such characterizati A summary of the testing method and analysis details will be discussed in a forthcoming paper 4  S URVIVAL F ORECASTING  To determine the Weibull CDF that forecasts probability of survival for an application optic, laboratory values for 0  and 002 must be obtained for the specific glass composition/processing being used in the application.  Also the ambient environment for the application must be equivalent or more benign that that of the laboratory where the 0 and 002 values were obtained by test.

The 223effective time\224 t eff is designed to track the accumulated slow crack growth damage over the lifetime of the optic.  It is defined by as  0  v t n eff thtdt  013  7 where  max    0 ht t ht 003 003 017 020 021  022  where t is the applied stress as a function of time Positive values denote tension, and negative values denote compression.  The h\(t\nction nullifies the effect of negative values, because compressive forces do not contribute to slow crack growth 4]. The ratio of effective times in the application CDF relates the damage caused by slow crack growth over the lifetimes of the lab and application optics, based on stress magnitude and duration Table 1 lists the definitions of effective time for some common load types. If multiple load types will be applied to the application specimen, the effective times for each load type can be summed if the relative magnitude of the different load types is accounted for.

Its basis in fracture mechanics makes it more reliable than the blanket strength value currently being employed.  It also tends to be less restrictive, allowing for great er instrument performance in highly demanding applications The primary drawback of the method is that it requires detailed data for an identical glass \(composition and surface treatments\e used in the application.  Such data rarely preexists.  A useful follow-on to this work would be the characterization of widely used glasses, and the creation of a material library accessi ble to engineers.

I r Z  Figure 9 A Military Modeling and Simulation Configuration of the Ilium Framework To do that we have assembled a collection of trusted military simulations that span the range of such applications from fine-grained simulations that focus on detailed interactions between two entities to coarse-grained simulations of military campaigns Figure 9 illustrates the Ilium Framework configured to accommodate those simulations as well as representative prototype systems In this case the legacy applications are simulations analysis systems and design tools Prototypes are notional UAV autopilots route planners decision support systems and similar applications The Framework augments these applications with control objects and agents that coordinate computations in the composed system and specialize agents that typically represent the characteristics of a new system or technology that cannot be easily or adequately simulated in any of the component legacy systems In our current study the following systems have Ilium Framework plugins and are used as components in the study environment 12 Al f<cOmmi.ain FIa 1A  


THUNDER is a campaign simulation that models national military forces and military operations that extend over months 30  Characteristics of individual systems are evaluated statistically and their effects on the overall campaign are not explicitly known Political social and cultural objects and concepts are not included in the model In this configuration THUNDER is used to generate force level tasking mission orders and to evaluate and adjust for the results of missions with respect to campaign plans SEAS is a force level simulation that simulates battles between major forces in combat operations that typically last for hours and as much as a day SEAS features a flexible rules based decision logic that can influence behavior at both the commander and individual combatant level SEAS executes the missions requested by THUNDER and provides a manageable dynamic context for examining the behavior of prototypes in a range of typical operational situations  31 A dynamic plug-in supports interaction with the Framework and other pugged-in components EADSIM is a trusted model of air defense systems that is in particular sensitive to many important design attributes of individual systems In certain modified forms it can reference advanced sensor and engagement decision models In our study configuration EADSIM simulates enemy air defenses in selected e.g significant to our investigation portions of the virtual battle A dynamic plug-in supports system control as well as interaction with the Framework and other pugged-in components A prototype aircraft mission planning system plug-in supports virtual real time mission plan creation and updates In particular the system provides automatic route planning for selected platforms that have been assigned missions by THUNDER and that are subsequently executed in simulation in SEAS and EADSIM The Ilium Framework itself provides software agents that are used to model notional or experimental UAV characteristics and behaviors Depending on the objectives of a particular study the Framework may also provide agents that address advanced Command and Control concepts to coordinate the interaction of the various component systems We maintain a semantic consistency among the plugged-in component applications by developing a single operational scenario as initial input for a study and deriving the necessary application configuration data from that source We create an RDF model of the scenario based on the Ilium suite of ontologies that includes political context issues objectives sensitivities etc military context centers of gravity campaign objectives etc geophysical environment military units order of battle unit equipment lists etc command and control assets platforms weapons ISR systems etc Figure 11 below is an excerpt from an operational scenario set in the Southwest U.S depicting a description of an Air Force Wing assigned to a notional Joint Task Force The Wing is based at Bishop Air Base and has six Fighter Squadrons assigned to it Additional detail about each of those squadrons as well as the base is found in the model in this case an rdf:resource  associated with it morg:AirForceWing rdf:ID="USAF_366 Air_Exp Wg dc:creator>Doug Holmes</dc:creator mgeo:basedAt rdf:resource="#BishopAB geo:positionedAt rdf:resource="#BishopAB_pos morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF 390_Ftr_Sq morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF_494_Ftr_Sq dc date I 0/20/07</dc date morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF_496 Ftr_Sq rdfs:comment>366 AEW F-22 F-15 KC-135 130]</rdfs:comment morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF 389_Ftr_Sq morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF 391 Ftr_Sq morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF 495_Ftr_Sq rdfs:label>366 Air Expeditionary Wing</rdfs:label morg:AirForceWing ab9 7P.b ii uI1 L L CFigure 11 An RDF model of a notional USAF Wing Figure 12 is another excerpt from the same scenario illustrating a model of a particular Fighter Squadron and one of the F-15E aircraft it operates Figure 10 Legacy Components in the Ilium Framework 13 suka

aircraft Note that these models also have associated SEAS models that contain information peculiar to the SEAS simulation about these entities This information is used to configure SEAS to properly represent these particular entities We are also able to insert objects and information that may be of interest in our study that is not represented in any of the component simulations or other applications Where those objects are related to an object that is simulated that relationship permits inferences about the effects on them as a result of actions that are computed in a simulation For example it is possible to indicate that GeorgeAB defends the capital city and lend special significance to the actions of aircraft that are based there even though none of the simulations in the composite system have any notion of capital city Finally the operational scenario provides an explicit record of the assumptions that underly the study and can also include and explicit representation of system and study goals This practice improves analysis and may enable future knowledge based analytical tools Throughout the process of constructing the operational scenario and when it is complete we use one or more Description Logic Reasoners to ensure the logical consistency of the the model A number of these automatic theorem provers are freely available including Pellet 32 33 FaCT  34 and OWLIM 35 are used in the Framework to compute logical entailments and to complete RDF models as well as to ensure the consistency of models In the later capacity frequent checks will identify errors in the construction some e.g Pellet also indicate the source of the error and aid in repairing it As a result we are confident that the operational scenario is a sound model The primary use of the Reasoners allows us to significantly extend the explicit RDF model that is created For example a squadron is explicitly specified as assignedTo a wing and that relationship is the inverse of assignedOrg then the system can infer that the wing has the squadron as an assigned organization even though that fact has never been asserted Similarly if the same relationship is defined as a transitive relationship it is possible to infer that a flight that is assigned to the squadron is also assigned to the wing Once we have an operational scenario that has been classified by a Reasoner we then use the completed model to configure the composite system Ilium and the pluggedin systems to execute the simulation We use SPARQL a W3C standard query language designed to access RDFL to extract data from the scenario to create the input files needed to configure the various applications.[36 SELECT name pos long lat alt vis W1HLERE name rdf:type mast SeasLocation name geo:positionedAt pos pos pos:long long pos pos:lat lat pos pos:alt alt name msim:Visible vis  Figure 13 A typical SPARQL query In a similar fashion SPARQL is used to extract data from the scenario to create the necessary Ilium java surrogate control and agents SPARQL can also be used to review the scenario and answer questions that have arisen since the inception of the study At this point we are able execute the scenario with confidence that it will produce reliable results 7 CONCLUSIONS We have developed a methodology and supporting tools for creating an operational scenario that supports the semantic interoperability of an ad hoc collection of legacy applications and extends their capabilities The method depends on and ensures the logical integrity of the composite system Therefore when we assemble as a collection of legacy component systems that were not originally intended to interoperate with other systems we can be confidant that the composite system will produce consistent results Logical consistency implies that to the degree that we trust the interpretation underlying the model the results of operations on the model are trustworthy If for example the model is based on a Newtonian interpretation of physics the model ought to provide reliable answers to questions about automotive and even aeronautical engineering but probably not to all questions in astronomy or cosmology This methodology extends the utility of trusted simulations allowing integration of finegrained simulations that are sensitive to design requirements with high level coarse-grained simulations that are sensitive to acquisition issues and policy The potential benefits of 14 


this sort of interoperation may range from obvious production efficiencies to clearer insights into system requirements Finally an important side-effect of the approach is the OWL/RDF knowledge base formed by the combination of the operational scenario and the results of the operations of the legacy systems That knowledge base and the use of SPARQL queries and SWRL rules effectively expands the functionality of the system and greatly improves the analysis of the output of the system of cooperating simulations and tools We have prepared a foundation for the application of Semantic Web and other knowledge based tools in the analysis and design of unmanned systems We anticipate the development and application of these tools and the addition of autonomy directed Multiple Agent Systems MAS that use RDF/XML inter-agent communications in the coming year REFERENCES 1 NAFCAM 2001 Exploiting EManufacturing:Ineroperability of Software Systems Used by U.S Manufacturers available at 12 Protege Ontology Editor documentation available at http proteae.stanf6rd.edu 13 Top Braid Composer Datasheet available at 14 W and Nicola Guarino 2001 Support for Ontological Analysis of Taxonomic Relationships J Data and Knowled 39\(1 October 2001 15 Natalya F Noy and Deborah L McGuinness Ontology Development 10 1 A Guide to Creating Your First Ontology  Stanford University Stanford CA 94305 16 Alan Rector Modularisation of Domain Ontologies Implemented in Description Logics and related formalisms including OWL K-CAP'03 October 23-25 2003 Sanibel Island Florida USA pp 121-8 2003 17 Cyc Homepage available at htc.c 18 Open Cyc home page available at 19 SUMO Description and Home Page available at 19 SENSUS Description and Home Page available at 2 Bemers-Lee Tim Hendler Jim Lasilla Ora The Semantic Web Scientific American available at 20 DOLCE A Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering ontology and documents available at 3 Bemers-Lee Tim Blog on Design Issues available at 4 RDF Primer available at s chema/#ref-rdf-primer 5 Lacey Lee OWL Representing Information Using the Web Ontology Language Trafford Publishing 2005 6 OWL Web Ontology Language Guide available at Jten pHomewPage availal adt 7 Jena Home Page available at 8 Protege Home Page available at h1ttp  protegest nftanford.edu,X 1 9 Baader Calvanese McGuiness Nardi and PatelSchnieder Description Logic Handbook 10 Oberle Daniel Semantic Management of Middleware Springer 2006 OWL Web Ontology Language Guide available at 21 Nicola Gauarino Claudio Masolo Stefano Borgo Aldo Gangemi and Alessandro Oltramari Ontology Infrastructure for the Semantic Web Wonder World Deliverable DI 8 Laboratory for Applied Ontology Trento Italy 2001 available on line at ht X1t1 22 DUL.owl ontology available at www.1oa23t og DLl 23 Amy Knutilla Steven Polyak Craig Schlenoff Austin Tate Shu Chiun Cheah Steven Ray and Richard Anderson Process Specification Language An Analysis of Existing Representations NIST report available at http llwww.mel.nlist.gov/msid.librarZ/d.oc/psl-1 _.df 24 Process Specification Language Ontology available at http-//www,55,me l.nit gov/psl 25 Ontology for Geography Markup Language GML3.0 owl ontology available at ok i.cae.drexel.edu./-wbs/onltology/2004/09/ogc-gmI1 26 Ontology for Geography Markup Language GML3.0 of Open GIS Consortium OGC Home Page available at 15

Prior to coming to the Georgia Institute of Technology \(GTRI\ in 2003, Chris was a BMEWS Radar hardware manager for the US Air Force and at MITRE and Xontech he was responsible for radar performance analysis of PAVE PAWS, BMEWS and PARCS UHF radar systems Chris is an accomplished radar-systems analyst familiar with all hardware and software aspects of missile-tracking radar systems with special expertise related to radar cueing/acquisition/tracking for ballistic missile defense ionospheric effects on UHF radar calibration and track accuracy, radar-to-radar handover, and the effects of enhanced PRF on radar tracking accuracy.  At GTRI, Chris is responsible for detailed analysis of ground-test and flight-test data and can be credited with improving radar calibration, energy management, track management, and atmospheric-effects compensation of Ballistic Missile Defense System radars   Paul D. Burns received his Bachelor of Science and Masters of Science in Electrical Engineering at Auburn University in 1992 and 1995 respectively. His Master\222s thesis research explored the utilization of cyclostationary statistics for performing phased array blind adaptive beamforming From 1995 to 2000 he was employed at Dynetics, Inc where he performed research and analysis in a wide variety of military radar applications, from air-to-air and air-toground pulse Doppler radar to large-scale, high power aperture ground based phased array radar, including in electronic attack and protection measures. Subsequently, he spent 3 years at MagnaCom, Inc, where he engaged in ballistic missile defense system simulation development and system-level studies for the Ground-based Midcourse defense \(GMD\ system. He joined GTRI in 2003, where he has performed target tracking algorithm research for BMD radar and supplied expertise in radar signal and data processing for the Missile Defense Agency and the Navy Integrated Warfare Systems 2.0 office.  Mr. Burns has written a number of papers in spatio-temporal signal processing, sensor registration and target tracking, and is currently pursuing a Ph.D. at the Georgia Institute of Technology  


  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs.
