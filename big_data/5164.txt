Data management systems Complex Event Processing CEP is recognized as a high performance online query scheme which in particular deals with the velocity aspect of the 3-V's of Big Data However traditional CEP systems do not consider data variety and lack the capability to embed ad hoc queries over the volume of data streams In this paper we propose H 2 O  a stateful complex event processing framework to support hybrid online and on-demand queries over realtime data We propose a semantically enriched event and query model to 
address data variety  A formal query algebra is developed to precisely capture the stateful and containment semantics of online and on-demand queries We describe techniques to achieve the interactive query processing over realtime data featured by ef\002cient online querying dynamic stream data persistence and on-demand access The system architecture is presented and the current implementation status reported Keywords complex event processing stream processing inmemory database big data semantic web I I NTRODUCTION Existing Big Data solutions primarily focus on addressing the 
volume aspect of the 3-V's of Big Data As a result specialized technologies including distributed databases  Hadoop 19 and NoSQL 12 ha v e been de v eloped to support scalable data storage and on-demand querying over large volumes of data These systems usually provide high read performance for data that has been persisted and properly indexed Recently the velocity and variety sides of Big Data are attracting increasing attention Or g anizations such as social media utility companies and 002nancial institutions often face scenarios where they need to analyze heterogeneous 223in-\003ight\224 data for businesses analytics For exam 
ple applications including realtime bidding RTB digital shopping dynamic demand response in Smart Grid and algorithmic trading need to process realtime data such as advertisements shopping activities sensor readings and stock ticks respectively originating from various sources to make timely decisions Data for these applications arrive at high-rate streams and may vary in terms of structure and meanings One challenge of these emerging realtime Big Data applications is the need to concurrently support both online and on-demand queries over data streams Online queries represent persistent user interests that need to be evaluated continuously as new data appears in order to trigger realtime actions On the other hand on-demand queries model 
transient user interests which need to be answered in an ad hoc manner usually using stored history data Traditional Big Data solutions often adopt a 223multi-temperature\224 architecture where data that is frequently accessed hot data is on fast storage compared to less-frequently accessed data warm and cold data placed on slower storage Realtime data appears at the top of hot storage requiring on-the-\003y write and read processing The unique characteristics of realtime data offers the opportunity for on-the-\003y querying with dynamic data lifecycle management that obviates the need to persistently store everything One key notion of realtime data is its transient property 1 new data arrives on streams at high 
velocity and 2 old data leaves streams or the values of data fade away at potentially high velocity For example consider a digital shopping scenario where a large number of web orders are placed and processed concurrently Activities such as order creation payment and delivery need to be monitored continuously to detect service level agreement SLA violations and offer on-demand status check However after an order is completely ful\002lled it is no longer 223alive\224 or of value for SLA detection and status check queries Complex Event Processing CEP is a popular technique for querying realtime data CEP deals with detecting realtime situations represented as event patterns from among many 
event streams CEP is commonly used for operational intelligence where online query pattern detection drives realtime responses and is used in domains overlapping with Big Data applications ranging from e-commerce to energy industry to 002nancial services However traditional CEP systems do not consider data variety and only support online queries Most existing CEP 2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data 978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 199 


systems such as 3 adopt a SQL-lik e query language and evaluate event data at the syntactic level These CEP queries are pre-de\002ned listen to new events and trigger outputs when the patterns are matched completely Temporary states observed by the system are not managed for external access and hence not available for on-demand querying In this paper we propose H 2 O  a stateful Complex Event Processing framework to support hybrid online and on-demand querying over realtime data Speci\002cally our contributions include Y We introduce a uni\002ed event and query model 247 III for online and on-demand query speci\002cation over heterogeneous realtime data streams Y We develop a formal query algebra to capture the stateful and containment semantics of queries which forms the basis for dynamic life-cycle management and on-demand access of realtime data 247 IV Y We discuss processing techniques of this hybrid model for ef\002cient online and on-demand query evaluation over data streams 247 V II M OTIVATING A PPLICATIONS Our work is motivated by applications from domains as diverse as e-commerce and Smart Grid to provide users with both happened-after online and happened-before ondemand forms of situation awareness Online queries detect immediate occurrences of pre-de\002ned situations to drive timely actions On-demand queries on the other hand extract post-de\002ned situations from observed data for analysis In the following we describe a few compelling scenarios from the e-commerce and the energy industry which demonstrate the need for both hybrid online and on-demand query capabilities over realtime data across diverse domains Digital shopping plays a vital role in today's retail industry and allows consumers to directly buy physical or virtual goods and services from vendors over the Internet Consider a simpli\002ed digital shopping process which consists of a sequential set of activities creating web order checking inventory processing payment processing delivery and email noti\002cation An order has to be ful\002lled within a limited time window which may range from a few minutes to days Online queries can be used to monitor the order completeness or report SLA violations in realtime During the intermediate processing steps a customer may issue ondemand queries to check the order status and vendors may need to determine how many orders are accumulated in say the order creation step in case the inventory is low and action needs to be taken to avoid an SLA violation Dynamic demand response DR is a promising technique in Smart Grid for identifying demand-side energy curtailment opportunities through the analysis of high volume sensor readings that are delivered over the network In a campus Micro Grid for example online queries may correlate meter readings occupancy sensor readings and room schedules to detect 002ne-grained power curtailment opportunities both in temporal and spatial dimensions However infrequent events such as a change in room schedules or sporting events may also impact DR decisions This requires correlation of partially matched online queries with unexpected events on-demand for operational intelligence Other applications that motivate hybrid querying of data streams include realtime bidding RTB 226 the next breakthrough of mobile advertising algorithmic 002nancial trading and so on In general we notice that from a user's perspective  a query of interest in these applications can be either persistent which requires continuous evaluation over new data or it can be transient which require one-time evaluation over 223live\224 data observed on streams On the other hand from the data's perspective  all the applications deal with data that arrives and leaves on streams dynamically over time Users are only interested in data items within a certain period of time or in other word within the data's life-cycle This life-cycle can be a simple time window or a complex set of correlation constraints III E VENT AND Q UERY M ODEL We propose a Complex Event Processing based approach for hybrid querying of realtime data CEP systems are originally designed to process online queries over highrate event streams Since CEP queries persist intermediate matching states for incremental evaluation we propose to leverage CEP query states for data life-cycle management and expose the dynamically persisted streams for on-demand querying In addition we also attempt to address data variety by providing semantically enriched queries In this section we present the event and uni\002ed query model extended from traditional CEP models for both online and on-demand query speci\002cation over heterogeneous data streams In particular we illustrate how this model can be used to support the Big Data application scenarios discussed in the previous section A Event Model 1 Event Syntax Realtime data can be modeled as timestamped relational tuples or name-value pairs as below Event 002 000 f name   timestamp g To facilitate later discussions we introduce an event operator T 210 e 215 to get the timestamp property of an event e represented using the above model We introduce an event set operator  to get the set of temporally ordered events which exist in an event set or a set of event sets In addition event stream is formally de\002ned as De\002nition 1 A temporally ordered event set S is said to be an event stream  A stream S of events with attribute names a 1  a 2  is denoted as S 210 a 1  a 2   215  A few useful relations between event streams are identi\002ed as follows 200 


Figure 1 Stream Containment De\002nition 2 A stream S 234 is said to be contained by stream S  if 246 e  S 234 we have e  S in the same temporal order S is said to be the super stream of S 234 and S 234 is the sub stream of S  denoted as S c S 234 or S 234 b S  De\002nition 3 A temporarily ordered subset of stream S from start time t s to end time t e  denoted as S t e t s  is said to be a child stream of S  denoted as S t e t s  S  and S is the parent stream of S t e t s  denoted as S A S t e t s  Particularly S 024\252 t is said to be the upper stream of S and S t 020\252 is said to be the down stream of S  at time t  As shown in Figure 1 a child stream S t e t s of S is a special sub stream of S and S 000 S 024\252 020\252  In later discussions symbol 020\252 and 024\252 will be omitted 2 Event Semantics Realtime data may vary in both structural formats and semantic meanings The tuple-based representation normalizes data formats The semantic variety is re\003ected in the tuple representation by allowing names and values which are either literals or domain concepts to have related variants Take realtime bidding as example and assume a simpli\002ed RTB event captures category  zip  price attributes of an advertised item Among these attributes the value of price is a number which intrinsically has arithmetic relations to other numbers However the attribute name price itself can be equivalent to cost in the domain On the other hand the category attribute may have values SUV or VAN  which are conceptually subclasses of vehicle or car  Capturing the backend knowledge of target domains is a prerequisite to query over data with semantic varieties The semantics of numeric literals are built into computing systems For events which compose domain-speci\002c attributes we have to provide an explicit knowledge model to capture data semantics We have applied Semantic Web ontologies to model relevant concepts and their relationships in domains such as Smart Grid These domain ontologies are seamlessly integrated with the proposed event model and query model as discussed later to address data varieties B Query Model We provide a uni\002ed model for both online queries which represent persistent user interests and on-demand queries which represent transient user interests over realtime events Existing CEP query languages 4 18 e xtend relational query models with explicit temporal operators to facilitate query speci\002cation over event streams We adopt the following query syntax with the key CEP query operators H2O Query 002 000 SELECT\(output definition FILTER\(non-correlated constraints  JOIN\(attribute correlations  SEQ\(temporal order correlations  WINDOW\(temporal range correlations  where the SELECT operator projects event attributes to query result the FILTER operator speci\002es constraints over attributes of individual events while JOIN  SEQ and WINDOW de\002ne attribute comparison time ordering and bounding constraints across multiple events We formally de\002ne query constraints as De\002nition 4 A constraint or clause C speci\002ed in query Q is an event evaluation expression de\002ned using a query operator denoted as C  Q  Here we assume each query is composed of a set of constraints with logic AND relations otherwise the query is decomposed to multiple independent queries We also note R 000 Q 8 P if query R contains and only contains constraints de\002ned in query Q and P  We illustrate the various query constructs of the above model using online query examples from the motivating applications Denote digital shopping stream as DS\(from orderId task category  realtime bidding stream as RTB\(from adId action category zip price  and meter reading stream as MTR\(from buildingId reading  Query 1 Simple Filtering Notify whenever there is an automobile sale in the neighborhood area of zip code 90007 and with price less than 5,000 SELECT a FILTER\(?a.from=RTB FILTER\(?a.category rdf:type auto:car FILTER\(?a.zip geo:hasNeighbor geo:Z90007 FILTER\(?a.price<5000 As shown in Query 1 FILTER constraints are represented as triple patterns which evaluate realtime events against literals such as 5000 or domain concepts such as auto:car and geo:Z90007 using arithmatic or semantic predicates The semantic predicates and concepts with namespaces are captured in domain ontology models described previously The above query combined with the domain ontologies shield semantic varieties of underlying data from users The ontology with name space 223auto:\224 captures various concepts and their relations in the automobile domain Events using any equivalent or subclass concept of auto:car can potentially match the high-level query Query 2 Aggregation Report when the last 10 minutes average power demand of building EEB exceeds 600KW SELECT AVG\(?m.reading FILTER\(?m.from=MTR FILTER\(?m.building EEB WINDOW\(?m,sliding,10min 


Query 2 shows the speci\002cation of an aggregation pattern and moving time window A sliding time window is essentially a constraint which correlates event data with intrinsic world time events Here a meter reading event will fall out of the window and no longer be of concern when it was 10 minutes older than the current time Query 3 Join Report when an advertised item was purchased within one day SELECT p FILTER\(?p.from,?s.from=RTB FILTER\(?p.action=publish FILTER\(?s.action purchase JOIN\(?p.adId=?s.adId WINDOW w,sliding,1day WINDOW\(?e,sliding,10min Query 3 shows the speci\002cation of JOIN constraint which always appear with WINDOW s to correlate multiple events Query 4 Sequence Report orders which are successfully ful\002lled within 2 hours following a sequence of tasks including order  deliver and email notice  SELECT w FILTER\(?w.from,?d.from,?e.from=DS FILTER\(?w.task=order FILTER\(?d.task=deliver FILTER e.task=notice SEQ\(?w->?d\(orderId w.orderId orderId=?w.orderId Query 4 shows the speci\002cation of a sequence data pattern on DS stream The SEQ operator de\002nes an ordered set of events 223  224 is a transitive predicate indicating the left-side event has a older timestamp than the right-side event On-demand queries have the same syntax as the online queries shown above However on-demand queries summarize observed data rather than continuously evaluating new data arriving on streams Due to the transient property of realtime data described in 247 I it is not necessary to persist the entire data set observed on streams for on-demand querying On the other hand we propose a query-over-query scheme which allows perform on-demand queries over data of interest which is dynamically managed by online queries To achieve this next we introduce a formal query algebra to establish the relations between CEP queries IV Q UERY A LGEBRA To support an interactive query processing model we study CEP query relations based on their intermediate and 002nal matching results We start with individual query operators and constraints then extend discussions to full queries A Operator and Constraint Semantics Between individual query constraints we have De\002nition 5 A query constraint C 234 is said to be contained by another constraint C if 246 E  where E is an event set that satis\002es C 234  E also satis\002es C  C is said to be the super constraint of C 234  denoted as C c C 234  and C 234 be the sub constraint of C  denoted as C 234 b C  Obviously super constraints are more relaxed than their sub constraints For example FILTER\(?a.price  5000 is a super constraint of FILTER\(?w.price  1000  FILTER\(?a.category rdf:type auto:car is a super constraint of FILTER\(?a.type rdf:type auto:SUV  WINDOW m,sliding,10min is a super constraint of WINDOW\(?m,sliding,5min  and SEQ w  d is a super constraint of SEQ w  d  e  Online CEP queries are evaluated incrementally and events belonging to a result set do not necessarily arrive at the same time This property is associated with query operators and we have the following notion De\002nition 6 A CEP operator is stateful if evaluating constraints de\002ned using it for a new event refers to any observed events Otherwise it is said to be stateless  Obviously among operators described in 247 III FILTER is stateless while JOIN  SEQ and WINDOW are stateful B Query Semantics We extend the concept of statefulness and containment to full queries Statefulness of an online CEP query indicates the necessity of the query to temporarily persist events during the matching process while the containment property provides insights into the relations between partial and 002nal matchings of different queries De\002nition 7 A query is stateful if online evaluation of the query for a new event refers to previously observed events Otherwise the query is said to be stateless  Obviously an online query is stateful if it contains any stateful operators otherwise it is stateless Next we formally de\002ne query result sets before studying query containment De\002nition 8 An event set M is said to be a match of query Q on stream S  denoted as M  Q 210 S 215  if M ful\002lls all query constraints in Q  and if any event in M was removed M no longer ful\002lls Q  An event set M is said to be a priormatch of query Q on stream S at t  denoted as M  002\320 Q t 210 S 215  if M  Q 210 S 215  and 246 e  M we have T 210 e 215 B t  Similarly an event set M is said to be a post-match of query Q on stream S at t  denoted as M  320\000 Q t 210 S 215  if M  Q 210 S 215  and 246 e  M we have T 210 e 215 A t  An event set M is said to be a crossmatch or eventual-match of query Q on stream S at t  denoted as M  002\000 Q t 210 S 215  if M  Q 210 S 215  and 247 e  M having T 210 e 215 A t  and 247 e 234  M having T 210 e 234 215  t  Obviously we have Q 210 S 215 000 002\320 Q t 210 S 215 8 320\000 Q t 210 S 215 8 002\000 Q t 210 S 215 1 To detect eventual-matches  at time t an online query Q has to manage a temporary storage of events which consists of all e which satis\002es e   210 002\000 Q t 210 S 215\215 and T 210 e 215 B t  Since 002\000 Q t 210 S 215 is unknown at t  the storage condition has to be relaxed and Q persists event sets which potentially match Q after t  The potential matches are the partial matches or states of the query at t  The formal de\002nition is below 202 


De\002nition 9 An event set N is said to be a partial match of query Q on stream S at time t  denoted as N  026 Q t 210 S 215  if N 266 Q 210 S 215  N x g  N does not violate any constraints of Q  removing an event from N violates satis\002ed constraints and adding any event e to N where e  S t does not ful\002ll new constraints in Q  The set of all partial matches 026 Q t 210 S 215 is said to be the state of Q at t  To justify that the query states de\002ned above contain all maximum subsets of eventual-matches of Q at t  we have the following theorem and its proof by contradiction Theorem 1 For all M  002\000 Q t 210 S 215 we have M 020 S t  026 Q t 210 S 215  Proof Suppose not Assume on the contrary 247 M  002\000 Q t 210 S 215 we have M 020 S t 266 026 Q t 210 S 215  Obviously we have M  Q 210 S 215  Denote M t 000 M 9 S t and M t  M 020 S t  we have M  M t 8 M t  From the supposition we have M t 266 026 Q t 210 S 215  i.e M t is not a partial match of Q at t  Based on the de\002nition of cross-match  we already have M t x g  M t 266 Q 210 S 215  and M t does not violate any constraints of Q  Based on the de\002nition of partial match  either removing an event e from M t does not violate satis\002ed constraints or adding an event e where e  S t to M t will ful\002ll additional query constraints If it is the former case we have 210 M t 020 e 215 8 M t  M 020 e is a match of Q which contradicts with M  Q 210 S 215  If it is the later case we have 210 M t 024 e 215 8 M t  M 024 e is a match of Q which also contradicts with M  Q 210 S 215  Hence the supposition M 020 S t 266 026 Q t 210 S 215 is false and the theorem is true From Theorem 1 we in addition have Theorem 2 Let 026 Q t 210 S 215 be the state of query Q at t  we have  210 Q 210 S 215 020 002\320 Q 210 S 215\215 b  210 026 Q t 210 S 215\215 8 S t  Theorem 2 indicates all unknown matches of Q at t can be derived from the query state at t and events arriving on stream after t  In other words it is suf\002cient for an online query Q to only persist states given by De\002nition 9 to detect matches after t  The proof of Theorem 2 is straightforward Existing CEP systems implement online pattern matching based on the fact formally described in Theorem 2 while query states have been isolate and hidden As we described in 247 II additional insights to realtime data can be extracted or queried over intermediate query states on-demand To formalize such query-over-query scheme we study the relations between CEP queries De\002nition 10 A query Q 234 is said to be contained by another query Q  if 246 stream S 234  247 S c S 234 having 246 M 234  Q 234 210 S 234 215  247 M  Q 210 S 215 and M 234 b M  Q is said to be the super query of Q 234  denoted as Q c Q 234  and Q 234 be the sub query of Q  denoted as Q 234 b Q  The de\002nition indicates for any match event set of a sub query Q 234  we can 002nd a complimentary event set which makes the union of the two sets a match of its super query Q  Obviously the containment relation is transitive and symmetric In addition it has the following property Theorem 3 Let Q 234 b Q  246 query D we have D 210  210 026 Q 234 t 210 S 215\215\215 b D 210  210 026 Q t 210 S 215\215\215  Figure 2 Pipelined Query Plan Proof We only need to prove  210 026 Q 234 t 210 S 215\215 b  210 026 Q t 210 S 215\215  Suppose not Assume on the contrary 247 e   210 026 Q 234 t 210 S 215\215 and e 266  210 026 Q t 210 S 215\215  Denote M 234  026 Q 234 t 210 S 215 as one partial match of Q 234 at t with e  M 234  Based on De\002nition 10 we have an event set N which makes M 234 8 N  Q 210 S 215  From Theorem 1 M 234 8 N 020 S t  026 Q t 210 S 215  Since e 266 S t we have e  M 234 8 N 020 S t and e   210 026 Q t 210 S 215\215 which contradicts with the supposition Hence the supposition is false and the theorem is true Theorem 3 indicates given any on-demand query D at time t  one can retrieve the patterns which satisfy D and potentially match Q 234 from the result event sets of applying D over the state of a super query of Q 234 at t  This allows use a single query persisting dynamic matching states for its sub queries for on-demand querying To determine containment relations we obviously have Theorem 4 Query Q is a super query of Q 234 if and only if any constraint of Q 234 has a super constraint in Q  V P ROCESSING M ODEL Having described the uni\002ed query model and algebra in this section we present approaches to process online and on-demand queries respectively A Online Query Processing In the H2O model online queries evaluate new data continuously arriving on streams and persist states dynamically 1 Query Evaluation Online query evaluation implements a data-driven paradigm with pipelined operators as shown in Figure 2 We classify online queries as queries with WINDOW operators and queries with SEQ operators WINDOW queries may also have optional JOIN operators For a given query stateless FILTERs are 002rstly evaluated following an evaluation path As depicted in Figure 3 002lters associated with all queries form a 002ltering graph where the root nodes are 002lters evaluating stream associations such as FILTER\(?a.from=RTB in Query 1 and leaf nodes are 002ltering outputs associated with particular event variables The inner 002lters evaluate event attributes against literals or semantic concepts which may be shared across queries Depending on window types a stateful WINDOW constraint is compiled to an event queue persisting observed events and evaluated on every new arriving event including 


system time events to dynamically expire events that fall out of the window JOIN constraints correlate events persisted in windows SEQ constraints similar to most existing CEP systems can be processed with a Non-deterministic Finite Automata NFA based algorithm for incremental evaluation 2 Data Life-cycle Management One main objective of H2O is to achieve dynamic data life-cycle management to avoid storing the entire stream data for on-demand querying The life-cycle of realtime data is managed based on online query state persistence Since we adopt an inmemory storage model although we use the word 223state persistence\224 individual online queries do not physically store 223live\224 events but only references to them Physically events for each stream are stored in separated event lists The number of query states which reference a particular event is updated as the metadata of the events in realtime When an event is evicted from the last referencing query state due to a violation of query constraints or match of a query the event is removed from the in-memory storage As such the system keeps at most one copy of an event and each online query can be considered as a view over the actual data store B On-demand Query Processing On-demand queries are applied over online query views We adopt an event replay approach for on-demand query evaluation since on-demand queries adopt the same temporal query models Here on-demand queries are compiled similar to online queries to pipelined query plans with the difference that they do not monitor input data streams When an on-demand query is issued over a base online query an event stream which consists of events persisted in the current online query states will be reconstructed and fed to the on-demand query plan to generate results An alternative approach worth mentioning is query rewriting In this approach query constraints de\002ned using temporal operators including WINDOW and SEQ are rewritten into equivalent FILTER constraints so that the new query can be performed over persisted data directly C System Architecture The proposed architecture of H2O is shown in Figure 3 It consists of three main components 226 the domain ontology models  the query publisher module and the core query processing engine  The domain ontology model  represented in Semantic Web OWL ontology language forms a knowledge-base of domain concepts and their relations to support semantic-level query speci\002cation and evaluation Particularly for the Smart Grid DR application we organize ontologies in a modular fashion for extensibility The query publisher module creates and publishes query plans for both online and on-demand queries For an online query the module compiles and deploys the query to the Figure 3 System Architecture processing engine for continuously evaluation For an ondemand query this module compiles the query as query plan and replay corresponding state event sets for results The query processing engine implements the core algorithms and data structures for online query evaluation query state persistence and on-demand query answering On-line and on-demand queries are processed independently The query engine consists of operator processors executing constraints in pipeline These include the stateless 002lter graph processor stateful window sequence and join processors using techniques described in 247 V A global dynamic stream storage is used to hold 223alive\224 events for on-demand access The data life-cycle is dynamically controlled by online query states as described previously We build the hybrid online on-demand query engine by extending an existing CEP engine Siddhi W e are currently working on extending stateful processors for state persistence and access Most of the other system building blocks are available In our prior work we ha v e e xtended Siddhi to support ontology integration and semantic 002lter evaluation The on-demand query processing is mostly a reuse of our event replay implementation described in VI R ELATED W ORK Our work falls in the space of stream computing and Complex Event Processing These systems offer intuitive languages to query and react to realtime data with low latency Stream computing systems such as Aurora InfoSphere and Storm 13 support 002ltering and aggre g ation of data streams using a work\003ow based paradigm On the other hand CEP systems like SASE Cayug a 3 and Siddhi typically follo w a SQL-lik e query syntax offering native temporal operators in addition to the relational operators for temporal pattern speci\002cation and matching Both types of systems have been focusing on scalability and high availability for online query evaluation 17 H2O is however the 002rst Big Data streaming system which aims to deal with all the 3-V's aspects H2O incorporates 204 


semantic domain knowledge to address data variety  We not only consider online querying over data streams but also from a completely new perspective use CEP as a dynamic stream storage for on-demand querying Database systems which may seem appealing to implement the hybrid query model is also relevant Distributed databases and in-memory databases 7 support ef\002cient on-demand queries at high reading rates Realtime databases and active databases 21 de v eloped schedule or trigger mechanisms to perform online queries over dynamic data We extend CEP to support hybrid online and on-demand queries with a query-over-query paradigm This allows 003exible stream storage provisioning which is extremely important for applications supporting heterogeneous data and users In addition our approach inherits intuitive temporal query speci\002cation and ef\002cient online query processing capabilities from CEP systems Different to relational and NoSQL query models CEP provides explicit temporal operators such as time window and temporal order to correlate realtime data Designated algorithms such as NFA are used for high-throughput query matching over data streams Realtime and active databases can perform online relational queries but do not scale to such highrate inputs or queries Stream databases such as 22 offer powerful query languages with sliding windows and sequence operators but also do not scale to high data rate VII C ONCLUSIONS In this paper we introduce a stateful Complex Event Processing framework to meet the needs of emerging realtime Big Data applications across all 3-V's The proposed system supports semantic-level query speci\002cation over realtime data to deal with data variety  It inherits CEP systems high performance online querying capabilities to deal with data velocity  Furthermore we extend traditional CEP systems to support on-demand querying to deal with data volume on streams The formal query algebra we proposed captures the stateful and containment semantics of realtime data queries which form the basis for the hybrid query paradigm Various query processing techniques we introduce work toward ef\002cient execution of this hybrid model including online query evaluation query-based stream storage provisioning dynamic data life-cycle management and on-demand query evaluation There are several implementation issues to be considered further as we complete our prototype based on these formal abstractions One of them is the scalability of the in-memory state persistence model When the stateful CEP system processes a large number of long running online queries the system memory may be drained out To address this issue we are exploring scale-out opportunities by distributing the H2O query model over the network The

   9 extreme radiation environment could induce faults i n these components that can only be cleared by the removal and reapplication of power termed off-pulsing The FM S implements an off-pulsing architecture that provide s offpulsing capabilities to clear faults in the transce iver IEM and PDU. Mechanisms are provided to allow individua l offpulsing of any of these components in Operational M ode. In addition to address a safety net for unknown fault s the FMS can reset the entire system by off-pulsing all three of these critical components simultaneously in Safe Mo de In general, the off-pulsing of any single component is handled in Operational Mode as a response to a less severe fault while the off-pulsing of all three components is ha ndled in Safe Mode as a response to the expiration of the ha rdware command loss timer i.e the spacecraft has not re ceived a specific command from the ground in 3.6 days  All off-pulse requests are routed through the PDU with the PDU implementing a specific hardware command sequen ce for each off-pulse type The off-pulse mechanism is  designed to be fault-tolerant with a single fault r esulting in at most a single off-pulse cycle  The FM architec ture utilizes the following off-pulse requests: IEM requ est to offpulse transceiver via software command loss timer SWCLT    t r a n s c e i v e r  r e q u e s t  t o  o f f p u l s e  I E M   v i a  RF CCD command transceiver request of off-pulse PDU via RF CCD command and hardware command loss timer HWCLT request to off-pulse PDU IEM and transcei ver as shown in Figure  8   Figure 8:  Top Level Off-Pulsing Architecture  2.4.2.3  Limited Instrument Fault Management The final high-level requirement that drives the mo des and safing approach is limited instrument FM.  The FMS is decoupled from the science instruments Instrument FM  is limited to the monitoring of instrument power draw power down request and heartbeat The instrument generat es and provides the spacecraft with status information in the Interface Transfer Format ITF Instrument status includes power-down requests and an instrument aliveness cou nter An instrument power-down request or frozen alivenes s indicator results in the removal of operational pow er from the instrument within a pre-defined number of secon ds In the event of an instrument over-current/over-power condition the instrument is immediately powered of f with no advanced warning Over-current/over-power protec tion is handled with a combination of autonomy rules and  resettable circuit breakers located in the PDU To protect against hard shorts the PDU monitors current and i f the load current exceeds a threshold for 4 ms, the circ uit breaker opens the switch and power is immediately removed f rom the instrument Autonomy rules protect against soft  shorts by monitoring a lower power threshold for a longer duration  In addition spacecraft anomalous conditions such a s low battery state of charge low voltage sense or exte nded loss of communication result in all instruments being immediately powered off with no advanced shutdown warning Therefore instruments must be designed to  be immediately powered-off from any internal mode in t he event of an instrument over-current or spacecraft a nomalous condition For a violation of the spin-axis Sun-lin e angle the instruments receive a 15 second shutdown warnin g before being powered off. Any additional FM measure s that are specific to the instruments are the responsibil ity of the instruments themselves 2.4.3  Ground Intervention Concept The high-level requirement for limited on-board FM drives the ground intervention concept In an effort to ke ep the FMS as simple as possible on-board FM is minimized  by taking advantage of inherent mission design charact eristics and spacecraft design decisions The spacecraft are  spin stabilized with spin-axis 15-27 deg off the Sun Th e nearSun pointed attitude is the only attitude required to collect the prime science measurements and requires only pe riodic precession maneuvers every ~21days for the duration of the mission in order to be maintained The periodic pre cession maneuvers are dictated by the Earths orbital motio n around the Sun with maneuvers performed when the total Su n offset angle reaches maximum value This orbit offe rs a number of design advantages 1 when combined with antenna coverage out to 70 deg from both sides of s pin-axis frequent ground contacts more than 1/day with neg ligible communication delays are possible, 2\ the near-Sun pointed attitude ensures adequate power generation when att itude is maintained within the maximum offset angle and 3 the inherently stable spin state requires infrequent ad justments to maintain the spacecrafts orientation allowing for openloop attitude control  Since the RBSP spacecraft are near-Sun pointing spi nners inherently stable with open-loop attitude control  there is no on-board capability for the G&C subsystem to autonomously point the spacecraft which significan tly reduces the amount of on-board autonomy required I n general, on-board autonomy is comprised of dedicate d rules that take simple actions such as powering off a com ponent or resetting a component. When possible, the FMS me asures are allocated to hardware to reduce the size of the on-board autonomy rule set Finally the frequent ground con tacts with negligible communication delays allow the burd en for fault correction and recovery to be placed on the g round 


   10 3  Verification  As a distributed system the verification of the RB SP FM requirements was also distributed Verification of subsystem-level FM requirements were captured in th e various subsystem verification plans with buy-in f rom the RBSP FM lead engineer Verification of system-level  FM requirements were performed on the spacecraft and l ed by the FM lead engineer  Requirements for the RBSP mission are organized hierarchically, based upon the missions product br eakdown structure as shown in Figure 9 Requirements are d efined from the mission-level directly to the element-leve l in order to avoid the creation of too many documentation lay ers In addition to the requirement level the requirements  tree is also organized according to requirement type i.e  performance/measurement mission assurance environmental, and interface requirements  Figure 9: RBSP Mission Product Breakdown Structure  The FM requirements are distributed and flow down f rom the Mission Requirements Document MRD to the element-level and then to the subsystem-level The FM requirements are categorized as performance/measure ment requirements which are captured in various requirem ents documents or as interface requirements which are ca ptured in interface control documents ICD Figure 10 sho ws the hierarchy of FM requirements and the categorization  of those requirements   Figure 10: Hierarchy of Fault Management Requirements  Although FM requirements may be verified using test  analysis, demonstration, inspection, or some combin ation of these the preferred verification method for FM requirements is test. The verification of FM requir ements is accomplished through an integrated hierarchical app roach comprised of a series of verification activities D uring the Integration and Test I&T phase verification prog resses from individual components and subsystems to integr ated segments and upward to the entire mission system Individual components are verified by their provide rs against the corresponding component and subsystemlevel fault management requirements The FM lead engineer  has oversight authority over these lower-level FM verif ication activities and has access to all generated verifica tion records and reports. In addition, the FM team performs syst em-level scenario testing and supports mission simulations a nd I&T special tests in order to verify the system-level  i.e mission- and element-level\ FM requirements  The FM team has oversight authority over lower-leve l FM verification activities and reviewed the verificati on plans for spacecraft subsystem and science instrument teams which were allocated FM requirements to ensure that FM requirements are adequately verified FM requiremen ts allocated to hardware \(i.e., spacecraft or ground are verified during box-level and subsystem-level acceptance tes t The individual subsystem teams are responsible for desi gning and running tests that verify these subsystem-level  fault management requirements FM requirements allocated to spacecraft flight software or ground software are v erified by independent acceptance test at the flight software testbed level The Independent Acceptance Test IAT team i s responsible for designing and running the tests tha t verify these subsystem-level FM requirements The tests us ed to perform the verification are typically black box requirements-based tests FM requirements allocated  to spacecraft rule-based autonomy are verified by the autonomy team and autonomy developers on the flight  software testbeds, high-fidelity hardware simulator s, and the spacecraft. The autonomy test campaign is comprised of two phases autonomy unit test phase and autonomy path verification phase Autonomy unit testing is perfor med on the flight software testbeds early in the autonomy development and involves standalone testing of the individual autonomy objects i.e rule macro com puted telemetry, and storage variable\. The goal of the u nit testing is to identify defects such as coding errors before  the autonomy objects are assembled into a complete deli verable autonomy system.  At the conclusion of the unit tes t phase the autonomy system is delivered to the spacecraft and the path verification phase begins Note the autonomy path verification testing is on the leading-edge of the FM scenario testing The autonomy path verification t esting takes place during spacecraft I&T with the purpose of exercising the autonomy system on flight hardware a nd verifying all of the sensor interfaces i.e senso r data used by autonomy rules and computed telemetry and all 


   11 commands emitted by the autonomy system to the flig ht hardware from autonomy macros The paths are independently verified on both spacecraft rather th an endorsing a verification by similarity approach FM requirements allocated to the ground system are ver ified by operational procedure, operational constraint, or b y mission simulation Verification of requirements using oper ational procedure are performed by inspection of the signed off procedure document Verification of requirements us ing operational constraint are performed by inspection of the RBSP Operations Constraint Document Finally verification of requirements using mission simulati ons are performed by test at the observatory level or the h igh fidelity hardware simulator  The FM team has overall responsibility for coordina ting the mission- and element-level verification plans and a ctivities The resulting verification program ensures that the  FMS satisfies the functional requirements and is in con formance with the mission and operational concepts defined f or FM The FM team is responsible for establishing, review ing, and approving all FM verification activities and method s planned for requirements specified at the mission and element-level. All mission- and element-level funct ional and performance requirements will be verified by one or  more appropriate methods prior to launch with closure s tatus tracked in the DOORS requirements database system Whenever possible FM requirements at the mission and element-level are verified by test The FM team is responsible for designing and performing system-lev el scenario tests that verify the mission- and element level FM requirements In addition some FM requirements are  verified using mission simulations which are led by  the Mission Operations Team MOT or I&T special tests which are led by the I&T Team. System-level scenari o tests are developed, designed, and performed by the FM te am to verify mission and element-level FM requirements  The system-level FM tests are scenario based tests that  are similar to mission simulations except that one or m ore faults are injected during the simulation the scenario te sts are black-box requirements-based tests For each scena rio the test must 1 prove that the spacecraft can perform  the scenario correctly \(i.e., without fault injection and \(2\ prove that the spacecraft can recover from the injected f ault to a state in which the MOT can return the spacecraft to nominal operations  As a distributed system the FM test campaign is di vided into two distinct phases as shown in Figure 11 Th e first phase is the subsystem-level test phase in which th e individual subsystems design and run tests to verif y and close their subsystem-level FM requirements \(i.e hardware flight software and autonomy At the conclusion o f the subsystem-level test phase the subsystems are cons idered ready to be delivered to spacecraft I&T and are ava ilable for the second phase of the FM test campaign The secon d phase is the system-level test phase that exercises the FMS as a whole on both spacecraft during I&T. The syste m-level tests serve two purposes 1 verification of missi on and element-level FM requirements and 2 validation of  subsystem-level FM requirements Note  subsystem-l evel FM requirements are verified and closed at the subs ystemlevel prior to I&T      Figure 11:  Fault Protection Test Campaign Overview   System-level scenario testing is performed by the F M team and consists of a series of spacecraft scenarios T he objective of the system-level scenario tests is to verify mission and element-level FM requirements in addi tion many of the subsystem-level requirements are also v alidated as a result of verifying the system-level requireme nts The FM scenario testing consists of three tiers of test ing Tier one tests must be performed on both spacecraft two times baseline and launch site are included on the incompressible test list and are regression tested  on both spacecraft if a hardware configuration change or a significant FSW change affects the test. Tier two t ests must be performed on both spacecraft at least once \(base line\, are included on the incompressible test list and are r egression tested on the high-fidelity hardware simulator or t he affected spacecraft if a hardware configuration cha nge or a significant FSW change affects the test Finally t ier three tests are performed on both spacecraft once \(baseli ne  The baseline configuration for FM scenario testing is when the spacecraft bus is complete with a goal of havi ng instruments integrated The test platform for the b aseline FM testing is I&T; this allows the FMS \(i.e., space craft bus hardware C&DH flight software autonomy and ground/missions operations\ to be exercised as a wh ole and permits the verification of all interfaces between components all autonomy commands via autonomy macros to flight hardware and flight software and  all hardware i.e PDU commands to flight hardware T he high fidelity hardware simulator section 3.1 is u sed whenever possible to dry-run the scenario tests to identify and correct procedural errors and for regression te sting of tier two tests  


   12 The scenario tests are designed through a process o f grouping the FM requirements into sequences. The pr ocess is performed using a requirements-to-test allocatio n matrix in which each requirement is assigned to a test or group of tests The selection of which tests form the incomp ressible test suite is performed through consultation and it eration of the core test list with the systems engineering tea m Following the allocation of all requirements to the  various tests, individual test plans are developed that inc lude a set of starting conditions and high-level outline of test and verification activities. Each test plan includes th e following information test name document number tier desig nation test objective, requirements fully or partially ver ified by the test, minimum spacecraft component set required to run the test, initial conditions for the test, required sup port, planning notes, and the high-level test outline   Figure 12 shows the activity flow for each scenario  test during the system-level test phase  Following the development of the system-level verification and te st plan individual test procedures are generated for each t est. A test procedure is a configuration managed document that describes the detailed information necessary to run  the test on the spacecraft and the list of steps taken to ex ecute the test. The test procedure is also the as-run documen t used by the test conductor or FM lead engineer to document the major milestones of the test When possible the te st procedure will be dry run on the high-fidelity simu lators to identify and correct procedural errors. The test pr ocedure is then executed on the observatory during I&T \(eventu ally the procedure is run on both spacecraft Any deviation s from the test procedure are documented within the test p rocedure as red lines \(i.e., permanent changes to the test p rocedure\ or black lines i.e changes for the current procedur e If the test fails due to test procedure errors the test p rocedure is corrected and the process is repeated However if the test fails due to an implementation error in flight hard ware flight software or autonomy a formal discrepancy is documented in the Anomaly/Problem Failure Reporting  APFR system any changes or corrections to autono my flight software, or hardware are implemented and th e test is re-run until the anomaly is resolved and the test r uns to successful completion After the completion of each  test a review of the test procedure as-run information a nd spacecraft data is performed by a member of the FM team Following the review of the test data, the FM lead engineer signs the test procedure confirming that the test w as run and the review accurately described the success or fail ure of the test  n	\r\n\n  n        n   n\r     n r\r\n\r r\n\r r\r\n\r    0/-1  23  n  4      Figure 12:  Fault Protection System-Level Test Proc ess Flow 4  CONCLUSION The RBSP spacecraft are designed to operate for mul tiple years in the extreme environment of the Earths rad iation belts.  To facilitate this mission, a robust fault management system is integrated into the system architecture f rom the earliest stages of the design.  This fault manageme nt system was rigorously tested during I&T and the results o f this testing show that the RBSP spacecraft are protected against on-orbit fault conditions and therefore have a hig h probability of meeting the mission objectives  The  RBSP fault management design, implementation and test ap proach demonstrate that robust fault-tolerant designs are  achievable for complex systems operating in harsh environments even for systems with only limited or  selective redundancy 5  REFERENCES  1  J   S t r a t t o n  a n d  N   F o x   R a d i a t i o n  B e l t  S t o r m  P robes RBSP\ Mission Overview Proc. of the 2012 IEEE Aerospace Conf.
