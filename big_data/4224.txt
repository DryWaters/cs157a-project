for data relay services. The function of a data relay satellite is to forward data between two elements with which it has established a direct communication link. Currently the infrastructure is based on the ESA ARTEMIS satellite that has been operative since 2003 and that will be at end-of-life by the end of 2010. In this frame Thales Alenia Space Italia \(TAS-I University of Rome “Tor Vergata” \(TOR the new European Second Generation Data Relay Satellite System \(E²GDRSS\based on state of the art and innovative space technologies and telecomm unication techniques.

User Segments include   User Space Terminals, as LEO \(Low Earth Orbit and MEO \(Medium Earth Orbit\ut also launchers   User Earth Mobile and fixed Terminals   Aeronautical users flying up to high stratospheric altitudes, as UAV \(Unma nned Aerial Vehicle Moreover, in the future, the Data Relay satellite System could be a valid support fo r emerging space exploration plans and deep space missions, such as   Moon Exploration in all its phases from the early robotic exploration to human sortie and human outpost phases   
Mars Exploration, in particular the related new robotic exploration phase and the subsequently human exploration, envisaged after 2030 Furthermore, the E²GDRSS will be an autonomous infrastructure and could be c onsidered as a system of systems that has a high relevance with respect to a large strategic services area such as: emergency services for disaster recovery, theatres of war, high level institutional services. In this paper a pre liminary architecture for the new DRS will be presented together with the most important high level capabilities of the system and the innovative technologies and solutions. In the first part of this work a trade off analysis for the identification of the main system 
characteristics will be presented, based on user requirements identified by partitioning users in different categories. A frequency bands analysis em ployed on each service link will be shown, including also the most advanced EHF developments such as the use of Q/V-band \(33-75 GHz i.e., for inter-satellite or deep space user links Afterwards the full architecture will be identified including all the main mission architectural components as Space, Ground a nd User segments. Finally the paper conclusion will be presented 


 2 2  S ECOND GENERATION DRS OBJECTIVES AND NOVELTIES   In order to design such a complex system, some major requirements have been identified. This system has to   supply services to a very large space user population, being a real dual use system able to meet the needs of scientific, commercial and defence customers   use technologies able to increase the communication availability and data rates on each link involved in the system architecture \(inter-orbit links, feeder links, earth users links, etc   guarantee full interoperability with other operational data relay and tracking systems   guarantee backward compatibility towards the user space terminals \(USTs\inals UETs\rrently operating within the Artemisbased DRS   act as enabling constituent of a future ESA in orbit telecommunication infrastructure The preliminary E²GDRSS syst em architecture has been defined considering the following technical drivers   New technological deve lopments of space qualified components for space communications both in optic and RF \(especially EHF, Extremely High Frequency, 30-300 GHz\\(able to provide high performance for the future system services   Technological progress in bandwidth efficient modulation schemes and high protection codes improving overall data rates and services availability   New development in the field of reconfigurable communication links based on PIMT \(Propagation Impairments Mitigation Techniques Adaptive Modulation and Coding Service areas are the combin ation of a permanent wide service area \(extending the actual Artemis European coverage in order to include all the 25 European Countries a theatre spot beams service ar ea \(composed by at least four steerable spot beams system will be able to suppor t different traffic typologies involving on-ground gateway and user stations, such as bidirectional traffic between gateway stations in European countries to/from VSAT terminals and nomadic stations both in European coverage and in theaters of operation broadcast traffic from gateway stations in Europe to nomadic user stations in theatres of operations, point-topoint or point-to-multipoint traffic among nomadic user stations located in theaters or among VSAT terminals in European coverage 3  S YSTEM A RCHITECTURE   The architecture of a space mi ssion is organized into the following component   1  Subjects 2  Orbit 3  Spacecraft platform 4  Payload 5  Launcher 6  Communications architecture 7  Mission operation 8  Ground element  Each component of the architect ure will be analyzed in the following subsections 3.1  S UBJECTS   In this subsection, the E²GDRSS applications, services and potential users will be identified. With respect to application and services the system should provide: wide-band communication, observation data capture and dissemination positioning and timing services and space missions support services. In order to satisfy all services requirements the system should have an high tr affic capacity, availability and reliability. The applications could be divided into scientific ones, such as space and Earth observation, space exploration and manned sp ace vehicles support, and institutional ones, such as security and navigation/positioning. Starting from this applications partitioning, in Table 1 some of  the E²GDRSS potential users have been identified together with the actual service providers 3.2  O RBIT   In general, we can deploy more than one DRS satellite leading to a constellation of DRS satellites. However because of financial constraints, the E²GDRSS will be composed of only one satellite. The orbit of this data relay satellite is selected on the basis of a set of requirements such as: service area and coverage and visibility with the subjects ground stations and service spacecraft\ents are not considered during the orbit selection phase for this kind of services. The DRS sa tellite should allow continuous visibility with Earth stations for data download and maximum visibility with service satellites. Therefore, the conclusion about the orbit type lead to the selection of a GEO \(Geostationary Orbit\rbit. The selection of the longitude for the GEO orbit is dictated by the minimum separation angle with existing satellites in GEO orbit \(at least 1.5 degrees\he location of the ground stations. The geostationary orbital position is currently left as variable parameter to be used in a syst em trade-off analysis to be jointly performed with the sp ace agencies \(ESA and ASI

Table 3 shows a preliminary trade-off carried out to identify the most suitable frequency bands for each link which is characterised on the basis of the corresponding user segment; as it can bee seen for some link the use of innovative frequency bands \(as W band, wherein there are two allocated bands for satellite communications: 71-76 GHz and 81-86 GHz\s foreseen. As previously introduced some ground steerable beams are included in the system architecture

As a matter of fact, the low number of space explorati on missions make it possible to propose the use of an innovative technology such as the W band in a medium term perspective The on-going and the last de ployed space missions have shown important changes in space approach. Many missions dedicated to study the Universe \(operational and planned choose to observe from Earth-trailing heliocentric orbits and from Sun-Earth Lagrange points rather than LEO orbits Moreover, the use of low-cost satellite constellations is envisaged in order to collect data in a coordinated and continuous way. At the same time, missions for planetary exploration increased their duties, moving from simple missions of reconnaissance to detailed investigation of planets through remote sensing At present, an extra space NASA/ASI mission, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter \(MRO\was the last one deployed to Mars to characterize th e surface, subsurface, and atmosphere of the red planet. It s objective is also to identify potential landing sites for future missions. This orbiter hosts some telecommunications systems that will establish a foundation for future spacecraft becoming the first link in a communications bridge back to Earth \("Interplanetary Internet"\It will help the communications of future international spacecraft fleets In addition, the MRO will test the potential of using Ka-band to demonstrate greater performance in communications The future trend of increasing number of missions into deep space determines the growth of data richness and more dataintensive instruments. Moreover, this evolution requires an increase in returned data volumes and  higher data rates envisaging the need of data relay nodes in space W-band could represent an ideal way to answer to these needs, since the trend for space telecommunication systems is the use of higher frequencies, the main reasons being  saturation of  lower frequency bands  growth of data-rate request  reduction of mass and size of equipments Considering that the main disadvantage of the use of Wband frequencies is the additional atmospheric attenuation all its benefits could be fully exploited in space communications. For instance considering the lack of atmosphere on the Moon, we envisage that a future interesting application of this innovative frequency band could be a link between a lande r or a station on the surface of the Moon \(or Mars\ter, that could act as a data-relay node towards an Earth station \(for example, the Deep Space Network 3.4.3  GEO-GEO  With respect to the E²GDRSS satellite – to – GEO link the optical frequency band is selected as a baseline due to the theoretical\very low relative movements between the two satellites. This feature allows to relax the pointing requirements \(critical issue for optical links\and thus to exploit all the potential of optical systems \(it should be mentioned that the great link di stance is a critical issue and it will be analyzed during the next phases of the study Moreover, the W band will be analyzed as a secondary option 3.4.4  GEO-LEO    With respect to the E²GDRSS satellite – to – LEO link the use of Ka band is selected as a baseline and optical band as a secondary choice in order to ensure the interoperability 


 5 and the compatibility with Artemis system and with its user segment Due to the strategic role of EHF band and to the Italian industrial heritage \(acquired during the Italsat scientific Missions\t is proposed the use of Q/V bands as an alternative It should be noted that at present it seems that this typology of satellites represents the major part of the expected user segment of the E²GDRSS 3.4.5  GEO-UAV/HAP  With respect to the E²GDRSS satellite – to – UAV/HAP High Altitude Platform\link the use of W band is selected as a baseline primarily due to   Reduction in mass and size of telecommunication payloads \(and especially of their antennas   The big volume of data produced by technologically advanced instruments requires an high data-rate communication system to deliver this information to the control station   The very narrow beamwidth and the fact that the W-band technology is still a niche one\ake safer and reliable the data transmission  These are key payload features in applications like UAV and HAP communication systems Q/V bands are selected as a secondary option Several operative militar or dual use systems must be considered as potential users of the Data Relay service Such types of systems need a reliable link with respect to induced interferences and charact erized by an high security These requirements suggest the use of high frequencies such as W and Q/V bands.

Alphabus is designed to be compatible with Ariane 5 or any new-generation commercial launcher with a fairing diameter of 5 meters 3.6  C OMMUNICATIONS A RCHITECTURE   The communications architectur e is the configuration of links and the related communication network for the transfer of information between satellites and ground stations. As stated in the ab stract, the function of the DRS satellite is to forward data between two elements. Some examples of these two elements may be   an earth orbiting satellite and an earth station   a Moon \(or Mars station   two earth orbiting satellites   a ground terminal and a space user \(i.e. UAV  These links may be unidirectional or bidirectional command and control links are bidirectional, while links for the transport of data are unidirectional \(towards the ground station\but must support bidirectional communication when error recovery mechanisms such as Automatic Repeat reQuest \(ARQ this case an asymmetric capacity is needed  3.7  M ISSION OPERATION   Once the spacecraft is designed and built, we have to operate it. Getting ready for DRS operations requires extensive advance planning and development of the teams and facilities we need in order to actually conduct the mission.

One of the key element of the future generation of DRS systems is the use of very high frequency bands such as Q/V and even W-bands, since lower frequency bands have saturation problems furthermore high frequencies allow to reduce the size of the users payloads and with respect to the first generation DRS The E²GDRSS future activities will use the baseline introduced in this paper in order to design the full system 5  R EFERENCES    A M o rando, R  Gi ubi l e i  G.

 10 data obtained from the industrial motor test setup. Data was acquired using the experimental fault profile in Figure 15. A snapshot of raw data, including the calculated feature values, is provided in Figure 16 Anomaly Detection\227 The particle filter framework was integrated into LabVIEW to evaluate the real-time performance of the anomaly detector during data acquisition. Shown in Figure 17 is a GUI developed in LabVIEW to manage the anomaly detector settings which include the false alarm rate \(type I error\and false alarm threshold \(type II error  Addi t i onal  confi gurat i on settings include the number of particles used by the particle filter, baseline statistics, fault model, and particle filter update / sample time The results from anomaly detector, using the data shown previously in Figure 16, are provided in Figure 18. The green line represents the confidence of detection based on the false alarm rate and the red line represents the alarm, or detection, threshold as defined earlier in Figure 17. The red dot designates the crossing point during which the red health-state light illuminates to indicate an anomaly has occurred 6  C ONCLUSION  This paper presented a particle-filter based anomaly detector capable of detecting the occurre nce of a major fault mode in its incipient stages for a safe ty critical aircraft actuation system. An overview of a ge neric PHM architecture were presented and applied to a particular EMA fault mode based on an internal FMEA study. The fault mode investigated in detail was a turn-to-turn winding insulation short for a brushless DC motor. The primary fault mode was modeled using physics-of-failure mechan isms indicating the primary failure effect, phase current asymmetry. A feature was derived using a Hilbert transform and statistical analysis to quantify the primary failure eff ect. Then, experimental data was acquired to validate the Simulink simulation model Finally, real-time evaluation of the anomaly detector was performed using LabVIEW  Although a specific system, an EMA, was selected as the test-platform with a specific fault mode, the overall PHM architecture can be applied to an entire range of systems and application domains. In fact, similar techniques which allow  Figure 16\227Plots of experimental data \(top computed features \(bottom experimental test setup using LabVIEW  Figure 17\227LabVIEW interface used to define particle filter settings Figure 18\227Plot of anomaly detection confidence \(top and health state indicator \(bottom\the experimental test setup using LabVIEW 


 11 for early fault detection dur ing acceptable performance in the presence of faults are being developed for a wide variety of system in both manned and unmanned air vehicles Therefore, the concept of usi ng system health information diagnosis and prognosis\n conjunction with reconfigurable control is at the forefront of modern space and avionics applications requiring increasingly sophisticated fault-tolerant systems that are robust, reliable and relatively inexpensive. Ther efore the need arises for a fault-tolerant control architecture to further maximize performance and extend the operating life of COTS components in future avionics systems A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  This work was performed under the United States Air Force USAF\contract number FA8650-06-C-7628.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs. Essentially, Atom Service Casting may be viewed as a more human-friendly approach to UDDI R EFERENCES   NASA and Energy and W a t e r cy cl e St udy NEW S website: http://www.nasa-news.org  R odgers, C  D., and B  J.
