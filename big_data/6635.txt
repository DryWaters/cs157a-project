This paper will review a novel approach for implementing a sec ure hybrid cloud  Specifically public and private cloud entities will be discussed for a hybrid cloud approach The approach is based on extension of virtual Open Systems Interconnection  OSI  Layer 2 switching functions from a private cloud and to publi c clouds, tunneled on an OSI Layer 3 connection. As a result of this hybrid cloud approach, virtual workloads can be migrated from the private cloud to the public cloud and continue to be part of the same Layer 2 domain as in the private cloud  thereby mai ntaining consistent operational paradigms in bot the public and private cloud  This paper will introduce and discuss the virtual switching technologies which are  fundament al  underpinning s of the secure hybrid approach. This paper will not only discuss the  virtual L ayer 2 technical architecture of this approach but also related security components Specifically data in motion security between the public and private clouds and inter  workload secure communication in the public cloud will be revi e we d As pa rt of the hybrid cloud approach security aspects like encrypted communication tunnels key management  and security management will be discussed Moreover management consoles control points  and integration with c loud orchestration systems will also be discussed Additionally hybrid cloud consideration for network services like network firewall server load balancers application accelerators  and network routing functions will be examined  Finally several practical use cases which can be applicable i n the aerospace industry like workload bursting application development environments and Disaster Recovery as a Service will be explored    T ABLE OF C ONTENTS  1.

In this paper, we will introduce an approach based on virtual Layer 2 switching from the private cloud The related aspects of Layer 3 through Layer 7 services and security elements are also impo rtant aspects of this approach   Prior to discussing the hybrid cloud approach in detail, it is prudent to review the motivation behind hybrid clouds and the specific problem sets that hybrid cloud intend to address Enterprise cloud consumers are current ly facing several key challenges    Stronger security in the public cloud    Ambiguous and complex connectivity issues between the private and public cloud  


   978 1 4 673 1813 6/13/$31 00 \251201 4  IEEE  2    Lack of manageability of workloads in the public cloud via private cloud paradigms    Inability to apply internal operation and governance policies on public cloud workloads    Complexity in visibility and control of workloads in public clouds  The hybrid cloud approach claims to address all of these topics with unique approaches This paper discusses one of th ose approaches Typically an enterprise private cloud would like to leverage the benefits of the public cloud, but with the security paradigms that they employ in their private cloud and with control and visibility from a management and cloud orchestratio n point of view   The hybrid cloud approach could provide the ease of public cloud onboarding and off boarding coupled with above mentioned benefits. This approach also benefits the public cloud providers as they can provide innovative approaches to thei r consumers and help develop their install base   The basics of the discussed hybrid cloud approach involves virtualizing basic networking functions namely Layer 2 switching, Layer 3 routing, and Layer 4 through Layer 7 network services including firewal l traffic optimization and the intrusion detection and prevention function Once these functions are virtualized they can coexist in a private and public cloud framework Hence we must address the challenges mentioned above for security and ease of man aging workloads in the public cloud The section below constructs a framework which lays out the components of the hybrid cloud   2  H YBRID C LOUD F RAMEWORK  Anatomy of Framework  Let\325s review the components of the hybrid cloud framework initially from a pri vate cloud aspect   Figure 1 Private Cloud Details in the Hybrid Cloud Framework  As portrayed in the figure above, the private cloud stack from the bottom up consists of the physical infrastructure which consists of network compute and storage Th ese are the essential components of a virtualized data center needed to build aprivate cloud architecture. The compute component is further layered with a virtual machine manager or hypervisor This hypervisor is a key component not only for hosting virtu al machines with a private cloud workload also for running virtual networking instances The virtual machines are communicating to each other in the Layer 2 domain which is provided by a virtual Layer 2 switch. This virtual Layer 2 switch is the fundamen tal underlying component for the hybrid cloud approach. The following sections will discuss how Layer 2 capabilities can be extended in the public cloud which extends the Layer 2 functionalities from the private cloud to the public cloud The private clou d could also have Layer 3 routing and Layer 3 through Layer 7 network services which could be in physical and/or virtual form factors. The above described components have to be managed via  network control functions which will provide inventory creation  migration and key attributes of not only the workload virtual machines, but also the network elements  The top most layer is the cloud portal and orchestration layer which provides a portal for the end user or administrator for the selection of specif ic cloud services that they want to utilize. Once the cloud service is chosen the orchestration function provisions it with the compute network storage virtual machines and any applications and serves it back to the end user OpenStack is a good exam ple of the portal and orchestration layer   Figure 2 Public Cloud Details in the Hybrid Cloud Framework  


   978 1 4 673 1813 6/13/$31 00 \251201 4  IEEE  3  On the opposite side of the framework the public cloud components look very similar to the private components The key point to highlight is that the connection points between the private and public cloud are via a secure Layer 2 extension which is accomplished via extending virtual switching components in the public clouds This extends the workloads in the public cloud within the same Layer 2 dom ain Additionally as show in the above figure, all aspects of connection, runtime workloads, and network services are either secured or provide security functions to the workload The security aspect is critical to this framework and is discussed in detai l in the Security section of this paper. Finally, the network controller in the private cloud would also need to interact with the network controller in the public cloud via APIs that call for public cloud VM management  3  H YBRID C LOUD C OMPONENTS D ECONSTR UCTED  The above section sets the stage for the framework for a hybrid cloud approach. This section reviews the some of the salient components\325 details The paper will then analyze how these components come together in a technical design to solve the key hy brid cloud challenges  Layer 2 Virtual Switch  This subsection reviews the anatomy of a typical virtual Layer 2 switch A typical virtual switch consists of two components, which are very similar to a physical switch namely, control plane and data plane c omponents It has a collection of small functional units which provide the Layer 2 capabilities like the l ayer forwarding engine Virtual Local Area Network  VLAN   t agging and manipulation  and Layer 2 security and segmentation  A virtual switch works in much the same way as a modern Ethernet switch It maintains a MAC:port forwarding table and performs the functions of frame MAC lookup and forwarding to ports Virtual switches have   v irtual p orts which provide logical connectio n points among virtual devices and between virtual and physical devices. Virtual switches also have u plink p orts which are ports associated with physical adapters providing a connection between a virtual network and a physical network In the virtual swi tch the data plane is either embedded as a kernel or a user space module in the hypervisor As shown in Figure 3 these virtual forwarding planes are distributed across all of the private hosts to provide Layer 2 switching functions   Figure 3: Layer 2 virtual switching components  All of the local forwarding decisions are made in the local host hypervisor The virtual machines connect to this virtual switch and all the policies like VLANs, Quality of Service QoS and Access Control Lists ACLs are impl emented at the virtual access ports Similar to the physical switching components the control plane functions run the network operating system, communicate with virtual machine manager and manage the forwarding plane from a control point of view The con trol plane can also be virtualized, or be a  bare metal implementation. The control plane can communicate with the virtual forwarding plane via Layer 2 or Layer 3 connections. The key point to note is the disassociation of the control and forwarding plane in the virtual form factor This will be the underpinning for extending the components in the public cloud  Layer 3 Virtual Router  Similarly a virtual router providers Layer 3 function s  and capabilities for cloud use cases A virtual router has the routin g plane forwarding plane   and I  O complex virtualize d  on a h ypervisor which can interact among each other This virtual router runs like a typical router operating system and provides hosted capabilities like VPN  routing protocols Network Address Translation NAT Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol DHCP ACLs and Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting  AAA   functions  This creates interesting use cases for deployment of a v irtual router in the cloud The software router can be deployed by an enterprise or a cloud provider as a V irtual  M achine VM in a provider hosted cloud A virtual router can be deployed as a single tenant router in virtual form factor for WAN gateway functionality to multi tenant p rovider hosted public clouds The virtual router serves primarily as a router per tenant where by  each tenant gets its own routing instance hence its own VPN connections firewall policies QoS rules access control and so on   


   978 1 4 673 1813 6/13/$31 00 \251201 4  IEEE  4  A common use case for a vi rtual router is VPN service to the tenant edge in the public c loud  enabling an enterprise to connect distributed sites directly to its cloud deployment A v irtual router can serve as a Multiprotocol Label Switching  MPLS   router enabling managed connecti vity from the enterprise site to the cloud deployment. Also, by extending the MPLS WAN deeper into the cloud network the cloud provider can increase network scale 320  more tenants and more networks per tenant There are many other use case s  for a software v irtual router in the cloud  Layer 4 7 Network Services and Service Chaining  Just as n etwork L ayer 2 and L ayer 3 function s  are virtualized  for private and public cloud consumption several L ayer 4 through L ayer 7 functions can also be virtualized These in clude v irtual firewall v irtual load balancer and v irtual application accelerator This section reviews one of these virtual services in some detail namely virtual firewalls  A Virtual Firewall VF  is a firewall service running entirely within a virtua lized form factor on a hypervisor providing the usual packet filtering and monitoring that a physical firewall provides. The VF can be implemented in several ways      S oftware firewall on a guest VM    A  purpose built  virtual security appliance    A v irtual switch with additional security capabilities  Additionally a VF  can be implemented for a common L ayer 3 gateway firewall or a transparent L ayer 2 firewall A VF addresses the invisibility of packets moving inside a hypervisor between virtual machi ne VM to VM\ traffic   Since  the virtual network traffic may never leave the physical host hardware security administrators cannot observe VM to VM traffic The v irtual f irewall also provide s  multi tenancy function s  in a cloud  The VF can also provide fun ctions for an  inter tenant firewall for application segregation  Hence a notion of inter tenant and intra tenant firewall can be leveraged in both public and private clouds VF is thus one of the security mechanisms for hybrid clouds  Typically network se rvices have to be leveraged in a particular sequence for example the firewall load balancer and application acceleration sequence Hence service chaining functionality is required to stitch these services in sequence in a cloud Service chaining allows  multiple network service nodes to be included in a service path so that the packets that belong to a particular flow can travel through all the virtual network service  nodes in the  service chain [3   Typically, a service path consists of an ordered list o f services to be applied to a packet flow and it is used to define the service chain. When a packet reaches a network services  virtual machine with service chaining enabled the packets are intercepted and redirected through the multiple network services i n the specified order. This mechanism acts as an orchestrator of the chain to deliver multiple network services in a cloud environment  Network Controller and Cloud Orchestration  The management aspects of the hybrid cloud are  centered at the n etwork c ontr oller  which resides in the private cloud and provides multiple functions from a control and visibility point of view. It is the central  view of all private and public workloads. It provides  the visibility of private cloud workload via the inventory of virt ual machine manager in the virtual data center Additionally the network controller registers with the public cloud providers and leverages the provider s\325  APIs for basic create, delete   and read workload functions   One of the important functions of the network controller is to move the workload VMs from the private to the public cloud. This is a cold migration, as in, stop and start of the VM The network controller can interface to c loud provisioning and orchestration function s  via API integrations Orchestration software enables automation and orchestration of virtual workloads and virtual network services Automation replaces manual actions with software and executable  scripts for functions like building virtual servers confi guring storage elements network changes and performing other repetitive and expensive tasks Orchestration links a variety of automated tasks together to provision a new service. It is performed using a set of tools and workflow templates that integrate multiple discrete tasks and management actions by providing a software based workflow using standard interfaces   The u ser p ortal defines the user experience Users can order what they need from a menu of standard options using an intuitive portal interfac e for example Amazon.com\. The user portal has two main components the software tool which provides the functions and the governance model which enables the tool Management can control and track each service from the initial request to decommissioni n g enabling self service provisioning of application and infrastructure requests  V ia the self service portal   end user can provide dynamic cloud instantiation functions   4  H YBRID C LOUD A RCHITECTURE  The previous section explains the basic components of the hybrid cloud framework These components come 


   978 1 4 673 1813 6/13/$31 00 \251201 4  IEEE  5  together in a cohesive architecture to deliver the hybrid cloud functionality This section will review this architecture with the above components and additional enhancements  Figure 4 depicts the architecture with components and their associated enhancements The figure shows the enterprise private cloud and the public cloud connected via a Layer 3 connection This connection could be the Internet The enterprise private cloud has the Layer 2 virtual switch, which has the virtual workloads connected The virtual switch consists of a data plane and a control plane which  interact with the network controllers The network controller interacts with a virtual machine manager and th e public cloud for automation and orchestration of workloads   Figure 4: Hybrid Cloud Architecture  Layer 2 Virtual Switched Enhanced  In order to complete the portrayed architecture Layer 2 virtual switches have to be extended to the public cloud This is  made possible by enhancing the traditional data plane components of a virtual switch These enhancements come in the form of virtual machines that are added to this architecture namely virtual switch extender and virtual cloud switch VM  These two comp onents run in the private and the public cloud respectively and act as the extension of virtual switch in the public cloud. The switch extender and cloud switch communicate via a Layer 3 connection over the Internet Since both of these enhancements are in a VM format they can run on any hypervisor for example on VMware ESX or on Amazon\325s public cloud The effect that this has on a private cloud side is that it essentially adds network access ports in the public cloud via switch e xtension   The switch extender and cloud switch modules are managed by the control plane switching element in the private cloud In addition the functions of VLAN extension, port policies, and service chaining can now be extended to the public cloud The switch extender VM com municates to the control plane via a management interface It communicates to the cloud switch VM via tunnel interface and extends the private cloud VLANs via trunked interfaces The cloud switch typically has only one public interface provided by the publ ic cloud provider Hence all tunnels from the private cloud are terminated at this endpoint All communication with the control plane happens from this public interface as well The private interface is used to communicate to the public cloud workload VMs  This private interface extends the VLANs from the enterprise private cloud  Public Cloud Workload Enhanced  Public cloud VM workloads that belong to the enterprises in this architecture are managed by the network controller in the private cloud Hence t he public interfaces on the public workloads are used to communicate to the network controller in the private cloud The private interfaces on public cloud workloads are leveraged to communicate with the cloud virtual switch VM via tunnels that are created  by the public workload network drivers These network drivers are inserted in the public cloud VMs as the enterprise moves the workload to the public cloud thus implying that the private cloud VMs are reformatted with the network driver for the specific public cloud, such as Amazon Web Services This also implies that migration from the private to the public cloud is a cold migration, wherein VMs have to be turned off and moved to the public cloud. These steps are also managed by the network controller in  the private cloud This network driver also provides security functions which are discussed in the following sections  Virtual Router Integration  The above discussed architecture shows a Layer 2 extension of the private cloud into the public cloud Typically, however, an enterprise requires connecting the public and hybrid cloud workload externally either from a branch, campus, or data centers to th e cloud. This requires that a Layer 3 capability in the form of a virtual router be put in place    T he r e  a r e  s e ve r a l  us e s  c a s e s  f or  vi r t ua l  router integration that will be discussed in the aerospace use case discussion section including Virtual Private  Network VPN services and direct internet access for cloud applications  VM Lifecycle and Traffic Flow  Given the above architecture specific attention needs be given to the lifecycle and the traffic flow of the VM across the cloud The lifecycle and tr affic pattern can be studied for organizing operational elements of the hybrid cloud  Let\325s first review the lifecycle of the workload VMs in the enterprise private cloud The network administrator 


   978 1 4 673 1813 6/13/$31 00 \251201 4  IEEE  6  typically sets up the infrastructure for hybrid cloud com ponents whereas the cloud administrator issues hybrid cloud operations Virtual Machine Manager VMM\\(for example vCenter  by VMware  is integrated with network controller functions Hence the enterprise private cloud VM inventory from VMM can be visibl e and managed by the network controller The network controller also manages the switch extender, hybrid cloud switch and public cloud VMs The control plane of the virtual switch is also registered with the network controller It is the central point for  managing the lifecycle of a VM  The two common lifecycle cases are migration to the public cloud and new VM creation in the public cloud. In the case of VM migration the cloud administrator can select the VMs from the network controller and tag them for  migration to the public cloud. As part of the migration the VMs are shutdown reimaged to the public cloud image \(for example, Amazon Machine Image\, including a secure wrapper for secure communication This is followed by the creation of new VMs in the public cloud by the network controller and leveraging the newly formatted image for the new VM in the public cloud. The migration back to the private cloud follows the same steps in reverse  In a  new VM creation, the steps are also similar; the new VM te mplate is created in the network controller and is instantiated in the public cloud. As is evident, the network controller needs to interface with the public cloud for the creation, deletion, and updating of VMs. This is done via the public cloud API integ ration The network controller can invoke these APIs to perform basic public cloud operation functions  The traffic flow from the enterprise private cloud moves along the following path the application data from the private cloud VM flows through the virt ual switch to the switch extender VM to the hybrid cloud switch VM to the public cloud virtual switch to the public cloud VM The traffic follows the same flow in reverse from the public cloud to the private cloud  5  H YBRID C LOUD S ECURITY WITH O THER C ONSI DERATIONS  Network Security  Hybrid cloud security has several components that need to be considered This section will discuss data in transit inter  VM security in the public cloud and Layer 3 through Layer 7 security services components of the hybrid cl oud architecture Figure 5 below portrays the above mentioned security components    Figure 5: Hybrid Cloud Security components  All data in transit between the private cloud and the public cloud is cryptographically isolated and encrypted This is done v ia creating secure network tunnels between the switch extender and the hybrid cloud switch Similarly all the inter VM traffic in the public cloud is also encrypted via tunnels between the VMs a nd  the private cloud The repackaging of an enterprise VM ins erts a driver in the VM to ensure this encryption of  communication between the VMs and cloud switch in the public cloud. The enterprise Network Controller manages and owns all the keys and certificates for data in transit security. Several encryptions and hashing algorithms can be i mplement ed  based on the application requirements and the  most commons ones are  AES 128 GCM AES 128 CBC, AES 256 GCM \(Suite B and AES 256 CBC  The hashing algorithms could include SHA 1 SHA 256 and SHA 384   This hybrid cloud approach also allows you to implement traditional network security elements in virtual routers and in firewalls Since the approach involves extending the Layer 2 network the network services can also be instantiated in the public cloud  Examples include ACLs in virtual routers, firewall rules and access deny lists, and packet filtering and monitoring that a typical p hysical firewall provides  The virtual firewall  can  be implemented in two ways  namely  a common L ayer 3 gateway firewall or a transparent L ayer 2  firewall A virtual firewall addresses the invisibility of packets moving inside a hypervisor between virtual machine VM to VM traffic  since  the virtual network traffic may never leave the physical host hardware, security admin istrators cannot observe VM to VM traffic The v irtual f irewall also supports  multi tenancy in a cloud by providing inter tenant firewall  functionality  for application segregation  As shown in Figure 5, the service chaining of the Layer 4 though Layer 7 vi rtual services can be implemented not only within the public cloud, but also across the cloud in a hybrid fashion  


   978 1 4 673 1813 6/13/$31 00 \251201 4  IEEE  7  Additional considerations  In addition to security and operational aspects of the hybrid cloud approach there are several other considerations to review. The approach is very dependent on the nature of the applications that one could seek to deploy in a hybrid cloud In other words  not all applications are suitable for a hybrid cloud approach. For example one could deploy web and application tiers in the public cloud and keep the database tier in the private cloud  Similarly the nature of the actual workload should be considered  the operating system to be deployed the storage elements the image size for migration application latency requirements, and the relationship and dependencies of the workloads on other applications Consequently connectivity considerations like intran et and extranet bandwidth, latency, and availability between private and public cloud also need to be reviewed Regarding security, data at rest security, specifically, data storage volumes in the cloud need to be protected Finally Service Level Agreemen ts SLAs for applications need to be carefully considered when deploying in a hybrid cloud fashion  6  A EROSPACE H YBRID C LOUD U SE C ASES  There are several use cases that can be implemented via the hybrid cloud approach. Below are a few use cases that coul d be leveraged by the aerospace industry and other industries as well  Mission workload bursting  The hybrid cloud can be leveraged for unexpected cyclical or pre planned demand for mission workloads 5  T h i s  i s  e s s e n t i a l l y  a  c a p a c i t y  a u g m e n t a t i o n  t e c h n ique for any mission or research application. Organizations can use the public cloud capacity in burst scenarios while keeping control of the applications securely In this use case a user can migrate or start a new VM from the private cloud and add stre ngth to the application for a given period of time. The bursting use case can apply to many applications, including video analytics, sensor data analytics distributed modeling and simulation applications  Aerospace software development and testing  A com mon use case for the hybrid cloud could be development and test workloads. In this case, developers and testers can leverage a self service platform on top of a network controller to deploy test workloads This would provide them with the same experience a s they would get in a private setting. Current testing tools can be integrated to this approach. This would provide shortened and faster development cycles for software development teams and enable them to  create new testing scenarios very quickly  Upgra de and Migration  Another common use case for the hybrid cloud could be for software application and infrastructure upgrades and migrations The scenario is typically used to gather capacity in production or standby mode while planning and implementing sof tware applications upgrades and/or data center upgrades  Disaster Readiness and Avoidance  Dis aster recovery DR and business continuity is an important aspect of any mission or enterprise. The hybrid cloud approach can provide the public cloud as a DR s ite to create and bring up workload in case of a failure. This scenario could be a better approach than some traditional DR services which would require pre provisioning of resources  Remote access to Cloud  By deploying a hybrid cloud  enterprise remote o ffice s  and branch es  can have direct VPN access into the cloud hosted applications without back hauling through an existing data center This is possible via the integration of a virtual router with the cloud hosted applications This approach could reduce  latency and costly private WAN services Examples include desktop deployment for temporary workforce Internet facing application access and VPN services in the cloud  The above use cases are a sample list that could apply to not only aerospace but to a ny enterprise looking to be more responsive to their missions and business. These use cases are based on the premise that the hybrid cloud provides security flexibility and consistency of operations from private to public clouds   7  S UMMARY  Hybrid clo ud approaches are being investigated developed and adopted by the user and cloud provider communities The advantages are quite compelling for organizations and user communities like aerospace, which could benefit from r apid provisioning  c ost optimizati on scalability of applications and processes, and the ability to r etain security and control  within the mission or business organization Additionally for the cloud provider community this approach provides new services and advanced on boarding capabili ties to the user community  This paper has focused on extending a private cloud to a single public cloud However the same approach can be applied to extend the private cloud to multiple public clouds or from a public cloud to other public clouds. The 


   978 1 4 673 1813 6/13/$31 00 \251201 4  IEEE  8  not ions of cloud brokers can also be envisioned via this approach, where one can extend private cloud based on a specific need or particular decision criteria  Most of the techniques and use cases mentioned in this paper are novel and emerging therefore car eful efforts should be made in evaluating these techniques before their adoption perhaps preceded by a use case analysis followed by developing an architecture and a conducting a prototype evaluation Although still in its adoption phase  there is a grea t deal of optimism that hybrid  approaches will make cloud applications  more flexible dynamic and cost efficient while greatly simplifying operational complexity  R EFERENCES  1  Hybrid Cloud definition http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800 146/sp800 146.pdf  2 H a s a n   M    C h a r  D    F a h e d   L    T u c k e r  L    M o rro w   M., Malyon A framework for controlling Mult itenant Isolation, Connectivity and  Reachabili ty in a Hybrid  Cloud Environment  http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft masum chari shc 00  3 Guichard, J., Kumar, S Quinn, P., Smith, M., Yadav N December 2013.

    11   Figure 21 Tail functions for the spacecraft power consumption \(due to data availability only ADCS components and avionics board are considered in this plot\. The plot shows results for data statistic, two expert statistics \(proportional and bisection weights\ and two Bayesian statistics. The vertical dotted and dashed lines indicate t he estimates at PDR and CDR. It can be noticed that in this case the statistics \(especially Bayesian\ fail in recognizing the underestimation at PDR  Differently from the other cases the risk analysis for the total power consumption shows some problems Specifically the statistics do not seem to identify the underestimation of the initial PDR estimate  The cause of this issue depends mostly on the estimates of the power consumption for the ADCS components, since the estimates of the power consumption for the avionics board seem to be more accurate Future work will focus on improving estimates for the ADCS components maybe developing a specific expert elicitation interview with control experts only  The last results of this paper were computed performing the analysis of variance The analysis considers how the variance of each factor component or subsystem affects the total variance The objective of this analysis is to identify the main drivers for mass and power fluctuations To compute the analysis [4   th e h y p o t h esi s  o f  i n d ep en d en c e between the distributions of the single components is assumed Hence the variance of fluctuations for mass and power is the sum of the single variances   4  5  The variance proportions coefficients are defined as the ratio of the variance of each component to the total variance They are computed as  6  7  The coefficients for mass fluctuations are shown in Figure 22  The coefficients for power fluctuations are shown in Figure 23     Figure 22 Analysis of variance for the spacecraft mass estimates. According to all the statistics, the components of the control system together with the avionics board seem to be the components that show the biggest variance in their estimation  


    12   Figure 23 Analysis of variance for the spacecraft power consumption estimates. The statistics offer different results on which component seems to be the principle driver for the variance of the power consumption estimate  Analysis of variance shows that all the statistics identify ADCS and avionics board components as the major drivers for the variance in the estimation of the total mass Regarding the power consumption, the analysis of variance presents conflicting results according to experts and Bayesian statistics the ADCS subsystem is the main driver of the variance, while according to data statistic the avionics board is the main driver This difference can also be correlated with the issues observed in the total powe r consumption probability density function Figure 20 and 21 Future work will focus on a more detailed analysis of the control system for the spacecraft A final comment is related to the weighting of the distributions In this analysis two weighting schemes have been used the proportional scheme and the bisection scheme While in previous works focused on communication system design only  1   5    3    4   the bisection rule achieved substantially better results in the case of this paper the two methods provide very similar outcomes and they both give reasonable estimates However since this is the first case in which the methodology has been applied by the authors to the entire spacecraft design, it is too early to claim that in all the cases the two schemes will perform in the same way More test cases need to be analyzed and additional interviews with experts need to be performed  Conclusions and suggestions for future work are presented in the next section  4  C ONCLUSIONS  This paper presents the first attempt to extend the probabilistic approach to design risk to the entire spacecraft design This approach has been developed initially by the authors primarily for the design of the communication subsystem. In this paper, the authors extend the approach to the different subsystems and focus their effort on small spacecraft which are becoming increasingly more developed in academia space agencies and industries The methodology is extended to the entire spacecraft the database now includes data on several spacecraft components and the expert elicitation interview includes questions on the different subsystems. A university satellite mission \(CASTOR\ developed at MIT is used as a test case Results show that the methodology is effective in analyzing each component and in identifying whether the initial estimate of mass and power consumption made at PDR was an overestimation or an underestimation Specifically the tail functions provide useful insights which can be applied by the engineers while designing the spacecraft. The system results are obtained by convolution of the results obtained for the single components and they show that the model is able to clearly identify underestimation for the spacecraft mass while it does not perform as well for the power consumption. Similar results are obtained in the analysis of variance proportions Future work will be dedicated to analyzing the issue on the power consumption estimate as well as in developing specific statistic al  approaches to include newly developed payloads for which no previous data are available or for which expertise in the field is somehow limited Finally future work will also focus on extending the model to the design of larger spacecraft than small satellites and to the design of satellite constellations  5 ACKNOWLEDGMENT  Part of this work was performed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Part of this work was carried out at the Space System Laboratory Massachusetts Institute of Technology 6 APPENDIX  A breakdown of mass and power consumption data for each of the components at PDR and CDR is shown in the following table Table 2: Values of mass and power consumption at PDR and CDR for each of the components analyzed Component  Mass PDR Kg  Mass CDR Kg  Power PDR W  Power CDR W  Solar Panel  3.34  5.066  0  0
