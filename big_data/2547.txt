Abstract— In this paper, the system presents an integrated\nwireless sensor network \(WSN information\nfrom  agriculture  systems  namely  temperature,  humidity,\npondus  hydrogenii \(pH The  purpose  is to\nprovide a faster and more convenient platform for the client\nto obtain information from an array of sensor nodes that has\nbeen set-up in an agricultural system. A WSN will collect\nthe values of various parameters from the front-end sensors\nat the host end. At the client sides, one can use the internet\nto request for Web Services that will store this big data into\ndistributed SQL databases which are already in our proposed\ncloud system. In addition, this work presents the concept of\ncloud computing and services.  The benefits of this system\ninclude basic computing hardware  and reasonable  storage\ncapacities making it suitable for any smart device which can\nmonitor real-time  farmland  information  anywhere.  The\ncustomers can fully access our  cloud  service using devices\nthat have internet capabilities.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nIRELESS sensor network \(WSN communication network. Usually, it can achieve\nsmall size, low cost, low power consumption, fewer network\ncomponents and other features easily. In recent years, it has\nbeen readily  implemented  in agriculture,  industry,\nenvironmental protection and other fields.\nW\nWith  the  development  of  hardware limitations,  and  in\npursuit  of  a  better  performance and  enhancing  greater\ncomputing capability, people turn to find other techniques to\nachieve these goals. Therefore, the concept of “Cloud” was\nborn. In fact, as early as the Internet appeared, the “Cloud”\nhas already existed silently providing for us some services.\nIn recent  years,  the  “Cloud” concept  has  become  more\nand more popular, especially on the business sector There\nare also many types of cloud computing platforms such as\nGoogle,  Amazon,  IBM,  and Microsoft…etc However, the\ntrue  essence  of  using  “clouds”  was  not  completely\nunderstood. “Cloud” was then not a specific technology but\nrather a concept.\nII. CLOUD COMPUTING\n“Cloud” refers to a network. In the beginning engineers\ndrew a network diagram in the form of a cloud to represent\nWide  Area  Network.  This  had  an undefined  volume  of\ninterconnected computers and network routers [1]. So to the\nclient,  this  “cloud”  was just  a  means  of  interacting  with\nother sides.\nA. Distributed Computing\nAccording  to  literal interpretation [2], the  idea  of\ndistributed computing is to divide the whole work load into\nsmaller  units Each  work  fragment  will  be  given  to  a\ncorresponding  slave  computer  that  will  do  the computing\nand then will send back the results to the master computer.\nThis is shown in Fig. 2.\nFig. 1.

Distributed computing\nThrough this technique,  cloud computing can achieve a\nsimilar processing power to that of a “Super computer with\nrelatively lower cost and lesser fabrication complexity. \nB. Virtualization Technology\nVirtualization is a kind of software technology which can\nbe applied to many fields. In fact, the concept of “Cloud”\nappeared very  early  [3],  but  due  to  lack  of  network\nbandwidth,  insufficient  storage  space,  and premature\nvirtualization  technology  it  was  unstable  and  lacked\nflexibility.\nHowever,  with  the development of  virtualization\ntechnology, the development of clouds has been accelerated.\nIn  the  past,  our computing power  was  based  on personal\ncomputers locally, but through virtualization technology we\ncan now use cloud computing power which is centralized.\nThe proposed  cloud system consists  of  a  master server\ncomputer and four virtual slave server computers. The data\nare distributed onto the respective storage spaces of the four\nslave server computers which shall be used in the distributed\ncomputing process.\nIII DATABASE DESIGN\nA. Database Concept\n   Database refers to a particular subject or a theme arranged\nin  a structured  set  of  multiple  and  complex  data  in  the\ncomputer.  As  a  storage  structure,  the database  can  be\nbroadly divided into: Hierarchical, Network, Relational, and\nObject-oriented. We used relational database in our project.\nRelational  database  is  a  database  that  has  a  collection  of\ntables of  data  items  which  are  formally  described  and\norganized based on the relational model. In this model each\ntable must identify a column or group of columns referred to\nas  the  "primary  key"  to  uniquely identify  each  row. The\nrows  of  one  table  can  relate  to  rows  of  another  by\nestablishing a "foreign key" which is a column or group of\ncolumns  in  one  table  that  points  to  the  primary  key  of\nanother table. \nB. Stored Procedure\nThe  Stored  Procedure \(SP Update,  Delete,  and Select  in  the\ndatabase. These basic instructions can also control the data\nin the database and even combine more complex instructions\nso that  the  user  can  handle  data more  efficiently 


In  this\nproject, we used T-SQL to write the database instructions.\nEvery time one accesses a regular database, it has to check\nthe  syntax and  this  consumes  a  lot  of  time.  So  we\nimplemented another technology that is “Stored procedure”\nwhich is written using T-SQL. Stored procedure will process\nthe composition, verify the syntax by T-SQL, and then store.\nAfter that, one just needs to use it directly.\nIV WEB SERVICE DESIGN\nA. Web Service Concept\nWith  XML  \(Extensible  Markup  Language Simple  Object Access  Protocol Web  Service\nDescription  Language Universal  Description,\nDiscovery  and Integration distributed\ncomputing technology, and  Web Services  were born.  Web\nService through the open-type standard e.g. XML, SOAP...\netc other  applications.  Web  Service\nconsists  of  reusable  components  that  can  be  published,\ndiscovered and invoked across the Web [4]. \nFig. 3.  Cloud system structure\nFig. 4.  Stored procedure’s concept\nIts basic function is to respond to the call from the client\nto the  server.  Its purpose  is  to  let  the  application from\ndifferent  platforms  intercommunicate.  When  using  the\nprogram, one inputs a value onto it, and then the program\nwill request the Web Service to compute. The project used\nC# to design the user interface; while the platform was built\n878 PROCEEDINGS OF THE FEDCSIS. KRAKO´W, 2013\nusing .NET that can do the integration and implement the\napplication.\nB. Related Technologies\nXML is a language form and a kind of syntax which can\neasily be read by the user and that the computer program can\neasily  identify.  It  emanated  from  the SGML \(Standard\nGeneralized Markup Language formerly known as\nSGML Editorial Review Board; and so, XML is reviewed by\na group of SGML experts. XML does not replace HTML.\nHTML focuses on how the file appears in the browser; while\nXML focuses on how to represent them in a structured way.\nSOAP, Simple Object Access Protocol, SOAP is a kind of\nprotocol that defines the way XML data are delivered and\nthe various transmission protocols, like HTTP, FTP, SMTP,\nand TCP. SOAP uses XML as the data transmission format,\nand  combines  with  the  aforementioned  transmission\nprotocols to send the message.\nC. LINQ-to-SQL\nLINQ  is  a  kind  of  method  to  link  different  program\nlanguages.  Without  LINQ it  is  hard  to  establish  a\ncommunication  link  between  the  SQL  database  and  the\nprogramming language.  LINQ  can  do  object-oriented\nprogramming; it can also make the T-SQL language easily\nreadable in C#, where the basic language is different; and it\ncan also automatically generate the corresponding data type.\nV.USER CONTROL CENTER\nThe  relationship  between  user  control  center  and  Web\nService  are  divided into  two  directions:  “data”  and\n“Panorama Map”.\nA. Data Curve\nDue  to  the  large  amount  of  data coming  from  the\nfront-end sensors of temperature, humidity, and pH value…\netc., a virtual machine is therefore used as a storage medium\nwhose contents shall later be extracted via the Web Service.\nThe  process is  as  follows:  one  will  first  get  the  display\nwindow size to the Web Service,  then he will  extract the\nquantity  of  data  from  the  database.  The  cloud  will  then\ncompute the result which will be fitted onto the screen. [5]\nB. Panorama Map\nBecause the farm we can monitor can be of large scale\ncovering  entire Taiwan  or  even  the  whole  world,  we\ntherefore made reference to the operation of Google map. At\nfirst the program will  send the start  instruction to let  the\ncloud side know the user  side’s display window size,  and\nthen the cloud will  compute the image result  and relay it\nback to the user control center.\nSeven parameters have been designed to operate the map,\nnamely:  user  control  center’s  display  window  width and\nheight, X and Y coordinates of present location map, X and\nY  coordinates  of  displacement,  and  the presented  map\nhierarchy.\nWhen  the  user  zooms  in  or  out  of  the  map,  the  user\ncontrol  center  will send  the  new  map’s  hierarchical\nparameters  to  the  cloud  to regain  the  map.  As  the  map’s\ndisplay is  maximized,  it  will  show  the  images  of  the\nfarmland as well as the corresponding sensor information.\nWhen the sensor is clicked, the user will get its information\nand data.\nC. Interface\nThe design of the data curve is divided into three parts,\nnamely:  initial, static and dynamic.  Regardless  of whether\nthe user starts the user control center or changes the window\nsize,  the  coding  of  the  initial status  will  still  redraw  the\nscreen. It  will calculate the window size, split the X axis,\nand then use the amount of data it gets from the Web Service\nto calculate the initial screen size.\nFig. 5.  Web Service concept\nFig. 6.  LINQ-to-SQL concept\nFig. 7.  Relation between data curve and data\nThe  design  of  the relational  database  involves  two\nconcepts: one is that the data in the database should not be\nmultiple repetitions,  and  the  other  is  that  two  separated\nWEN-YAW CHUNG, PEI-SHAN YU, CHAO-JEN HUANG: CLOUD COMPUTING SYSTEM BASED ON WIRELESS SENSOR 879\ntables should be established with a correct relation to ensure\nthe  consistency.  A good  database  design  depends  on  its\ncharacteristics. Because of the related characteristics,  data\nduplication between tables can be minimized.  This design\nresults  into  saving  the storage  space  and  establishing  a\ncorrect  relation.  Hence,  one  doesn’t  need  to  modify  each\ndata 


over and over again.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nThe system proposed an internet database design by using\nthe SQL database LINQ-to-SQL technique,  Web Service,\nvirtualization  technology  and  C#  interface.  By  using  this\npaper’s method,  the  client’s  end  can  monitor  the\nenvironmental  condition  of  the  agricultural  place  at any\nplace. The major elements of this work are wireless network\napplications,  C  #  interface,  cloud computing  system,\ndatabase design, Web Service, and user control center.\nData packets were sent via a USB connection to the host-\nend  which  transmits  the  values  of  various  environmental\nparameters coming from the front-end sensors. The number\nof WSN nodes can be more than 600,000 and each node can\nreturn  the  value for  every  one  second.  Therefore,  the\ndatabase will become enormous. The issue of quick access\nof information at the client end has been addressed by our\nsystem.  C# interface  will  be  designed  to display the  data\ncurve  which will  aid in the decision making of  the client\nwith regard  to getting better  yield from his farm.  Besides\nthis, the sensor data will be uploaded to the cloud database\nallowing the client to use our Cloud Service as long as the\nuser’s display facility has internet connectivity.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe proponents of this work would like to acknowledge\nthe National Science Council, Taiwan, ROC for funding this\nproject \(NSC 102-2221-E-033-066 Implementation Center\n\(CIC control center interface \nFig. 10.

velocity test results are presented in the next \nsection. \n  5 \n \n4. MOBILE APPLICATION TESTING  \nThe first mobile applications testing of AeroMACS was \nperformed using a Boeing 737-700 that was provided by \nBoeing from their corporate fleet.  These activities \nconstituted the first use of AeroMACS using an actual naircraft, including use of an antenna designed for aircraft \nuse [14, 16]. The aircraft tests also differed from the ARV \ntesting by offering significantly greater antenna height \nplacement and vehicle velocities.  The activities \ndemonstrated the first two-way AeroMACS data link \nservice providing flight critical data.  \nThe aircraft was fitted with a Sensor Systems S65-5366-720 \n5 GHz antenna, temporarily replacing the standard VHF nblade antenna as shown in Figure 4.  The ARV’s subscriber \nunit, a prototype AeroMACS unit with external antenna \nleads was installed in the aircraft and connected to the 5GHz \nantenna.  United Airlines provided hangar facilities for \nmaking the necessary onboard modifications. \n \nFigure 4 – Boeing 737-700 Aircraft Used for AeroMACS \nMobility Testing Showing Location of AeroMACS \nAntenna. \n \nThe AeroMACS subscriber station onboard the Boeing 737-\n700 was configured to associate with base station sector 2-3 \nof the base station located at the ARFF facility on the \neastern side of CLE \(see Figure 1 coverage to the north and south of the \nsectors 270 degree heading. \nTwo activities were performed using this configuration.  \nThe first activity consisted of characterizing the  \nperformance of AeroMACS onboard a Boeing 737-700 by \nrepeating a subset of the drive test scenarios previously \nconducted with the ARV for the AeroMACS baseline tests \ndescribed in the previous section. Tests were performed \nusing similar airport surface and runway routes at velocities \nup to 80 kts.  The second activity further validated the \nperformance of AeroMACS by demonstrating the successful \nuse of safety critical aeronautical mobile applications using \nAeroMACS as the application data link.  For both activities, \nthe aircraft remained on the ground in taxi mode in the gate, \nterminal and taxi areas and on Runway 24L \(see Figure 1 AeroMACS. \nThe Boeing 737-700 performance characterization resulted \nin the collection of AeroMACS performance data enabling a \ncomparison with the baseline ARV test data.  This \ncomparison revealed that the Boeing737-700 installed \nAeroMACS system had performance characteristics similar \nto the results obtained during the ARC testing.  Of interest \nare the aircraft taxi tests as a function of velocity.  A small \nthroughput performance dependency with vehicle velocity \nwas measured as aircraft speeds increased above 40 kts. \nTable 4 shows the average throughput as a function of \nvelocity.  Figure 5 shows the effects of vehicle velocity as \nthe aircraft travelled down Runway 24L.  The effects of \nproximity to the base station are visible in this figure as \nwell, with the base station location approximately one-third \nof the distance from the northeast end of Runway 24 L \(see \nFigure 1 kts as required by \nAeroMACS Profile \(see Section 6 nSpeed \n \nSpeed, kts \n \nVehicle \nAverage Throughput, \nMbps \n40 ARV 4.7 \n40 Boeing 737 4.8 \n60 Boeing 737 4.2 n80 Boeing 737 3.9 \n \n \n \nFigure 5 – Effects of Vehicle Velocity on Throughput \nfrom Runway 24L Taxi Tests. \n nThe AeroMACS validation activity required a suitable air \ntraffic control or air traffic services application over \nAeroMACS to the Boeing 737-700 as it taxied across the \nairport surface.  This effectively demonstrated the \nperformance and feasibility of AeroMACS for safety critical \nmobility applications.  The selection of an appropriate \napplication was influenced by operational continuity \n  6 \nconsiderations, including FAA plans to implement early \ndata communications capabilities over VDL Mode 2 as part \nof the FAA’s DataComm Program Other considerations \nincluded the maturity of the data link service definition, the \nservice availability whether or not the service currently \nexists or can be suitably emulated integration considerations. \nThe application chosen to validate the AeroMACS \ntechnology was a navAero T-1000 Electronic Flight Bag \n\(EFB capable of presenting  \ncockpit staff  with critical en-route meteorological data such \nas AIRMETs \(Airmen's Meteorological information Significant Meteorological Information through Meteorological Aerodrome \nReports \(METARS radar graphic with  textual METARs \ninset  for CLE. \n \nFigure 6 - A sample Weather screen showing radar \(with nimpending rain satellite radio receiver which utilizes a 100BaseT \nEthernet connection to interface the unit to an EFB or nmultifunction display \(MFD however \nthe intended demonstration consisted of interfacing the \nsatellite receiver unit into the AeroMACS testbed and \nutilizing  the wireless data link to provide "last mile"  \nservices to the cockpit. Due to a satellite receiver failure, the \nconfiguration was further altered to utilize AeroMACS  to \nconnect to WSI demonstration system connected  to  the \ninternet. \nWSI's InFlight EFB weather application caches the npacketized information broadcast over the Sirius satellite \nsystem.  For timely information, the entire 


system, from \nreceiver to EFB, should be on receiving broadcast updates.  \nWith SIRIUS data rates confined to 64kbps and below, the \n4 Mbps average  throughput  of the AeroMACS system's \nwireless data link component to aircraft, or even  the \n1.44mbps interface  to  the Internet,  had  no negative \nimpact  upon  the demonstration  application. \n \n5. SAFETY CRITICAL FIXED ASSET TESTING \nThe opportunity to test AeroMACS using an actual critical \nfixed application was presented when Cleveland FAA \ninitiated plans for the construction of a new Air Traffic \nControl Tower \(ATCT facility was determined to be \nin close proximity to the ASR-9 system.  As a consequence \nof the new ATCT construction location, the existing radar \nsensor was scheduled for displacement to a location north of \nthe airport.  To enable seamless air traffic operations, the \nFAA operates an existing surveillance facility until a new \nradar system is built, optimized and thoroughly tested.  The \nscheduled change of surveillance systems at Cleveland \nairport gave rise to the opportunity for testing AeroMACS \nutilizing the radar system scheduled for removal.  With the \napproval and cooperation from FAA CLE Radar System \nSupport Center \(SSC formulated to integrate \nAeroMACS into the communications infrastructure at \nCleveland airport, interface it with the surveillance system \nand subsystems and conduct testing. \n \nIn preparation for testing in a relevant environment, \ncommunications equipment was obtained to conduct initial \nequipment setup and testing at a NASA GRC laboratory.  \nLaboratory equipment configuration and layout was \ndesigned to replicate surveillance communications \nrequirements at ASR-9 radar facilities.  Laboratory \nequipment consisted of AeroMACS subscriber stations, \nCodex 3600 modems, Newbridge 3624 Channel bank \nsystems and media converter equipment The scope of the \nlaboratory test was to configure modems and channel bank \nsystems to transport information at the correct data rates \nwhile adhering to communication protocols in use.  \nAeroMACS uses Transmission Control Protocol/Internet \nProtocol \(TCP/IP use by telecommunications \nequipment commonly use T1 or DS-0 levels \(1.544Mbps information between the T1 \nchannel bank system interface and IP interface provided by \nAeroMACS, a media converter system was used.  The \nmedia converter unit was able to packetize T1 channels and \nprovide timing signals for end-to-end channel bank \noperation.  In laboratory testing, the AeroMACS system was \nable to transport 24 channels of a T1 system.  Error free \nend-to-end bit error rate tests were conducted and the nlaboratory system configuration was successfully tested \nunder different data rate load configurations and with \ndifferent modem parameters. \n \nStarting in April of 2012, NASA and FAA personnel \nproceeded to install AeroMACS equipment at the ASR-9 \nsurveillance facility and ATCT.  The AeroMACS subscriber \nstation was deployed at the radar tower structure and the \nPower Over Ethernet \(POE nBank were installed in the radar building.  The POE and \nAeroMACS SS were connected using Ethernet cabling At \nthe ATCT, an AeroMACS subscriber station was installed \non top of the Mezzanine building and cabled to the FAA \nequipment room where the Newbridge Channel Bank and \nPOE where deployed.  The wireless configuration utilized \nthe base station to connect the subscriber station deployed at \nthe ATCT and subscriber station deployed at ASR facility \nas shown in Figure 7.  Although an actual National Airspace \nSystem deployment will not utilize a two-hop configuration, \nthe NASA test bed AeroMACS prototype system did not \noffer a single hop architecture option.  Bit error rate tests  \nwere conducted employing loading and configurations used \nin the earlier laboratory tests, showing zero bit errors \ngenerated during the data transmission. \n \n \nFigure 7 Wireless Configuration for ASR-9 Safety \nCritical Fixed Asset Tests. \n \nThe new surveillance system in Cleveland was \ncommissioned in July 2012, thus freeing up the old radar \nsystem for AeroMACS testing.  At the ASR-9 location, the \nAeroMACS subscriber station was interfaced to the ASR-9 \nRacal modem systems through the existing Data Probe \nswitching system.  At the ATCT the AeroMACS subscriber \nstation was interfaced to the corresponding modem systems \nas shown in Figure 8.  To monitor the performance of the \ncommunications system a radar analysis tool \(WRTADS deployed at both the ASR-9 and ATCT \nlocations.  At the ASR-9 location, the radar analysis tool \nwas connected to the Communications Radar Interface Box \nwhere tracks produced by the radar system could be \nrecorded for post processing.  At the ATCT, the radar \nanalysis tool was connected to the Serial Communications \nInterface Panel where received radar tracks were recorded \nfor post processing and comparison with recordings at the nsensor location.  The testing indicated that the AeroMACS \nsystem was successfully able to transport critical radar \ninformation from the radar source to the ATCT.  Figure 9 \nillustrates the performance of the voice grade line \nperformance.  The loss performance from 400 Hz to 3000Hz \nis negligible and illustrates the signal quality being provided \nto the modem system.    \n \nFuture AeroMACS evaluations will include testing of \nsystem performance utilizing a single hop wireless \nconfiguration.  This configuration would enable the \nevaluation of system latency under high communications \ndemand loading using shared services configuration.  The \nfixed 


asset testing successfully demonstrated that \nAeroMACS is able to meet the requirements for \ntransporting critical surveillance data in a reliable and \nefficient way.        \n \n \n \nFigure 8 – AeroMACS-ATCT-ASR-9 Interfaces \n \n \n \n \nFigure 9 – AeroMACS-ASR-9 Test Voice Grade Line \nPerformance \n \n \n6. AEROMACS STANDARDS DEVELOPMENT \nWorldwide interoperability is a critical element in the \ndesign of AeroMACS technology.  AeroMACS will be \nrequired to provide seamless worldwide communications \nservices while meeting the needs of many different users. \nCollaborative efforts to standardize AeroMACS are \n  8 \nconcurrently taking place in the United States and Europe. \nIn the United States Radio Technical Commission for \nAeronautics \(RTCA Committee \(SC MOPS WiMAX Forum \nhas established a working group to address aviation \ninterests.

With support \nfrom industry, government, EUROCONTROL and WG-82 \nthe U.S. final draft profile was completed at the end of \n2010.  The AeroMACS profile is a joint RTCA and \nEUROCAE development effort based on the WIMAX \ndocument, WiMAX Release 1 System Profile.  This airport \nwireless communications technology has been developed \nbased on a specific WiMAX Forum profile of the IEEE \n802.16-2009 standard.  Use of an established IEEE standard \nenables the aviation community to leverage extensive ninternational standards collaboration and commercially \nprovided components and services.  The profile document \nspecifies the use of selected 802.16-2009 technical \nparameters that best serve the aviation needs Parameters \nhave been selected to meet mobile station requirements \nconsidering different users, varied environments and \noperational uses.  The AeroMACS profile closely follows \nthe format of profiles developed by the WiMAX Forum® \nfor commercial and industrial use and is expected to be \nincorporated as one of several WiMAX Forum Certified \nprofiles.  Airborne MOPS development started in 2011 and \nis scheduled to conclude in late 2012.  MOPS objectives are \nto develop standards for both Airborne Component and \nGround Based base station components of AeroMACS. \n \nWiMAX Forum \n \nThe WiMAX Forum is an industry-led, not-for-profit norganization that certifies and promotes the compatibility \nand interoperability of broadband wireless products based \nupon IEEE Standard 802.16.

SUMMARY  \nThe need for an integrated wireless communications \nnetwork capability for the airport surface has been \nrecognized since the 1990s, and several research and study nefforts have advanced the concept.  Requirements analyses \nprovided the airport surface communications spectrum \nrequirements, and interference and spectrum sharing studies \nproved the feasibility of adding an AM\(R communications system, which was \naccomplished at WRC 2007.    The FAA-Eurocontrol Future \nCommunications Study verified that the IEEE 802.16e \nstandard is appropriate for the AeroMACS system.  As this \nstandard supports the well-known WIMAX implementation, \nan aviation profile based on WIMAX has been developed by \nRTCA and EUROCAE, and the name AeroMACS has been \naccepted to refer to the emerging airport wireless ncommunications network.  Channel propagation \nmeasurements have been performed at several airports nproviding data for the development of channel models used \nfor simulations of the AeroMACS profile.  The availability \nin 2009 of IEEE 802.16e equipment tuned to the MLS \nExtension Band enabled the deployment of the first \nAeroMACS prototype as part of the NASA-CLE CNS \nTestbed located at the NASA Glenn Research Center and nadjacent Cleveland Hopkins International Airport. \nThis paper has focused on the results of testing of the nAeroMACS prototype from 2009 through 2012 at the \nNASA-CLE CNS Testbed, and has also provided the status \nof the AeroMACS standardization process. Testing of the \nmobile aspect of AeroMACS was performed first using a nground vehicle equipped with an AeroMACS mobile \nsubscriber station.  A second series of tests used a Boeing n737-700 equipped with an AeroMACS mobile subscriber \nstation and a C-Band aircraft antenna to repeat some of the \nground vehicle tests and also to demonstrate transmission of \na real weather application representative of safety critical \nservice application.  A third set of tests demonstrated the \ntransmission of high rate safety critical radar data over \nAeroMACS.  From these results, it can be concluded that \nthe performance of AeroMACS in supporting safety critical \naviation communications for both fixed and mobile \napplications will be sufficient to enable the deployment of \nAeroMACS.  The standards required to support future \ndeployments and ensure international compatibility are \nadvancing toward completion.  Although AeroMACS \ntesting and demonstration will continue while standards are \nfinalized, AeroMACS is poised for operational deployment \nin the near future. \nREFERENCES  \n[1] Haas, E., Lang, H., and Schnell, M. “Development and \nImplementation of an Advanced Airport Data Link Based \non Multi-Carrier Communications”, IEEE 7th \nInternational Symposium on Spread-Spectrum \nTechniques & Applications, September 2002. \n[2] United States of America, “Consider Additional \nAllocations for the Aeronautical Mobile \(R GHz”, ICAO \nAeronautical Mobile Communications Panel Working \nGroup F Meeting #10 Working Paper 11, August 2003. \n[3] Gheorghisor, I., Hoh, Y.S., and Box, F., “ \n5091-5150 MHz Bandsharing by Airport Wireless Local nArea Networks and Satellite Feeder Links”, 25th Digital \nAvionics Systems Conference, October 2006. \n[4 Wilson, J.

introduced SALSA, an approach to automatically\nanalyze Hadoop logs to construct state-machine views of the\nplatform’s execution [25]. The derived state-machines are used\nto trace the data-flow and control-flow executions. SALSA\ncomputes the histograms of the durations of each state and uses\nthese histograms to estimate the Probability Density Functions\n\(PDFs between the PDFs across machines to detect\nanomalies. Tan et al. also compare the duration of a state\nin a particular node with its past PDF to determine if the\nduration exceeds a determined threshold and can be flagged\nas an anomaly.\nAnother related work to this paper is the approach of Xu\net al. in [26], which uses the source code to understand the\nstructure of the logs. They create features based on the constant\nand variable parts of the log messages and apply the Principal\nComponent Analysis \(PCA behaviour.\nAll the above approaches are all designed for system\nadministrators in managing their large clusters. Our approach,\non the other hand, aims to assist developers in comparing the\ndeployed system on such large clusters against the develop-\nment cloud.\nX. CONCLUSION\nDevelopers of BDA Apps typically first develop their appli-\ncation with a small sample of data in a pseudo cloud, then\ndeploy the application in a large scale cloud environment.\nHowever, the larger data and more complex environments\nlead to unexpected executions of the underlying platform.\nSuch unexpected executions and their context cannot be easily\nuncovered by traditional approaches.\nIn this paper, we propose an approach to uncover the\ndifferent behaviour of the underlying platforms for BDA Apps\nbetween runs with small testing data and large real-life data\nin a cloud environment. To evaluate our approach, we perform\na case study on Hadoop, a widely used platform, with three\nBDA Apps. The case study results show the strength of our\napproach in two aspects:\n1 drastically reduces the verification effort\nby 86-97% when verifying the deployment of BDA\nApps in the cloud.\n2 the prob-\nlematic logs reported by our approach are much fewer\nthan using keyword search, which makes it possible to\nmanually explore the problematic logs.\nIn addition, our approach provides additional context informa-\ntion \(execution sequences sequences of the logs to\nrapidly understand the cause of problematic log lines.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
