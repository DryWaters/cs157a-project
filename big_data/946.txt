Data Mining Algorithms for Web Pre-Fetching Weifeng Zhang and Baowen Xu Llepartment of Computer Science and Engineering, Southeast University, China William Song Department of Information Technology, Hong Kong University, Hong Kong Hongji Yang Department of Computer Science, De Montfort University, England Kecheng Liu School of Computing, Staffordshire University, England Abstract To speed up fetching web pages this paper gives an intelligent technology of web pre-fetching We use a simplified WWW 
data model to represent the data in the cache of web browser to mine the association rules We store these rules in a knowledge base so as to predict the user\222s actions Intelligent agents are responsible for mining the users\222 interest and pre-fetching web pages based on the interest association repository In this way user browsing time has been reduced transparently Keywords WnrCt Internet Data Model Data Mining Pre-fetching Cache 1 Introduction With the r,apid development of 
Internet WWW is popular for i1:s multimedia transmission and friendly interactivity Although the speed of network has been improved considerably in recent years the rapid expansion of using the Internet the inherited character of delay in the network and the RequestJResponse working mode of WWW 12 still make the internet traffic very slow and give no guarantee on the Quality of Service QoS Because HTTP has no states the web server cannot know the users\222 demand and the users\222 requests cannot be predicted Taking advantage of a 
cache mechanism and the time locality of WWW access the browser can preserve the documents ever accessed in the local machine By this means for the documents in the local cache the browser does not need to send the requests to the remote server or to receive the whole response from he remote one. Pre-fetching uses the space locality of access First the users\222 access requests are predicted according to the users\222 current request. Second the expected pages are fetched into the local cache when the user is browsing 
the current page[ll Finally the users can access these pages downloaded from the local cache And thus this can reduce the access delay to some degrees. Pre-fetching is one kind of active caches that can cache the pages which are still not requested by the user The application of pre-fetching technology in the web can greatly reduce the waiting time after users have sent their requests Pre-fetching technology is based on prediction algorithms Data mining is a technique with which a lot of unknown implicit but potentially useful information such 
as knowledge rules and regularities for decision-making are mined Based on the historic data and the current data accessed by the user users activities in the future are predicted through data mining and relevant web pages are pre-fetched The data in the users\222 local cache can be taken as the data sources of data mining This paper concentrates on the above issues and discusses the application of data mining techniques in the pre-fetching of web pages. First a WWW data model is given 
Second we put forward an interest association repository and a predicting method And then an algorithm of transforming the simple WWW data model to the interest association repository is introduced Finally we present an agent-based web pre-fetching system 2 A Simple WWW Data Model The web pages are defined in HTML language By using MIME a web page can contain different types of elements A hyper media system l is made up of web pages linked by hyper links 
among each other To predict a user\222s activities a data model is needed to describe the interest association rules in the web pages Several data models 2 31 have described the WWW In order to meet the demand of data mining and represent the characteristic of the cache this paper proposes a simple WWW data model Some concepts and definitions of this model are presented below 34 0-7695-0577-5/00 10.00 0 2000 IEEE 


Definition 1 Let triple Id P time be a page node where each page node is associated with an Id time the latest time when the page node is accessed and P a collection of properties P  property p I i I 2  The property can be the relative URL the type the collection of linking nodes the container, the content the updated time, and so on According to whether the links exist and the pointing direction of the links in the web pages the page nodes can be classified into isolated page nodes source page nodes and target page nodes A page node which does not contain any links is the isolated page node A page node which contains links is called the source page node of such links While a page node which is pointed by some other links is called the target page node of such links Apparently according to different links one page node can be a source page node or a target page node of such links Definition 2 Let triple Id string target-node-id be a linking node where each Id identifies only one linking node string describes the presenting information of this linking node and target-node-id is the id of the target page node Definition 3 Let triple source-node L target-node be a link, where source-node is the source page node L is the linking node and target-node is the target page node L E collection of links in the source-node L.turget-node-id  target-node Figurel A simple WWW data model Figure 1 shows the proposed simple WWW data model In this model each node represents one web page these nodes are inter-linked by the links that clearly represent the association of these web pages The web browsers now use the cache technology which preserves the latest web pages accessed by the users When the users want to access these web pages again the browser first examines whether these web pages are cached locally If so the browser will then check whether the corresponding web pages are updated If updated these web pages can be achieved from the corresponding web servers Otherwise the pages are fetched from the local cache That is to say it is a passive mechanism in current browsers The historic data in the cache reflect the users\222 interest in browsing information and the associating information among the users\222 interest is useful to foresee the users\222 activities The associations among the web pages in the cache can be described easily in the simple WWW data model in Figure 1 But unfortunately, such a model can not visually represent the associating information of users\222 interests In order to predict users\222 activities and implement the active cache certain measures must be taken to transform the data in the cache from the simple WWW data model to another data model so that they become more suitable for predicting This approach will be introduced in the data mining section below 3 Interest Association Repository and User Action Prediction When a user is accessing a web page normally she or he will follow the links in the web page to access other web pages. Based on the current web page we can predict the links to be accessed by the user, and then can pre-fetch these web pages which will speed up browsing It is supposed that the browser can pre-fetch all the pages pointed by the links in the current web page It works better when there are only a few links that point to the different web servers But such method is not advisable The first reason is that it is generally not possible that the user accesses all the links in the web page Another reason is if the fee is charged by network stream the user may pay much more overhead Further more the streams of the Internet system should be balanced So in this paper we sort the links in the web page according to certain policy and pre-fetch a few web pages which are more possible to be accessed. Considering the response time of the system and the difficult level in the realization of the different systems we apply the simple association rules to predict the users\222 activities The interest association repository is made up of some interest association rules The interest set \(dictionary T is represented as  t  t2  t 1 where t  t2   t are lemmas. Here are more definitions Definition 4 The interest node is defined as a pair Node t   t  weight where t is the lemma in the interest set T and weight is the weight of t  Definition 5 The interest association rule is a triple Rule\(Node  t   t  Node  ts  weight Node  t  where weight is the probability from the interest node Node I  t linking to the interest node Node t  t  O weight 51 Definition 6 The interest association repository is a set of interest association rules where RULE  Rule Node  t  Node  t  I Rule\(Node t  Node f  is a rule is a 35

Therefore the fault of the data in pre-fetching period is avoided Users\222 browsing tracks are made up of the users\222 current accessing web pages If all the n previous pages must be processed when the user accesses the n+lth web page, the response time cannot be assured when n is big So an incremental algorithm which modifies the interest association repository every time works well when the user accesses one web page Algorithm 1 incremental algorithm of adjusting the interest association repository Assume that the user is accessing the nth web page Y  A few steps are taken as follows to mod:ify the interest association repository Step 1 Calculate the frequency of lemmas of T in the web page Y the slicing stemming and thesaurus technologies 6 are taken and a set K  Y    t fj  I t E T is obtained where f is the frequency of tl appearing in Y  fj O,iE N Each Node t in the interest association repository is adjusted as follows Step 2 if Node t  t  t and r;\222 f  E K Y  then No,de t   Node t   fj x F\(n where F\(n a monotonous and non-degressive function represents the freshness It is easily proved that the function F\(n ensures that the more recently the web pages are accessed the more favorable is to predict these web pages F\(n can be n n2 and so on During this process the weight of the node in the interest association repository increases gradually according to the user\222s accessing sequence so that the sequence of the user\222s accessing tracks has been embodied in the interest association repository We can use the following steps to predict the links that will be chosen by the user Algorithm 2 using the interest association repository to predict the user\222s activities Step 1 Use the Algorithm1 to process the current web page Step 2 Let L   I  1  I  be the all links that are in the current web page for each 1 in L do Slice the lemmas in the string in the I and get C I string  t I t is in 1 string jE N Step 3 Score all rhe links in L Value I  xNode\(i Rule\(Nodefk Node\(;.\222 J Q where Q  ti t,\222>l ti fk  K\(Y  and t E c I string RuIe\(Node ti  Node\(r,\222 E RULE Step 4 Sort Value 1 in descending sequence The more advanced the links are the more possibly the users access Select s foregoing links If s  k then let s  k Generally s is not more than 5 If the web pages pointed by such links do not exist in the local cache they will be pre-fetched The reliability is an important factor in pre-fetching technology From the Step 3 above we can get the reliability of link 1  c Nod4ti  RuI4 NodLjti  Nod4 222 1 Q 1  Nod4t  Q where Q    ti  ti  I  ti  fk  K Y  ti E c  I string Rule Node t  Node ti  E RULE Now we can get the reliability of the pre-fetching algorithm 36

An agent 5,9 IO based web pre-fetching system implementing the approach described in previous sections is shown in the Figure 2 In this system the Interest Association Repository the Mining Agent and the Decision Agent are attached to the Browser side The Interest Association Repository uses SQL Server7.0 to save the pre-fetching rules The Mining Agent and the Decision Agent are implemented by WIRPL 4 A mining agent runs at the client side and updates the interest association rules periodically the refresh rate can be set by users According to Algorithm 3 the data in the local cache represented by the simple WWW data model above are transforme:d into the interest association rules which are then stored in the Interest Association Repository The Decision Agent running at the client side can detect the user\222s activities in real time and can provide the abilities of predicting the user\222s activities online It should take charge of the tasks such as getting the current web page in the browser analyzing the current web page using Algorithm 2 interacting with the interest association repository pre-fetching the web pages and saving them into the local cache The interest association repository the mining agent and the decision agent are transparent to the users Therefore the users can use the browsers as usual Local Cache Browser E Mining Agent ecision Agent Interest A.ssociation Repository WWW Service I Figure 2 An agent based web pre-fetching system 6 Conclusion This paper first presents a simple WWW data model and then introduces some technologies with which the data in the cache of the browser can be mined the knowledge is saved into the interest association repository and the users\222 impending activities can be predicted Integrated with the data mining technique the agent technology and the web technology better quality of web service for the users is provided The design ideas of the agent based web pre-fetching reflect the development tendency of intelligent web browsers 7 References I Berners-Lee Tim et al, Hypertext Markup Language 2.0 Internet Network Working Group RFCl866 MIT/W3C 1995 ftp://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc 1866.txt 2 Leggett J et al 223Special issues on hypertext\224 Communications of ACM, 1994, 37\(2 pp 26-108 3 Chen Ying Xu Hongbin and Wang Nengbin 223Towards Globalization of Distributed Data Sources over WWW  Data Model and Query Language\224 Journal of Software 1998,9\(8 pp. 566-573 4 Zhang Weifeng and Xu Baowen 223Research on Framework Supporting Web Search Engine\224 Journal of Computer Research  Development 2000,37 5 Genesereth M R and Ketch S P 223Software Agents\224 Communication of the ACM 1994, 37\(7 pp 48-53  Zou Tao et al 223The Technology Implementation of Information Mining on WWW\224 Journal of Computer Research  Development 1999, 36\(8 pp 1021-1024 7 Zhang Weifeng Xu Baowen and Zhou Xiaoyu 223Counting Techniques in Web Pages\224 Mini-Micro Systems in preparation 8 Zhang Weifeng, Xu Baowen and Zhou Xiaoyu 223Web Page Techniques for Interacting between Elements\224 Computer Enginering in preparation 9 Robert Armstrong Dayne Freitag, Thorsten Joachims and Tom Mitchell 223Web-Watcher A Learning Apprentice for the World Wide Web\224 Proceedings of the AAAI Spring Symposium on Information Gathering from Heterogenous Distributed Resources Stanford CA March 1995  101 Marko Balabanovic and Yoav Shoham 223Learning Information Retrieval Agents Experiments with Automated Web Browsing\224, Proceedings of the AAAI Spring Symposium on Information Gathering from Heterogenous Distributed Resources Stanford CA March 1995  1 I Peter W Foltz and Susan T Dumais 223Personalized Information Delivery An Analysis of Information Filtering Methods\224 Communications of the ACM 35\( 12\pp 51-60 December 1992  121 Gudivada V N 223Informaiton Retrieval on the World Wide Web\224, IEEE Internet Computing 1997, 1\(5 pp 13]Chen M S et al 223Data Mining for Path Traversal Patterns in A Web Environment\224 Proceedings of the 16th International Conference of Distributed Computing System 1996 pp 385-392 58-68 38 


Furthermore we can also simplify both the DMC-base and DMC-bitmap algorithms since after 002nding the 002rst 1 on a column c j  there is no chance of adding any candidates into the candidate list cand  c j     1 10 100 1000 10000 100000 1000000 1 10 100 1000 10000 of 1's in a column of columns Web access log Page link Dic tionar y New s Web access lo g Page link News Dictionary Figure 4 Column density distribution Suppose that we want to extract 90 or more con\002dence rules In such a case a column that has fewer than 9 1's must have no miss Therefore if we can extract 100%con\002dence rules 002rst then we only consider those columns that have 10 or more 1's Fig 4 shows the distribution of the number of 1's in each column of four real data sets Since our data has many columns with few 1's this optimization improves the performance 4.4 DMC\255imp algorithm The 002nal algorithm to extract implication rules is following Algorithm 4.2  DMC-imp 1 Read M and count the number of 1's for each column ones  c i   Partition the data into buckets B i  i  0  d log 2 m e  according to the number of 1's for each row 2 Extract 100%-con\002dence rules by using the simpli\002ed DMC-base and DMC-bitmap algorithms Note we can skipStep1of DMC-base and we should scan the sparsest buckets 002rst In Phase 2 of DMC-bitmap we count the number of misses between c j and all c k that have at least one of rows r t r t 1 r n in common with c j  3 Remove columns c j such that ones  c j  024 1  1 000 minconf   4 Extract less-than-100%-con\002dence rules by using the DMC-base and DMC-bitmap algorithms Note that we can skip Step 1 of DMC-base and we should scan the sparsest buckets 002rst In our implementation we switch the algorithm from DMCbase to DMC-bitmap when the number of remaining rows becomes 64 or less and the memory size for the counter array that keeps both miss counters and candidate lists for each column exceeds 50MB Note that even if the memory size exceeds 50MB we do not switch the algorithm if the number of remaining rows is more than 64 regardless of the number of columns 5 Finding similarity rules We can 002nd similarity rules more ef\002ciently than we can implication rules since we can apply two more optimization techniques column-density pruning and maximum-hits pruning  5.1 Column\255density pruning If column c i and c j  such that j S i j\024j S j j have minsim or more similarity the ratio of the number of 1's j S i j  j S j j  must be minsim or more minsim 024 Sim  c i c j  j S i  S j j j S i  S j j 024 j S i j j S j j 024 1 Therefore we can save the memory space for miss counters for those column pairs c i and c j such that j S i j  j S j j  minsim  since we do not have to consider such pairs 5.2 Maximum\255hits pruning Similarity is affected by the number of misses of both c i against c j and c j against c i  while con\002dence depends only on the number of misses of c i against c j where j S i j\024j S j j  Therefore we can prune candidates earlier by considering the maximum number of hits as follows Example 5.1  Consider a matrix M as Fig 5 Since we do not count the number of misses between c i and c j such that j S i j  j S j j  we only maintain a miss counter from c 1 to c 2  If we want to extract 75%-or-more similar column pairs one miss is allowed between c 1 and c 2 At r 2 we initialize the miss counter for  c 1 c 2  to 0 Then at r 4 we check this candidate again 1 We should delete 1 Note that we could have deleted  c 1 c 2  at r 3 where c 2 has 1 but c 1 does not However in order to apply the maximum-hits pruning from a dense column c d to sparse columns c s from c 2 to c 1  in this example we have to check all candidate lists for sparse columns c s  which increases the computation time signi\002cantly Therefore we only apply the maximumhits pruning from a sparse column to dense columns

client IP address that have accessed the server recently An entry is set to 1 if there has been at least one hit for that URL from that particular client IP The data set Wlog  has more than 200,000 rows and 75,000 columns We also prepared the data set WlogP by pruning those columns with 10-or-fewer 1's The pruned data set WlogP has 13,000 columns 2 Web-page-link graph This data represents the URL link graph for the Stanford site which has about 700,000 pages Both columns and rows are the URL's An entry is set to 1 if there is a link from the page p i to the page p j  The rows are p i and the columns are p j in the data plinkF andtherowsare p j and the columns are p i in the data plinkT  Extracting similar columns from plinkF means extracting pages that are referred to by similar sets of pages while extracting from plinkT means extracting pages that have similar sets of links 3 News documents This data News  consists of 84,000 Reuters news documents Each row is a document and each column is a word Stop words  which appear among the documents very frequently are pruned before processing and 170,000 words remain By using implication rules with low-support pruning we can get sets of words each of which is related to a news topic To compare the performance with other algorithms we also prepare a smaller data set NewsP  since other algorithms could not be applied to our data sets in a reasonable execution time on our machine due to its memory size 4 Dictionary This is an on-line version of the 1913 Webster's dictionary that is available through the Gutenberg Project 15  C ol umns are head words words being de\002ned and rows are de\002nition words words used in the de\002nition There are 96,000 head words and 45,000 de\002nition words We can get similar de\002nition words such as brother-in-law and sisterin-law  by extracting similarity rules Table 1 Real data sets Data Rows Columns Wlog 218,518 74,957 WlogP 203,185 13,087 pliknF 173,338 697,824 plinkT 695,280 688,747 News 84,672 170,372 NewsP 16,392 9,518 dicD 45,418 96,540 6.2 Experimental results In this section we discuss our experimental results We use 6 sets of the data 226 Wlog  WlogP  linkF  linkT  News and dicD 226 for evaluating DMC-imp and DMC-sim Wealsouse one small data set NewsP for comparing the performance among the algorithms including a-priori and Min-hash  Fig 6 shows the experimental results The left graphs are for 002nding implication rules and the right graphs are for 002nding similarity rules Fig 6\(a and b plot the execution time with a different threshold Each execution can be 002nished in a reasonable time if we want to extract 85%-ormore rules The execution time decreases lineally according to increasing the threshold in general Fig 6\(c and d shows the details of the execution time for Wlog  The execution time for pre-scanning is small compared to other execution times The execution time for 002nding 100 rules is also small and constant for each threshold while the execution time for 002nding less than 100 rules depends on the threshold The execution times of DMC-imp and DMC-sim for plinkT have a gap between 80 and 75 threshold Fig 6\(e and f show the detail of the execution time In these cases the low-memory algorithm DMC-bitmap  jumps up from 22 to 398 seconds in the case of DMCimp and from 27 to 399 seconds in the case of DMC-sim  respectively The reason why this jump-up occurs is that larger rows that are handled in the DMC-bitmap includes many columns that have frequency 4 Since we can not prune columns with frequency 4 if the threshold is 75 or less the execution time for DMC-bitmap was dramatically increased If we could apply low-support pruning before executing algorithms it would not occur Fig 6\(g and h show the maximum memory size for the counter array that keeps candidate IDs and their misscounters DMC-sim requires much less memory than DMCimp since DMC-sim can use the two additional pruning techniques that we mentioned in Sec 5 Except DMCimp for News with 75%-or-less threshold all executions can 002t in main memory Since we apply the DMC-bitmap algorithms the memory requirement does not explode even as the threshold decreases For example the memory requirement for plinkT does not jump up even if the threshold decreases from 80 down to 70 while the execution time does In order to compare the DMC algorithms to a-priori and Min-Hash  we generated a pruned data set of news documents NewsP  We created this data from 16,392 news documents and pruned the columns with minimum support threshold 35 0.2 and maximum support threshold 3278 20 Since the number of remaining columns was 9518 the counters for all pairs could be 002t in main memory that required 172MB This situation is best for a-priori since

The execution time of the HPA program pass 2 is shown in figure 13 as the number of PCs is changed The maximum number of PCs used in this evaluation is 100 Reasonably good speedup is achieved in this application as the number of PCs is increased 5 Conclusion In this paper we presented performance evaluation of parallel database processing on an ATM connected 100 node PC cluster system The latest PCs enabled us to obtain over 110Mbps throughput in point-to-point communication on a 155Mbps ATM network even with the so-called 217\217heavy\220\220 TCP/IP This greatly helped in developing the system in a short period since we were absorbed in fixing many other problems Massively parallel computers now tend to be used in business applications as well as the conventional scientific computation Two major business applications decision support query processing and data mining were picked up and executed on the PC cluster The query processing environment was built using the results of our previous research the super database computer SDC project Performace evaluation results with a query of the standard TPC-D benchmark showed that our system achieved superior performance especially when transposed file organization was employed As for data mining we developed a parallel algorithm for mining association rules and implemented it on the PC cluster By utilizing aggregate memory of the system efficiently the system showed good speedup characteristics as the number of nodes increased The good price/performance ratio makes PC clusters very attractive and promising for parallel database processing applications All these facts support the effectiveness of the commodity PC based massively parallel database servers Acknowledgment This project is supported by NEDO New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization in Japan Hitachi Ltd technically helped us extensively for ATM related issues References  R Agrawal T Imielinski and A Swami Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases In Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data  pages 207--216 1993  R Agrawal and R Srikant Fast algorithms for mining association rules In Proceedings of International Conference on Very Large Data Bases  1994  A C Arpaci-Dusseau R H Arpaci-Dusseau D E Culler J M Hellerstein and D A Patterson High-performance sorting on Networks of Workstations In Proceedings of International Conference on Management of Data  pages 243--254 1997  D.S Batory On searching transposed files ACM TODS  4\(4 1979  P.A Boncz W Quak and M.L Kersten Monet and its geographical extensions A novel approach to high performance GIS processing In Proceedings of International Conference on Extending Database Technology  pages 147--166 1996 15 Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE SC97 Conference \(SC\22297 0-89791-985-8/97 $ 17.00 \251 1997 IEEE

US Coast Guard approved personal floatation devices must be supplied and inspected where employees are engaged in work where there is danger of drowning Required employee protection in public work areas to include the following  Warning signs or flags and other traffic control devices  Barricades for additional protection to employees  Barricades around excavated areas  Warning lights at night prominently displayed Lines or equipment which may be sub to backfeed from cogeneration or other sources are to be worked as energized in accordance with the applicable paragraphs of the Rules Comments w APPA submits the following comments regarding this Special Conditions section Recommends that the wording regarding capacitors be modified to include a waiting period for five minutes prior to short circuiting and grounding in accordance with industry standards for discharging of capacitors For series street light circuits, recommends that language be added for bridging to either install a bypass conductor or by placement of grounds so that work occurs between the grounds Recommends modification of the section regarding personal floatation devices to not apply to work sites near fountains decorative ponds swimming pools or other bodies of water on residential and commercial property Definitions x This section of the proposed Rules includes definitions of terms Definitions particularly pertinent to understanding the proposal and which have not previously been included are listed as follows Authorized Employee  an employee to whom the authority and responsibility to perform a specific assignment has been given by the employer who can demonstrate by experience or training the ability to recognize potentially hazardous energy and its potential impact on the work place conditions and who has the knowledge to implement adequate methods and means for the control and isolation of such energy CZearance for Work  Authorization to perform specified work or permission to enter a restricted area Clearance from Hazard  Separation from energized lines or equipment Comments x The following summarizes the changes in some of the definitions which APPA recommends Add to the definition for authorized employee It the authorized employee may be an employee assigned to perform the work or assigned to provide the energy control and isolation function  Recommends that OSHA modify the definition for a line clearance tree trimmer to add the word qualified resulting in the complete designation as a qualified line clearance tree trimmer Recommends that OSHA modify the definition of qualified employee" to remove the word construction from the definition since it is felt that knowledge of construction procedures is beyond the scope of the proposed rule resulting in APPA's new A2-18 I 


wording as follows more knowledgeable in operation and hazards associated with electric power generation transmission and/or distribution equipment Recommends that OSHA add a definition for the word practicable and replace the word feasible with practicable wherever it appears in the proposed regulations and that practicable be further defined as capable of being accomplished by reasonably available and economic means OTHER ISSUES Clothing OSHA requested comments on the advisability of adopting requirements regarding the clothing worn by electric utility industry employees EEI has presented comments which indicates research is underway prior to establishing a standard for clothing to be worn by electric utility employees However EEI's position is that this standard has not developed to the extent that it could be included in the OSHA Rules Both APPA and EEI state that they would support a requirement that employers train employees regarding the proper type of clothing to wear to minimize hazards when working in the vicinity of exposed energized facilities Grandfathering Due to the anticipated cost impact on the utility industry of the proposed Rules requiring that existing installations be brought to the requirements of the proposed Rules both APPA and EEI propose that the final Rules include an omnibus grandfather provision This provision would exempt those selected types of facilities from modification to meet the new rules EEI states that if the grandfathering concept is incorporated that electric utility employees will not be deprived of proper protection They propose that employers be required to provide employees with a level of protection equivalent to that which the standard would require in those instances in which the utility does not choose to modify existing facilities to comply with the final standard Rubber Sleeves OSHA requests comments from the industry on whether it would be advisable to require rubber insulating sleeves when gloves are used on lines or equipment energized at more than a given voltage EEI states its position that utilities should continue to have the option of choosing rubber gloves or gloves and sleeves to protect employees when it is necessary to work closer to energized lines than the distances specified in the clearance tables Preemuting State Laws EEI requests that the final Rules be clear in their preempting state rules applicable to the operation and maintenance work rules for electric power systems. This is especially critical since some states now have existing laws which are more stringent than the proposed OSHA Rules Examples are 1 in California and Pennsylvania where electric utility linemen are prohibited from using rubber gloves to work on lines and equipment energized at more than certain voltages and 2 in California and Connecticut where the live line bare hand method of working on high voltage transmission systems is prohibited One utility Pacific Gas  Electric has obtained a variance from the California OSHA to perform live line bare-hand transmission maintenance work on an experimental basis Coiiflicts Between the Rilles and Part 1926 Subpart V Since many of the work procedures in construction work and operation and maintenance work are similar and difficult to distinguish between EEI requests that the final order be clear in establishing which rule has jurisdiction over such similar work areas A2-19 v 


IMPACTS ON COSTS AND ASSOCIATED BENEFITS In its introduction to the proposed rules OSHA has provided an estimate of the annual cost impact on the electric utility industry for the proposed des of approximately 20.7 million OSHA estimates that compliance with this proposed standard would annually prevent between 24 and 28 fatalities and 2,175 injuries per year The utilities which have responded to this proposed standard through their respective associations have questioned the claims both of the magnitude of the cost involved and the benefit to the industry in preventing fatalities and lost-time injuries Both EEI and APPA feel that the annual cost which OSHA estimates are significantly lower than would be realized in practice Factors which APPA and EEI feel were not properly addressed include the following OSHA has not accurately accounted for cost of potential retroactive impacts including retrofitting and modifying existing installations and equipment OSHA has not consistently implemented performance based provisions in proposed rules  many portions require specific approaches which would require utilities to replace procedures already in place with new procedures Estimates were based on an average size investor-owned utility of 2,800 employees and an average rural cooperative of 56 employees, which are not applicable to many smaller systems such as municipal systems OSHA has not adequately addressed the retraining which would be necessary with modifying long-established industry practices to be in accordance with the OSHA rules EEI claims that OSHA's proposed clearance requirements would not allow the use of established maintenance techniques for maintaining high voltage transmission systems and thus would require new techniques For an example of the cost which is estimated to be experienced as a result of the new Rules one of the EEI member companies has estimated that approximately 20,000 transmission towers would need to be modified to accommodate the required step bolts in the Rules at an estimated cost of 6,200,000 Additionally this same company estimates that the annual cost of retesting live line tools for its estimated 1,000 tools would be 265,000 Additionally, both EEI and APPA question the additional benefits which OSHA claims would result from implementation of the new Rules APPA questions the estimates of preventing an additional 24 to 28 fatalities annually and 2,175 injuries per year in that it fails to account for the fact that the industry has already implemented in large part safety measures which are incorporated in the Rules EEI and APPA also point out that many preventable injuries cannot be eliminated despite work rules enforcement and safety awareness campaigns since many such accidents which result in fatalities are due to employee being trained but not following the employer's training and policies PRESENT STATUS OF RULES According to information received from the OSHA office in February 1993 the final Rules are to be published no later than July 1993 and possibly as soon as March 1993 OSHA closed their receipt of comments in March 1991 and no further changes in the rules are thought possible A2-20 


CONCLUSION The OSHA 1910.269 which proposes to cover electric utility operation and maintenance work rules affects a multitude of working procedures as are summarized in this paper It is not possible at the present time to assess the final structure of the Rules as may be proposed in 1993 or subsequent years Since the comments from the utility associations APPA and EEI were made following the initial release of the proposed OSHA Rules in 1989 a significant amount of time has elapsed where other events have occurred which may affect the form of the final Rules The 1993 NESC went into effect in August 1992 and includes some of the requirements to which the commenters objected For example a significant requirement in the Part 4 of the 1993 NESC requires that rubber gloves be utilized on exposed energized parts of facilities operating at 50 to 300 volts This requirement is in conflict with EEl\222s proposed change to the OSHA Rules which would still allow working such secondary facilities without the use of rubber gloves Electric utilities are advised to review the January 31 1989 proposed operation and maintenance Rules as summarized in this paper and to review their procedures which would be affected by application of the Rules Many of the procedures proposed in the Rules provide valuable guidance in electric utilities\222 operation and maintenance activities Where the cost impact is not significant, it is recommended that utilities consider implementing such procedures in expectation of the Rules being published in the next few months Also it would be appropriate for electric utilities to review the 1993 edition of the NESC since there are portions of the Rules which have resulted in changes in the NESC These changes mainly occur in Part 4 Rules for the Operation of Electric Supply and Communications Lines and Equipment The concerns which the commenters have addressed regarding the cost impact and the resulting benefits experienced as a result of the promulgation of the Rules are real ones and must be addressed in the final Rules As a result this paper cannot present a conclusion regarding the full impact of the Rules The development of such Rules continue to be an ongoing matter and will undoubtedly require later analysis when the final rules are published A2-21
