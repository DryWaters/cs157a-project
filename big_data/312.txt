INTRODUCTION \nWith the rapid development of Internet and Web services, \nmicroblogging has become a typical representation of social \nmedia and social network application. It can be defined as a \nform of blogging that let you write brief text updates, usually \nless than 200 characters, about our life on go and send them \nto friends and interested observers via text massaging, instant \nmessaging, email or the Web [1]. Twitter, Sina, Tencent, etc. \nare successful platforms of microblog, actually become a \npopular application in the real world and everyday life [2]. \nCorrespondingly the microblog services with user-\ngenerated contents have made a staggering amount of \navailable online information. For example, Twitter \ngenerated an estimated 55 million tweets a day in 2010 [3]. \nIt is straightforward that the massive microblog contents are \nrapidly increased, which can reflect the profile tendency, \nexpectation, emergency of people, social activities, and \nbusiness tendencies. Thus, the analysis and knowledge \ndiscovery of microblog and the corresponding social data \nhave been received more and more attention from \ngovernment, business, sociology, etc. For example, many \ncompanies adopt microblogging social media services as \nideal place to obtain timely opinions from customers and \npotential customers directly nFrom the perspective of academic research of \nmicroblogging and computational social networks [4], the \nlarge amount of real and relatively easily-obtained \nmicroblog data has established the basis for analyzing social nbehaviors or implied relationships among anticipating social \nentities. Naturally, the users with communications of \nmicroblog messages can be described as a network in a \nspecific domain. To achieve the similar groups of microblog \nusers in this network is useful for understanding the \nstructure or functionality of the microblog communities. \nGrouping microblog users is necessary from various \nperspectives in various abstraction hierarchies on the large \nmicroblog network with big social media data. In line with \nthe inherence of microblogging applications, the groups of \nmicroblog users are usually hierarchical and overlapping. \nThus, it is necessary to achieve such groups from the large \nmicroblog network with various granularities and \noverlapping users. \nIt is worth noting that the above problem is different \nfrom the classical clustering in data mining and machine \nlearning paradigm [5]. First, the grouping of microblog nusers is mainly determined by the behavioral interactions \nbetween users instead of their own attributes. As well, the \ntopological properties of the network will affect the \ndynamics in a very fundamental way Meanwhile, the above \nproblem is similar but not the same as the community \ndetection in complex or social network paradigm [6], since \nthe former focuses more on the groups of users than the \ninternal structural properties of the group components that \nthe latter focuses on. Therefore, it is desirable to explore a nmethod for grouping microblog users with hierarchical and \noverlapping properties while starting from their graphical \ntopology and their interactive relationships. This is exactly \nour purpose of this paper, and we call such grouping process \nas categorization.  \nIn recent years, various approaches for detecting \nmicroblog communities have been proposed from various \npoints of view in the fields of computer science or physics nFirst, by classification or clustering of microblog users by a \nsimilarity metric, Enoki et al. [7] gave the methods for \nclustering users by the “follow” relations between similar \nusers, and Coscia et al. [8] gave the clustering algorithm for \ndiscovering microblog communities. Second, by adopting \nthe graphical characteristics of microblog networks, Huang \net al. [9] gave the graph-based method for community \ndetection in online social networks. Particularly, we [10] \nproposed the method for community detection by a metric to nmeasure the closeness between users by considering both \n2013 IEEE International Congress on Big Data\n978-0-7695-5006-0/13 $26.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/BigData.Congress.2013.28\n149\nthe number and the strength of their associations. However, \nthe clusters or communities as a static microblog \ncommunity structure can be achieved by these methods, \nwhere the actual scale the microblog networks themselves \nand the 


corresponding computations upon them have not \nbeen well addressed as well.  \nGenerally from the perspective of complex networks, \nShen et al. [6] proposed an agglomerative hierarchical \nclustering algorithm EAGLE by focusing on the hierarchical \nand overlapping properties, which also hold and necessary \nfor microblog networks. EAGLE established a basis for our \nstudy on microblog user categorization, but the inherent ncharacteristics of microblogging should be incorporated, \nsuch as the actually large scale of the microblog network, \nand the different-strengthed interactions between users.  \nFurthermore, it is known that association classification \n[11] and associative clustering [12] algorithms from the \nperspective of behavior modeling were proposed by data \nmining and machine learning researchers. These algorithms \nprovides some basis for our categorization steps, but cannot \nbe directly applied in categorizing microblog users with \ninteractions in a large network. \nThus, by taking as input the microblog networks, we \nwill have to explore a flexible mechanism for the network \naccessing, especially for the relevant computations during \nmodeling and categorization. It is well known that \nmap/reduce is a programming model for processing and \nanalyzing large data sets over distributed storage [13]. It not \nonly offers a parallel programming model, but also can \nconduct and process massive data. Therefore, in our work, \nwe develop our algorithms based on map/reduce model to \nmake relevant computations possible oriented to large \nmicroblog networks in the real world. \nIn this paper, we first improved the modeling approach \nthat we proposed previously in [10] and made it suitable for \nlarge microblog networks with a large number of users \(i.e., \nnodes regarded as massive data source for categorization reflect \nthe follow relationships in realistic microblog services. Then, \nwe adopted map/reduce model to evaluate the similarity \nmetric between users by considering both the number and \nthe strength of their associations.  \nConsequently, we can transform the original directed \nnetwork into an undirected graph to describe the mutual \nrelationships between pairs of users, since it is unnecessary \nto differentiate the direction of the users’ associations when \nit comes to categorization of these users. Following, we \nproposed the map/reduce algorithm for bottom-up node \naggregation by adopting the concepts of chordal and join \ntree in the graph theory [14, 15], where “chordal” describes \nthe closeness among nodes in a graph [14], and the chordal \nsubgraphs constitute join trees [15]. Furthermore, a join tree \nis also chordal, which make the nodes in a join tree be able \nto be looked upon as those in the initial chordal subgraph \nfor repeatedly aggregation. Thus, we obtained the join trees \non the derived undirected graph model level by level in nbottom-up manner, corresponding to higher and higher \nabstraction hierarchies of microblog user categories nRepresentatively, we compare our method with the \nEAGLE algorithm [6] over general complex graphs from \nthe following aspects: \n Our method can also achieve the groups of users \nwith overlaps, naturally from the concepts of chordal \nand join tree themselves.  \n Our method makes full use of the linkages inherently \nin the large microblog network. \n Our method provides a universally systematic \napproach based on the graph model from user \nrelationship modeling to the ultimate hierarchical \ncategorization. \nFinally, we showed the feasibility of our method by \npreliminary experiments, including the efficiency and \nprecision on the benchmark microblog network. \nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In \nSection II, we give the architecture of our method, as the \nroadmap of later discussions. In Section III, we give the \ngraph model for describing the relationships among \nmicroblog users, as well as the corresponding computation \nmethod. In Section IV, we give the algorithm for \nhierarchical categorization of microblog users by \nincorporating the concept of chordal subgraph and join tree. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n nFigure 1.

In both parts, \nwe adopt map/reduce programming model for processing \nthe weights on the directed edges in the original directed \nnetwork and the chordal subgraphs respectively. In our \nmethod, we make full use of the parallizable characteristics \nof edges in the network and the components of the large \nscale microblog user 


categories. The algorithms for “Graph \nmodeling” and “Hierarchical categorization” will be \ndiscussed in Section III and Section IV respectively. \nIt is worth noting that the “Hierarchical categorization” \npart is executed once for each time of categorization \ncorresponding to a certain abstraction hierarchy. The formed njoin tree is still chordal, which will be discussed in Section \nIV, and this makes the obtained join tree can be regarded as \nthe MG with chordal subgraphs, as the MG at the first time \nof categorization. This means that a larger granularity of \ncategory will be obtained after each time of the \n“Hierarchical categorization execution. \nIII. GRAPH MODEL OF RELATIONSHIPS AMONG \nMICROBLOG USERS \nMicroblog has two special tweet types for \ncommunication among users, called replies and retweets. In \nthe network of microblog users, the edges correspond to \ndirect interactions of replies or retweets among users. A \n“reply” is a tweet sent in response to an earlier tweet and \nincludes the earlier tweet ID. All of the users following \neither the replying or the replied-to user can read this tweet. \nWhen a tweet is “retweeted” \(abbreviated as RT broadcast to the user’s followers. For an official RT with \ntwitter’s retweet command, the tweet is simply reposted \nwithout changing the original message. \nSuppose that user i calls user j for wij times and user j\ncalls user i for wji times in a microblog network. It is intuitive \nthat the more reciprocal and frequent of interaction between \na pair of users, the closer their relationship will be. Therefore, \nthe relationship strength can be simply defined as follows: \n *ij ij ijF R c Free   \nwhere Fij, Recij, Freij represent the relationship, reciprocity \nand frequency strength between i and j respectively. It is \nworth noting that Fij is computed by adopting the weights in \nthe directed microblog network directly. \nActually in the microblog applications, the information \non some nodes is always transmitted enormously by other \nnodes, but these nodes themselves transmit little on the \nothers. This appears frequently between the nodes ncorresponding to stars and their fans. Although the sum of \ninteraction is very high, stars and their fans are generally not \nvery close from each other. For example, given two different \npairs of weight \(wij to j and that \(wji 1, \n10 1, 1000 closer than the second.  \nTo make a distinction of the mutual relationship between \ni and j illustrated above determined by the number and \nstrength simultaneously, the increase of Freij should tend to \nflat with the increase of total interactions. So, the frequency \nstrength can be computed by *ij ij jiFre w w  and we have n *\nmin  generality, we can look upon the \nmicroblog users and the communicative interactions \(“reply”, \n“retweets between them as a vertex set and a weighted \ndirected edge set respectively, so the original microblog nnetwork can be represented as a directed weighted graph as \nshown in the Figure 1. \nAs stated previously, we will transform the original \ndirected graph model \(denoted as G0 of microblog users. By using Eq. \(2 be described by the results quantitatively. \nDefinition 1. A graph of mutual relationships of \nmicroblog users, called MG, is an undirected graph G=\(V,\nE nedges. For each e in E between user i and j in V \(1\bi, j\bn,\nij for strength \nbetween a pair of users in G. \nFollowing, we discuss the evaluation of Eq. \(2 microblog network G0 with large scale of users. In the \ndistributed storage system, each edge of the original directed \nmicroblog network G0 will be stored in a record respectively. \nBased on map/reduce programming model, the weight of \neach edge in G0 can be obtained in parallel. It can be \nobserved that Fij of between i and j can be obtained in \nparallel as well based on map/reduce programming model. In \nthe map process, the weight on each directed edge in the \ngraph will be obtained from the distributed storage system \nand the weights wij and wji between the same node pairs will \nbe outputted in a group as intermediate results. In the reduce \nprocess, the weights wij and wji between the same nodes in a \ngroup from the intermediate results will be used to compute \nFij, which will be outputted as the final result. As the result, \nthe MG can be stored as the same way of G0. The above \nideas are given in Algorithm 1.  \nAlgorithm 1.

i, j Figure 2. \nBy using Algorithm 1 on the original microblog network \nin Figure 2, we can obtain the MG shown in Figure 3. \nIV. HIERARCHICAL CATEGORIZATION OF MICROBLOG \nUSERS \nA. Hierarchical categorization algorithm \nTo categorize the nodes in the MG obtained in Section 2, \nwe can merge the subgraphs into an aggregation, if the ninterconnection among the nodes in the subgraph is close. \nThis bottom-up strategy starts by placing each subgraph in \nits own aggregation and then merges these initial \naggregations into larger and larger ones until the undirected \ngraph is in a single aggregation if possible or necessary. \nThus, the categorizations of microblog users can be obtained \nby means of the gradual aggregation of nodes in the MG. \nThis is the basic idea of our hierarchical categorization \nmethod that will be discussed in this section. \nInspired by the basic principle given in microblog \ncommunity detection [7, 8, 9, 10], microblog users \(i.e., \nnodes in MG aggregated if they are similar or \nassociated closely. To reflect the closeness property by \nmeans of graphical characteristics, we adopt the concept of \n“chordal” in the graph theory [14], defined as follows nDefinition 2. An undirected graph G=\(V, E chord, \ni.e., an edge joining two nonconsecutive nodes. \nFor example, the MG in Figure 2 is chordal according to \nDefinition 2, since length of each subgraph is less than four. \nHowever, if the MG G is not chordal, we can make it \nchordalized by repeatedly adding an edge between arbitrary \ntwo nodes in each time until every cycle of length four or \nmore has a chord. Thus, the nodes in each cycle of length \nthree or less form a chordal subgraph, denoted as Ci, which \ncontains the nodes closely associated and then generate an \ninitial category of microblog users. \nNaturally, we will have to obtain an order to achieve the \ncategories in higher abstraction hierarchies, by which the \nchordal subgraphs can be merged one by one. Let \(C1, …, Cm increasing order of chordal subgraphs of G, and with \nrespect to every Ci, 1\bj<i if the following holds for each j: \n \(C1  Ci1 1\bj<i C1, …, Cm subgraphs, that is, the closeness \nbetween Ci and Ci1 will be higher than that between Ci+1 \nand Ci1, since the sharing nodes between Ci and Ci1 are \nmore than those between Ci+1 and Ci1. Consequently from \nEq. \(3 for any two consecutive chordal subgraphs Ci and \nCi+1, naturally we have CiCi+1\f, which naturally reflects nthe overlap of two categories of microblog users. For the \nMG in Figure 2, \(C1, C2, C3 chordal \nsubgraphs, where C1=\(i, j, k j, p o, p, q a chordal \nsubgraph can be described as a tree, called join tree by \nadopting the corresponding concept in the graph theory [15], \ndefined as follows: \nDefinition 3. A join tree T is an undirected acyclic graph \nwith nodes corresponding to the subgraphs of G, such that \nfor every nodes v in G, if we remove all subgraphs not nj\ni\nk\no\np\nq\n7 \n60 \nj\ni\nk\n7 \n14 \n9 \n6 \n10 \n12 \n5 \no \np \nq \n9 \n10 \n8 \n5 \n7\n7\n5 \n152\ncontaining v from T then the remaining subtree stays \nconnected. \nFrom Definition 2 and Definition 3, we know that each \nnode in the join tree is composed of the microblog users that \nare closely associated. In the distributed storage system, each \nsubgraph in the maximum complete subgraphs \(S1, S2, …, Sm the map/reduce program, \neach subgraph will be changed to be chordal in parallel in the \nmap process. \(C1, C2 Cm 3 C1, C2, …, Cm nconnecting Cj to a predecessor Ck \(Ck{C1, …, Cj1 the \nhierarchical categorization by constructing join trees from a \nchordalized MG, given in Algorithm 2 nAlgorithm 2.

As an example Figure 3 shows a join \ntree T1 obtained by Algorithm 2 by the order \(C1, C2, C3 Figure 2. \nAs stated before, we are to obtain the categories with \nlarger and larger granularities by gradual bottom-up node \naggregation, where the higher the hierarchy, the larger the \ngranularity and the higher abstraction degree will be. It is not \nhard to see that the join tree obtained by Algorithm 2 is  \n \n \n \n \n \n n \nFigure 4. Join tree corresponding to the MG in Figure 2. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 5.

This means that we can also \nmerge the nodes in a join tree, as those in an initial MG, to \ngenerate the chordal subgraphs and then new join trees of \nhigher abstraction degrees. Algorithm 2 can be executed \nrepeatedly until only one node remains. For the join tree T1 nin Figure 4, we can achieve the order \(C1, C2 3 C1, C2 C2, C3 again by \nAlgorithm 2, the new join tree T2 with higher-granularity \ncategories of microblog users can be obtained and shown in \nFigure 5. \nB. Case study: adaptive node aggregation \nTheoretically for the bottom-up node aggregation, the \nexecution of Algorithm 2 can be stopped until only one node \nremains, which hold in general cases of complex networks \n[6]. However, it will not make sense if we know all \nmicroblog users just belong one category. Meanwhile, there \nis no fixed condition for all hierarchies to determine the nappropriateness of the category granularities, and the number \nand size of categories are unknown in advance In this \nsection, we discuss how to make the process of node \naggregation stopped when the categories have been already \ngood enough, which we call adaptive node aggregation. As \nthe case study, this strategy can be regarded as the \noptimization or improvement of the hierarchical \ncategorization centered on Algorithm 2. \nBy extending the modularity measurement of community \nquality [16], Shen et al. [6] proposed a quality measure of ncommunities in a complex network concerning the \nhierarchical and overlapping properties. A high value of the nquality metric indicates a significant community with \noverlapping structure. If we represent the MG by an nadjacency matrix composed of Aij=1 \(or 0 or not metric of a \npartition of the MG, denoted as Q, can be written as: \n 1 1  j\nij i j\nij i j\nk k\nQ A C Cm O O m  \n\nwhere 1\n2 ijij\nm A  is the total number of edges in the MG; \nki is the degree of node i; Ci  represents the category that \nnode i belongs to, in which \(Ci, Cj if and only if Ci=Cj; \nOi is the number of categories including node i.  \nTherefore, Q can be adopted to determine whether the \naggregation should be made further if Q\t, where  is a \ngiven threshold of the quality of current partition of the MG. \nBy incorporating Q into the bottom-up aggregation of nodes, \neither for those of initial users or those of chordal subgraphs, \nthe node aggregation can stopped adaptively according to the ncharacteristics of the currently achieved categories. Note that \nthe computation of Eq. \(4 efficiently fulfilled in \nparallel upon the distributed storage of the large scale of MG. \nT2 \nC2 C1\nC1\nC2\nT1 \nC3\n153\nV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS \nTo evaluate the feasibility of the proposed method in this npaper, we made experiments on the efficiency of MG \nconstruction from the original microblog network and the ncorresponding hierarchical categorization, as well as the \neffectiveness of the categorization results. Our experiment \nplatform includes four machines, where one is master node \nand the others are slave nodes. The CPU of each machine is \nPentium\(R the versions of \nHadoop [17], Linux and Java are 0.20.2, Ubuntu 10.04, and \nJDK 1.6 respectively. We adopted the benchmark computer-\ngenerated networks \(denoted as FLR  networks have a heterogeneous \ndistribution of node degree, edge weight and community size, \nwhich are exactly the features of real microblog networks.  \nFirst, we tested the efficiency of our method by recording \nthe total execution times \(time of initialization of Hadoop, \nI/O, and algorithm execution from the \noriginal microblog network and the gradual aggregation until \nthe only one node remains in the join tree. This experiment \nwas made on the cluster with 1, 2, and 3 slave nodes \nrespectively with the increase of users \(nodes in the network total execution time is not sensitive to the \nincrease of microblog users for every number of slave nodes nMeanwhile, the total execution time is decreased with the \nincrease of slave nodes. Thus, the hierarchical categorization \ncan be fulfilled efficiently to a certain extent. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 6 Total execution time. \nSecond, we further tested the efficiency of our algorithm \nby comparing the total execution time \(demoted TET denoted as AET initialization and I/O.

therefore be considered \nto be the optimal number for the computations. The relatively \nhigh CK time for the NFS case shows the poor performance of \nNFS for this application, which has an overhead of 701 \nminutes over the S3 case.  \nThe Cumulative job time is the sum of all the job runtimes \nas seen by HTCondor \(the workflow job scheduler jobs read in input data from the \nshared filesystem and write out to the shared filesystem. \nHowever, jobs are more complex in the S3 case. They are \nmade up of not only the Kickstart wrapped tasks, but also \nPegasus Lite steps such as data transfers to/from S3. The \nruntime of the job seen by HTCondor on the submit host is \nthus the sum of kickstart time and the time for Pegasus Lite \ndata transfers for the job. Therefore, the overhead of the S3 \ncase is the difference between the Cumulative job time and the \nCumulative Kickstart time, which is 976 minutes. Even though \nthese overheads only differ by 39%, the overall wall times, 70 \nand 129 minutes show an increase of 84%. The reason for this \ndifference is the structure and the distribution of the runtimes nof the Montage workflow. Data access patterns, and the effect \nof data staging, are different for the different transformations \nin the workflow. The second half of the workflow is where the \nre-projected background corrected, and scaled images are \nmosaicked together, and many of these jobs operate on a large nnumber of inputs. Any increase in data access times in this \npart of the workflow can significantly increase the overall \nworkflow wall time. For example, due to the large number of \ninputs, the mAdd job, which is on the critical path of the \nworkflow, took 3 times as long in the S3 case as in the NFS \ncase. \nFor the CPU-intensive workflow experiment we choose a \nRosetta [30] workflow. Rosetta is a macromolecular structure nmodeling code. Our experiments used a Rosetta workflow that \ncontains 200 protein-folding simulations. The tasks in this \nworkflow are CPU-intensive, have no data dependencies \nbetween tasks, and all require the same reference database \nmade up of 477 files. Because Rosetta is CPU intensive and \njust a small amount of I/O is taking place, we expected the \nruntimes to be about the same regardless of data staging \napproach. The run times for the Rosetta workflow can be \nfound in Table 2, which shows that the S3 wall times are \nsignificantly longer than the NFS times. The explanation for \nthe slowdown in the S3 case is the reference database and the n NFS -sharedfs \(minutes minutes nCumulative \nJob time 2936 4557 \nTable 2. Average run times for Rosetta workflow.  \n NFS – sharedfs \(minutes nS3 - nonsharedfs \n\(minutes 1196 \nTable 1. Average run times for the Montage workflow \n33\ndata access pattern. Size wise, the database is a relatively \nsmall 391 MB, but it is split into 477 separate files. If the \ndatabase were contained in one file, it could be quickly \ntransferred to/from S3. However, because it is split, the \nworkflow needs to issue a separate get operation to fetch each \npiece of the database from S3, which adds a significant \namount of overhead to the workflow \(both in the walltime and \nthe cumulative job time – which includes the S3 data transfers \nto the local filesystem workflow in the S3 case \nwithout task clustering when compared to NFS.  \nIn contrast to the Montage experiment, where the large \nfiles and continuous I/O strained the NFS server, the light data \naccess pattern of Rosetta, and the fact that the same files are \nread over and over again, which increases OS level file system \ncaching, makes the Rosetta workflow work very well with \nNFS as can be seen from the similar Cumulative Kickstart \ntimes for Rosetta. \nVII. RELATED WORK  \nThere are many approaches, some similar and some noutside the scope of this paper, for a workflow management \nsystem to handle data. Swift [31] is using a model similar to \nwhat is described above in using a shared or local file system \nat a site as cache, and with the submit host acting as the data \nstaging site. The system first selects a compute site to run a \njob, and then pushes the data from the submit host to a file \nsystem at the site. The job is run, and outputs are staged back \nthe submit host. Intermediate files can be left on the shared file \nsystem for subsequent jobs Our approach is more flexible as \nthe data sites \(input, output, and intermediate submit host, and use a variety of different protocols. \nOther workflow systems like Kepler [32], Triana [33 and \nTaverna [34] focus on streaming workflows or workflows that \nconsist of components that call out to other web services. They \nhave graphical user interfaces that allow users to compose \nworkflows composed of different components and are \nnormally not used to execute workflows that access large \ndatasets. However both rely on the user to specify data \nmanagement steps in the workflow, providing limited data \nmanagement automation. \nKepler [35] introduced a MapReduce actor that allows it to \nexecute composite workflows where some tasks use the Map \nReduce [36] paradigm. Hadoop [37] is often used for running \ndata intensive applications, and it does provides a somewhat \nPOSIX-like file system, allowing random reads, but only non-\nrandom writes. However, in this case the Hadoop \ninfrastructure is responsible for the partitioning and ndistributing the input data to the individual nodes. Our \napproach deals with workflows that need to run on a 


variety of \ndifferent execution environments, with codes that are not \nMapReduce. \n On XSEDE, distributed file system like GPFS-WAN [38] \nhas been available for the jobs to access data. Distributed file \nsystems do provide POSIX access to remote input and output \nfiles. However, our experience with large datasets on XSEDE nindicates that it is better to stage the large datasets to the local \nparallel file system of the XSEDE cluster and let the jobs \naccess the datasets from there. Chirp [39] is another global \ndistributed file system that has been proposed for grid \nenvironments. To access files a Chirp server needs to be \nlaunched on the input storage servers and the jobs then can \naccess the input data when launched via Parrot [40] that traps \nIO system calls and redirects to the Chirp Server.  A chirp \ndeployment can be incorporated in our model, where Pegasus \nLite can launch the job-using Parrot. \nThis paper has been mainly focused on flexibility of where \ndata is placed and computations are placed. Much research has \nbeen done in focused strategies and optimized data placement \nin specific environments. Raicu et al [41] have explored use of \na data diffusion approach where the data resides on a GPFS \npersistent storage. They employ various caching strategies at \nthe executor nodes provisioned by Falkon [42] to provide \nbetter performance than the shared file system approach based \non data locality of the workloads. Chervenak et al. [43] have \ninvestigated data placement for scientific workflows running \nunder Pegasus by measuring the influence of data pre-staging. \nAlspaugh [44 used an open source rule engine called Drools \nto integrate with GridFTP and Globus RLS [45] for processing ninput data for workflows.  \nVIII. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK  \nIn this paper we have described how workflow nmanagement systems can use object stores to execute large, \ndata-intensive workflows used in Big Data problems. We have \ndescribed two general approaches: one that exclusively uses \nobject stores to store all the files accessed and generated \nduring a workflow, and another that relies on the shared file \nsystem for caching the intermediate data sets. The data \nmanagement challenge for the workflow system is to support \nboth of these configurations and provide scientists the \nflexibility of using either approach. We then described the \nimplementation of both approaches in the Pegasus Workflow \nManagement System. Our solution involves decoupling the \nintermediate data storage site \(the data staging site an autonomous component \ncalled Pegasus Lite that is able to retrieve datasets when a job \nstarts on a remote worker node. We have implemented this \nsolution in Pegasus version 4 and it is now used in production \nto execute workflows in a variety of execution environments, \nranging from traditional supercomputing environments with a \nshared file system to dynamic environments like the Open \nScience Grid that only offer remote object stores to store large \ndatasets. \nPegasus Lite currently retrieves the input data for the job nfrom a remote object store. However, the input data can be \nlocally available on the compute nodes. This scenario is \ncommon when workflows are executed on dedicated \napplication-specific compute infrastructure such as the LIGO \nData Grid [46], where the data is actively replicated out of \nband on the various grid sites. We plan to introduce pluggable \nlocal discovery capabilities to Pegasus Lite that will allow it to \ndiscover files locally on the node before retrieving them from \na remote object store. Having the flexibility of data and \n34\ncomputation placement opens up the ability to study a variety \nof workflow scheduling and data placement algorithms. We \nplan to conduct more research in that direction. \nIX.

Conclusions The SHOTPUT mission , its unique trajectory and potential encounter with six different small bodies will provide a novel view of the composition of the solar system. The science return from the mission will help answer questions on formation, composition and evolution of small bodies in our local neighborhood In addition, the team has proposed a mission that is within budget based on heritage instruments satisfying the decadal survey requirements.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
