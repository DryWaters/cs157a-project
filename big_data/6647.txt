OLFAR project is one of these applications and aims to develop a low-frequency radio telescope for the 0.3 MHz to 30 MHz band It uses a swarm of 50 or more identical nano-satellites to synthesize a very large aperture to explore the ultra-long electromagnetic EM waves in this frequency band The swarm will act similar to a wireless sensor network WSN that samples the cosmic noise processes the data in a distributed manner and then sends the data to a base station BS for further processing and analysis The satellites will have a very simple architecture characteristic of a WSN node that will focus on three main functionalities radio observation data processing and distribution inter-satellite and downlink However the complexity of the application results in strict requirements for the design 
of the satellites components especially for the antenna systems Starting from OLFARês requirements and limitations three separate antenna systems for scientiìc observation inter-satellite link ISL and data downlink are designed and integrated into a nano-satellite platform T ABLE OF C ONTENTS 1I NTRODUCTION  1 2T HE NANO SATELLITE IMPLEMENTATION  2 3O BSERVATION ANTENNAS  3 4I NTER

attracted numerous resources as they opened a new path in understanding and broadening our knowledge of the Universe The radio observation of the cosmic background radiation came as an aid for optical telescopes It offered new insights over already known celestial bodies and phenomena  978-1-4799-1622-1/14 31  00 c  2014 IEEE 1 IEEEAC Paper 2120 Version 2 Updated January 10 2014 and also revealed new ones The potential of exploring new scientiìc drivers enhanced the development of radio telescopes all across the world Both Earthand space-based instruments were built or are currently under construction to capture electromagnetic electromagnetic EM waves of 
cosmic origin At ground level very large dish telescopes e.g The Arecibo Observatory and arrays LOFAR Square Kilometre Array were b uilt or are currently under construction to observe EM waves with frequencies as low as 30 MHz Furthermore spacecraft such as the Herschel Space Observatory and Planck were launched into space to image the Universe in far infrared and submillimeter wavebands and respectively infrared and microwave bands One of the last unexplored frequency bands is the 0Ö30 MHz band Observing the ultra-long-wavelength EM waves in the previously mentioned frequency band is particularly interesting for revealing details about exo-planets and for a better understanding of the evolution of the Universe However until now the required instrument proved to be too 
complex for our technological possibilities Building a radio telescope to explore the Universe in the very low frequency domain needs to overcome a few limitations First of all an Earth-based instrument is not possible due to ionospheric properties The EM waves of interest are strongly affected by scintillation or cannot even penetrate the ionosphere for frequencies below 15 MHz Added to this the large amount of man-made radio interference make it impossible to distinguish the ultra-long EM waves originating from cosmic sources at ground level Secondly  i t i s v ery challenging to build a space-based solution as well due to the required size of the instrument Ultra-long waves can only be observed with an aperture in the order of kilometers that cannot be implemented in a monolithic fashion and certainly not integrated in a single spacecraft 
Recent developments in space industry have motivated engineers and scientists to reconsider the idea of a low-frequency radio telescope in space The evolution and ongoing miniaturization of technology have led to the emergence of new very small spacecraft nano-satellites capable of performing simple missions in outer space With this the concept of distributed satellite systems became feasible and more complex tasks were thought of such as weather monitoring and radio astronomy In the Distributed Aperture Array for Radio Astronomy In Space DARIS project a study about the possibility of doing low-frequency observations with multiple small satellites 1 


was conducted A scenario with eight slave spacecraft and a central spacecraft was proposed in which the nodes will do the sensing part while the mothership will have additional processing and communication tasks One of the conclusions of the study was that technology has reached a level where this type of scenario is realistic and can be implemented with commercial off-the-shelf COTS components However having a central spacecraft increases the risk of failure of the system In a similar manner the Orbiting Low Frequency Antennas for Radio Astronomy OLFAR project aims to develop a radio telescope in space for the 0Ö30 MHz domain by employing a completely distributed system A swarm of 50 or more nanosatellites orbiting faraway from terrestrial radio-frequency interference RFI will be used to sense and sample the cosmic noise process the information by means of distributed correlation and send the processed data to a base station BS on Earth see Figure 1 Thus each member of the swarm will have to fulìll three main tasksÑradio observation data distribution and processing and downlinking From the hardware point of view separate subsystems will have to be designed and integrated on a miniaturized spacecraft platform Multiple antenna systems will have to be hosted by the nano-satellites to be able to support the data ow into within and out of the swarm Figure 1  OLFAR swarm on a lunar orbit In this paper we summarize previous work on the intersatellite link ISL and radio observation antenna systems and extend it with the design considerations of the downlink antennas We propose a simple radio architecture for the satellites and discuss a cubesat implementation of the OLFAR swarm in Section 2 In Sections 3 4 and 5 we follow through with the design of the three separate antenna systems for the three data-related tasks Conclusions are drawn in Section 6 2 T HE NANO SATELLITE IMPLEMENTATION Several aspects confer OLFAR an unique approach and make the project distinguish itself from previous studies Unlike the DARIS project the system proposed by OLFAR will be completely distributed The satellite swarm will comprise of a large number 50 or more of identical spacecraft Although the assigned functionalities may differ from member to member e.g communication master no dif ference will be made from the hardware perspective This increases the robustness and reliability of the sw arm and will also enhance the processing of the radio astronomy data In Figure 1 a possible deployment location for the OLFAR swarm is exempliìed and the different tasks are illustrated In this case the advantages and the constraints of a lunar orbit result in a temporal separation of the tasks One orbital period can be divided into three optionally four stages 1 Observation  in the radio-silent region satellites will only sample the cosmic background radiation 2 Data distribution and processing  once sampled the data is shared among all the members of the swarm and processed by means of distributed correlation 3 Downlink  while facing Earth satellites will send the processed data to a BS on Earth 4 The fourth stage is optional If it is necessary this stage can be used to nalize the distribution and processing task or it can be an idling stage when the only task is the solar power conversion Another key feature of OLFAR is the engineering mindset The project is aimed at developing an instrument and all the necessary hardware rather than only analyzing its feasibility A new satellite platform was recently developedÑthe cubesat platformÑand was proven to be eligible for space applications The many successful launches sho wed that the platform is suitable for more complex missions than technology demonstrations Therefore OLFAR is planning to use three-unit 3U cubesats similar to Delì-C3 to fulìll its science task The satellites will have a very simple and robust architecture as shown in Figure 2 The three main subsystems will exchange information and inter-operate while having support from other secondary subsystems  electric power system EPS propulsion attitude control  Figure 2  Functional diagram of a small satellite The simple radio architecture has to be backed up by suitable hardware antennas custom built to t the cubesat platform Since the main tasks are fundamentally different separate antenna systems will be placed on the 3U cubesat and used for capturing low-frequency cosmic waves distributing data between the members of the swarm and sending the result of the processing to a BS on Earth Accommodating multiple antenna systems on a simple nanosatellite platform is very challenging because of the limited 2 


volume area and mass The cubesat standard limits the mass of a 3U cubesat to 4  000 grams and speciìes a parallelepipedic shape of 30 cm  10 cm  10 cm thus limiting the size of possible patch or wire antennas Due to launch restrictions such as the size of the standardized cubesat orbital deployer long wire antennas must be housed inside the satellite during launch and only be deployed once the satellites have reached orbit Furthermore deployment mechanisms should be kept simple or even avoided as much as possible to preserve the robustness and reliability of the system Taking these limitations into account in the next sections we proceed to the design of three antenna systems one for each of the main functionalities of the OLFAR satellites 3 O BSERVATION ANTENNAS Challenges and requirements To operate over the multi-octave band of 0.3 MHz to 30 MHz it is necessary to have an observation antenna with dimensions in the order of meters to hundreds of meters This cannot be realized in the form of patch antennas or aperture antennas mounted on the exterior of the satellite due to the satellite dimensions Reîector antennas are excluded due to the complex deployment mechanism required for such a conìguration The only available option is wire antennas mounted on the exterior of the satellite connected as either monopoles or dipoles Furthermore these antennas are required to have good sensitivity in as large a eld of view FoV as possible in order to sample the full 4  steradian range Also three orthogonal antennas are required in order to extract the amplitude phase and orientation of the incoming EM waves Design and implementation Dipoles much shorter than a wavelength have favorable antenna pattern shapes with 3 dB beam widths of 90  However they are inefìcient Increasing the length to the order of a wavelength improves the efìciency while maintaining decent antenna pattern shapes with 3 dB beam widths of 75   Above one wavelength the antenna patterns start to lose their shape through becoming dominated by side lobes thereby constraining the dipole lengths to one wavelength This restricts the dipoles to 10 meters this being a full wavelength at the highest frequency in the operational band of 30 MHz Ho we v e r  this is the theoretical limit for an inìnitesimally thin dipole while for a physical antenna depending on the wire radius side lobes will start to appear at frequencies below 30 MHz Therefore the dipoles are chosen to be 9  6 meters to shift the theoretical full wavelength resonance to 31 MHz and hence shift side lobes outside of the operational band For optimal performance the corresponding monopole pairs for each dipole should be deployed opposite to each other sharing two planes with the minimal feed gap size possible separating them Also the three dipole pairs should be orthogonal to each other sharing the same geometric center However due to mechanical constraints this is not possible The cramped conìnes within the satellite prohibit an electric connection for one of the dipole pairs Instead this pair must be electronically coupled resulting in a pair of pseudo-antipodal monopoles mounted on a nite ground plane Also due to the deployment mechanism each dipole pair has a different geometric center In addition to this due to the varying port impedance over the wide operational band the astronomical antennas are used as active antennas where an active antenna does not remove energy from the eld being measured but instead acts as an electric eld probe The resulting astronomical antenna is composed of six wire antennas deployed in three orthogonal directions as depicted in Figure 3 Antennas are internally housed during launch To minimize the volume taken up by the payload within the satellite the antennas are deployed in groups of three at either end of the satellite Antipodal pairs C  D and E  F are electrically coupled and pseudo antipodal pair A  B is electronically coupled to form dipole pairs              Figure 3  Nano-satellite exterior The solid back and gray lines are used to sketch the nano-satellite and the solar panels respectively the dashed lines represent the wire antennas and the arrows are used for dimensioning The exterior of the satellites is also used to mount the twin deployed solar panel arrays the surf ace-mounted patch antennas for inter-satellite communication and Earth downlink the integrated propulsion system and the surfacemounted astronomical source sensors The monopoles are lengths of copper wire enclosed by radiofrequency RF structures with a triangular rollable and collapsible TRAC cross section as depicted in Figure 4 to keep the antennas rigid The diameter of the copper wire is 0  24 mm which is twice the skin depth of copper at the lowest frequency of the operational band of 300 kHz This diameter ensures that the antenna loss resistance is at a minimum while keeping the antennas as thin and as light as possible Simulations On each satellite the observation antenna system consists of three orthogonal dipoles designed to work within the constraints of a nano-satellite Due to mechanical constraints the dipoles are not optimally integrated into the nano-satellites from an antenna point of view Therefore the effects of the nite non-uniform ground plane the non-symmetrical antenna deployment and the non-inìnitesimal dipole gap on the antenna properties need to be investigated Using WIPL-D a model of the e xterior of a satellite 3 


w  w t Figure 4  Antenna cross section with solar panels and astronomical antennas is simulated to derive multiple properties of the astronomical antenna In simulating the passive port impedances the feed lines can be designed and the resonance frequencies of the monopoles can be determined In exciting the monopole under test its radiation efìciency can be simulated Also the electromagnetic port parameters of each monopole are simulated to derive the antenna patterns The resonance frequencies of the monopoles are determined by simulating the reactance of the monopoles From the simulations the monopoles have three resonance frequencies of interest as depicted in Figure 5 The rst around 16 MHz is equal to the half-wave resonance The second around 29 MHz and the third around 33 MHz are at either side of the full-wave resonance The offsets in the resonances can be attributed to the nite and non uniform ground plane 4 10 1 10 0 10 2 10 35 Frequency [MHz 25 10 15 Reactance  0 3 10 20 2 1 Operational Band 30 5 Figure 5  Reactance as a function of frequency The radiation efìciency of the monopoles is determined by subtracting the resistance of the ideal monopoles from their realized versions thereby removing the conduction loss resistance and the dielectric loss resistance from the radiation resistance From the simulations the monopoles have low radiation efìciencies in the low end of the operational band with nearly perfect radiation efìciencies above the half-wave resonance as depicted in Figure 6 100 20 0 60 40 Efficiency 80 Frequenc y M 10 15 0 2 5 Figure 6  Radiation efìciency as a function of frequency From the simulated results of Figure 6 it is evident that a monopole as long as possible is desired as this would result in a higher radiation efìciency and in turn higher gain in the lower half of the operational band However from the simulated results of Figure 5 it is evident that this would shift the antenna pattern at longer wavelengths within the operational band with the desire to not exceed a wavelength to avoid side lobe domination in the antenna pattern The antenna pattern above the third resonance of 33 MHz is simulated as depicted in Figure 7 The antenna pattern for each monopole consists of multiple lobes of various gain as depicted in Figure 7a The desired antenna pattern of a single beam cannot be recovered by forming dipole pairs as depicted in Figure 7b However the desired single beam is still present at frequencies around 35 MHz thereby limiting the dipole lengths to about one wavelength  0.2 0.6  1 30  210  60  240  90  270  120  300  150  330  180  0  a Monopole C  0.2 0.6  1 30  210  60  240  90  270  120  300  150  330  180  0   b Dipole CÖD Figure 7  Antenna Pattern at 45 MHz The antenna pattern around the third resonance of 33 MHz is simulated as depicted in Figure 8 The antenna pattern for each monopole consists of multiple lobes of various gain as depicted in Figure 8a The desired antenna pattern of a single beam is recovered for each pair by forming dipole pairs as depicted in Figure 8b Therefore forming dipole pairs is 4

In order to meet the gain requirement and ensure that the system functions properly a beamforming approach is used to control the antennas Maximum directivity is achieved for any link direction by assigning different weights to the contributing antennas  X  Y and Z  The complex weight for each individual antenna i where i can be X  Y or Z s calculated as w i    c i e j i  1 where c i  D i   i

referred to the global coordinate system as shown in Figure 11a   i  i  the link direction referred to its local coordinate system as shown in Figure 11b D i   i  i  is the normalized directivity expressed in the local coordinate system d i is the distance from the antenna system coordinates origin to the other satellite and k is the wave number Another very important and inîuential aspect of the ISL is the choice of the individual antenna The performance of the link between the satellites strongly depends on the characteristics of the antennas Properties such as gain bandwidth radiation pattern and polarization are key elements for a good implementation A circularly polarized patch with a resonance frequency of 2.45 GHz was initially selected so that it ts the cubesatês facets and meets the 5 dBi gain and the 90  half-power beamwidth requisites Nonetheless the limited bandwidth and the unsatisfying axial ratio might need an improved solution Simulations and measurements The ISL antenna system will consist of six circularly polarized patches placed one on each facet of the 3U cubesat and an antenna system controller that will maximize the directivity in the desired direction of transmission or reception An analytical model was developed to evaluate the performance of the system Figure 12 consists of the resulted radiation pattern for an arbitrarily selected link direction   d  d  of 58  1   38  3   and the radiation pattern of an antenna selection scheme It can be observed that the beamforming provides a gain increase for the proposed link direction The peak gain of the considered antenna system was calculated also for other link directions and the results are plotted in Figure 13\(a The graph proves that our solution meets the 5-dBi requirement for any direction of the ISL Furthermore an evaluation platform with COTS components was built to test the antenna system It consisted of a transmitting antenna and a two antennas for reception placed on a cubesat platform on the perpendicular faces The result of the measurements is displayed in Figure 13\(b This result differs substantially from the one of the ideal scenario simulated before see Figure 13\(a due to multiple causes such as the imperfections of the testing environment and of the setup and the inaccurate model for the real antennas However the measurement result fundamentally supports the proposed antenna system as it shows that a beamforming approach provides a better directivity than using individual antennas   90 o 60 o 30 o 0 o 30 o 60 o 90 o 120 o 150 o 180 o 150 o 120 o 10 dB 0

we consider a lunar orbit placing a single patch antenna on the cubesatês outer surface will not sufìce for establishing a reliable downlink Y et the swarm diversity can be used to improve the signal-to-noise SNR of the link by as much as 10 dB The pointing of the downlink antennas will not matter as much as ISL antennas and as a result they can be placed on a single facet of the spacecraft A good solution for this is to place the antennas on the backside of the solar panels After considering the design of proposed by Klein in the available space for downlink antennas resulted to be two areas of 41  4 cm  34 cm one on each of the two panels and a thickness of 0  7 mm with an FR-4 available substrate With these being said the driver of the design was to build a high gain more than 10 dBi antenna system that would help the system downlink data towards Earth while loosening the requirements for the EPS and for the ground station Design and implementation The objective of the design process of the downlink antenna system was to optimize the RF properties of the system directivity side-lobe level beamwidth while efìciently using the available resources materials area thickness Also in this case the cubesat platform is a very important limiting factor in the design process The low power available to establish a link with a ground BS imposes the need of a high-gain system Furthermore the use of a standardized deployer bounds not only the available space but also the type of structure to be used Since the solar panels have to t into the ISISPOD alongside the cubesat the y require to be modular foldable structures The solution proposed by Klein speciìes that each solar panel is made out of  v e pieces each 34 cm  8  2 cm As a result a single antenna per panel implementation would not use the area efìciently since it could occupy only one fth of the available surface A more suitable implementation is to build an array of simple planar antennas and feed them through integrated microstrip lines Aperture-fed patches make an excellent candidate and can be implemented using the FR-4 substrate We opted thus 6

Simulations To evaluate the performance of the proposed downlink array we built an analytical model using CST and conducted farìeld simulations The model made use of available material characterizations for the FR-4 substrate The metallic parts were modeled as perfect electric conductor PEC as their inîuence is not signiìcant Figure 16 shows the radiation pattern of the ve-by-four array of patches when considering uniform and binomial power distribution in the feed network It can be observed that in the binomial case the performance in terms of beamwidth and side-lobe level is better at the cost of a lower directivity     25  5 15  35 dBi 30  210  60  240  90  270  120  300  150  330  180  0    Uniform  Binomial  Figure 16  Farìeld radiation pattern of a single panel array The selection of the power weighting scheme will also depend on other subsystems of the cubesat For example a stabilized cubesat with precise pointing capabilities will make use the higher directivity scheme while an unstabilized spacecraft would be better off with a scheme that has a larger beamwidth and radiates less power outside the main beam In addition we simulated a setup consisting of two identical panels that were placed 56  4 cm apart center-to-center The value of the spacing is the result of adding the sizes of the panels the size of the cubesat and the size of the supporting rods yokes for the solar arrays Binomial power distribution was assigned to both arrays The resulted farìeld radiation pattern is plotted in Figure 17 It can be seen that the scheme exhibit sa3dB increase This is due to the fact that the spacing between the radiating edges of the two arrays is roughly one wavelength However if spacing between the panels will increase or the wavelength will decrease this will result in a high-level of the sidelobes The 3 dB increase in directivity can still be attained  15  5 15 35 dBi 30  210  60  240  90  270  120  300  150  330  180  0    Dual panel  Single panel  Figure 17  Farìeld radiation pattern of the dual-array system for any desired direction of transmission with the adequate phase shifting between the two arrays A similar algorithm as in the ISL scenario can be employed 6 F UTURE W ORK AND CONCLUSIONS Current work focuses on the RF aspects of a low-frequency radio telescope implemented with a swarm of nano-satellites Although based on a well-known theoretical consideration fulìlling the science task will be very challenging from the hardware point of view Morever the novel cubesat implementation takes all the challenges to a new level We proposed a simple functional architecture for a nanosatellite to be used for low-frequency radio astronomy and to that the design considerations of the multiple required antenna systems were attached Three separate systems were implemented to fulìll each of the main sub-tasks radio observation ISL and downlinking processed data to the BS The astronomical antennas were designed according to the need to detect signals from all directions thus the system uses of three orthogonal very long dipoles with nite ground planes Simulations were performed to analyze the effect of this non ideal conìguration Due to the nite ground plane the monopoles do not have antenna patterns that match the theoretical values for monopoles on inìnite ground planes However in forming dipoles of antipodal pairs the expected patterns are recovered for two of the three pairs over the full operational band Due to the non symmetrical antenna deployment and the extended dipole 8 


gap the antenna pattern of the third pair is not recovered for a small range around the half wave resonance A conformal antenna system using circular polarized patches was designed to establish and maintain a communication link between cubesats regardless of their relative orientation A beamforming approach was necessary to provide the required gain for any link direction The simulation and measurements conìrmed the plausibility of the system Further work on the individual antenna needs to be done to meet the polarization and bandwidth requisites Lastly a downlink array was developed and accommodated by the solar panels The residual space available on the deployable structures was used to create a high-directivity system This can be exploited to make requirements for other subsystems of the cubesat e.g EPS less harsh As stated in Section 5 the performance of this system strongly depends on the downlinking strategy or the pointing capabilities of the satellites Until now the antenna system was individually designed Future work will have as a mindset the nal implementation of the OLFAR cubesat The integration of the systems into the platform and compatibility analysis still have to be done A CKNOWLEDGMENTS This research is supported by the Dutch Technology Foundation STW which is part of the Netherlands Organization for Scientiìc Research NWO project 10556 OLFAR
