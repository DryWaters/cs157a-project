lower birthrate make the competition tougher in higher education. Trying to enhance its educational quality so as to increase its compatibility is the major concern for every university or college. On the other hand, the Institute of Engineering Education Taiwan \(IEET\ become a signatory of the Washington Accord, which makes accreditation of engineering programs to be considered as an assurance of the educational quality In preparing the IEET accreditation, one key issue should be addressed: continuous improvement. In a successful engineering education, continuous improvement should be fulfilled through all phases: curriculum, speech or talk listening, practical training, industrial visiting, contest attending and undergraduate research. When it falls into the 
scope of teaching, an instructor should enhance his/her teaching skill and improve student learning. For the latter, it will be beneficial if an instructor have an instrument that can forecast a studentês learning outcome based on some relevant factors. Once a student is predicted to get bad grade its teacher can strengthen the studentês learning difficulty at the beginning of a course In order to solve this issue, this paper proposes a decision support of integrating data mining \(DM\ and Bayesian belief networks \(BBN\itatively predict studentsê learning. The methodologies involves four steps 1\g fuzzy theory to identify the influence factors on learning outcomes through related work analysis and questionnaires; \(2\using data mining to analyze the 
relationships among the factors and then to construct influence diagram; \(3\sing machine learning to establish the probability tables in BBN through questionnaires and parameter learning; \(4\ the model to predict the exam scores at the beginning of course and thereby to help students enhance their scores according to their weakness Total of 427 freshmen in Ming Chi University of Technology \(Taiwan\ did questionnaires to assist this study II  L EARNING F ACTORS OF C ALCULUS  Calculus is considered an example herein and this section will investigate student learning factors of calculus. Letês review educational productivity theory first. In 1981 
Wa ed a m odel for educational productivity in which nine factors were identified that promote student learning. These nine factors were later grouped in three sets The first set indicates a student's aptitude-attributes and contains the student's prior achievement as measured by the usual standardized tests, the student's motivation, which is indicated by tests that measure whether a student is willing to persevere with learning tasks, and finally, the student's developmental level, usually measured by a student's chronological age or stage of maturation. The second set of factors indicates those instructional aspects which affect student learning and achievement namely the quantity and quality of instruction. The quantity of instruction is defined 
as the amount of time students spend learning and the quality of instruction concerns the degree to which knowledge or skills are clearly presented to students. The last set of factors consists of the social-psychological environment, which includes the educational environment, the home environment and the peer environment, as well as exposure to mass media The classroom environment, positive stimulation from the home environment, and support from peers affect student learning directly, but also indirectly through a student's prior achievement, motivation, and resp onsiveness to instruction That exposure to mass media might be less relevant for students in higher education The educational productivity model was the starting point 
for at least 120 research syntheses and the basis for many regression analyses. Not only do review studies show that the model is indeed effective in examining the major determinants of the learning process, but also has the model been widely validated in samples of primary and secondary students, in various subject areas ranging from mathematics ___________________________________ 978-161284 840-2  11 26.00 ©201 1 IEEE

Therefore, roughly speaking, a university has students of similar intellectual levels; whereas two universities have different levels of students particularly if they are distant on the spectrum of university entrance exams. More specifically, every university should have its own relevant factors and decision support when its instructors intend to predict studentsê learning. In establishing a decision support, related data should collect from same level of students The Ming Chi University of Technology in Taiwan is taken as the case study. This study focused on the 427 freshmen in the classes of calculus A  Selecting Important Factors First, not all factors listed in section II are relevant for this class and therefore the 427 students in this university is asked to answer the first questionnaire of selecting important factors. For example, the votes for factor d3 \(interest shown in Figure 1 which shows that most students in this university agree interest important. The normalized 


distribution of this vote for d3 can be considered a membership function  d3 or possibility distribution  d3  fuzzy concept èthe importance of d3ê in this university which is shown in Figure 2. Five standard levels of describing importance are very high, high, moderate, low and very low importance, which are demonstrated in Figure 3. Matching the fuzzy set of èthe importance of d3ê and the five levels of importance can result in a similarity distribution, as shown in Figure 4. The similarities are 0.561 0.813, 0.529, 0.260 and 0.248 respectively. This implies that the factor d3 is most similar the concept of èhigh importance,ê thereby this factor is taken as relevant factor of learning calculus for this university   Figure 1  Votes for agreeing the factor èinterestê important   Figure 2  Fuzzy set of importance of the factor èinterest  Figure 3  Fuzzy sets of five levels of importance; very high, high moderate, low and very low  Figure 4  Similarities between fuzzy set èimportance of d3ê and five levels Through the same procedure, the 24 relevant factors are sifted out from the 39 factors if their highest similarity is high or above. The relevant factors are c1, d3, d4, d5, e1, e2 e3, e4, e5, e6, e7, e8, e9, f1, f2, f3, f4, g1, g2, g3, h1, h2, h3 and h4 B  Construct influence diagram Association rule mining finds interesting associations and/or correlation relationships among set of data items Association rules show attribute value conditions that occur frequently together in a given dataset. A typical and widelyused example of association rule mining is Market Basket Analysis. Association rules provide information of this type in the form of "if-then" statements. These rules are computed from the data and, unlike the if-then rules of logic association rules are probabilistic in nature In addition to the antecedent \(the "if" part\ and the consequent \(the "then" part\association rule has two numbers that express the degree of uncertainty about the rule In association analysis the antecedent and consequent are sets of items \(called itemsets\ that are disjoint \(do not have any items in common\. The first number is called the support for the rule. The support is simply the number of transactions that include all items in the antecedent and consequent parts of the rule. \(The support is sometimes expressed as a percentage of the total number of records in the database The other number is known as the confidence of the rule Confidence is the ratio of the number of transactions that include all items in the consequent as well as the antecedent namely, the support\he number of transactions that include all items in the antecedent In total 70 association rules \(antecedent  consequent support, confidence\ are generated with more than 0.3 support and 0.8 confidence. The relationships among these 24 relevant factors are too complicated and need trimming in order to reduce its complexity. The trimming principles are   Combination: two or more rules can be combined if they have the same consequent   Avoiding loops: one of two or more than two rules with lower confidence will be deleted if they form loop as shown in Figure 5   Avoiding multiple paths: one of two paths with the same destination will be deleted as shown in Figure 6  d3   d3  


According to the trimming principle, the final association rules left are presented in Figure 7, which is an influence diagram of 20 factors     Figure 5  Avoiding loops among association rules     Figure 6  Avoiding multiple paths with the same destination  Figure 7  Inflence diagram for prediction studentsê learning outcomes of calculus C  Establishing probability tables in BBN The 427 freshmen in this university are further asked to answer another questionnaire to describe their individual situations.  According to their answers, only 397 questionnaires are useful and the probability tables in BBN can be established through statistics. For example, in Figure 7, there exists a probability table of f1, f3 and f4. There can be five answers for these three factors: very high \(1\, high \(2 moderate \(3\w \(4\, very low \(5\; therefore, the conditional probabilistic distribution in this probability table has in total 125 conditional probabilities, as listed in TABLE I TABLE I  CONDITIONAL PROBABILITIES OF F 4 W  R  T F 1 AND F 3  1: very high; 2: high; 3: moderate; 4:  low; 5: very low  D  Inference The 26 th questionnaire with 66-point score in an exam is taken as an example herein to demonstrate the inference. Its inputs are 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2 and 3 for c1, d4, e2, e7, e8 f2, g1, g3, h2 and h3, and the predicted grade for this case results in a probability distribution of 0.0872, 0.1088, 0.1698 0.4456, 0.1222 and 0.06 64 over [90    60   e sp ect ivel y, as shown in Fi gure  8. Now three fuzzy sets èhigh grade,ê èmoderate gradeê and low gradeê are defined in Figure 10. The similarities matching the possibility distribution over six grades of the sixth and the three fuzzy sets èhigh grade,ê èmoderate grade and èlow gradeê are 1.000, 0.64 8 and 0.402. That is, this student is predicted that he/she will get high grade in the course of calculus E  Validation The 427 students in this university are then used to validate the decision support by input their answers again into this system. The prediction is acceptable if a student with a score between 80 and 100, 60 and 79, and 0 and 59 is forecasted highest possibility falling into èhigh grade moderate gradeê and èlow grade,ê respectively. The accuracy rate is then 61.7% \(245 out of 397\. Another prediction is acceptable if a student with a score between 60 and 100, and 0 and 59 is forecasted highest possibility falling into èhigh gradeê or èmoderate grade,ê and èlow grade respectively. The accuracy rate is then 82.6% \(328 out of 397    


 Figure 8  Probabilistic inference results for the 26 th student IV  C ONCLUSIONS  A decision support system of integrating DM and BBN is designed to predict the student learning outcomes. It contains four steps: fuzzy theory to identify the factors on learning outcomes; data mining to construct influence diagram machine learning to establish probability tables; and the model to predict the exam scores at the beginning of course and thereby to help students enhance their scores according to their weakness. This system is acceptable because the accuracy rate of prediction on passing calculus is 82.6 A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The authors would like to thank the National Science Council of Taiwan for financially supporting this research under Contract NSC 98-2511-S-131 - 001 R EFERENCES  1  H.J.

mining procedures. Our motivation in this study is to utilize the redundancy for extracting algorithm of fuzzy association rules IV. IMPROVEMENT OF APRIORI ALGORITHM BASED ON If max{Conf\(Z ? y X ? y max{CF\(Z ? y X ? y ZEQ Proof From the assumption, there exist P E Q that satisfY Con/\(P ? y X ? Y P ? y 0: CF\(X ? Y CF\(X ? y P ? Y Z ? V ZEQ 70 The necessary point in the Apriori algorithm for extracting association rules is to generate the frequent item sets efficiently Though the confidence of the association rules are calculated mally after all decision of frequent itemsets in traditional Apriori algorithm, the basic idea of our proposal is that the confidence of the rule can be calculated after each step A3 in the Apriori algorithm and used for pruning the redundant itemsets. The issue is to decide which itemset should be pruned utilizing the confidence information. Then we define "strong redundant rule" and "strong redundant itemset Confidence 1.0 2 3 4 The number of items Figure 2. Conceptual Diagram of Pruning Method Definition 2: Let X ? Y be a fuzzy association rule, where X and Yare fuzzy item sets. Let Q be Q = 2 x - X If min\(ConJ\(Z ?Y X ?Y ZEQ X ? Y strong redundant rule Let k-rule denote the rule that has k attributes\(items consequent part, and the "subset rule" denote that itemset corresponding to the rule is subset of the item set of larger rule and the consequent parts of both rules are the same set Definition 3: Let Z be a fuzzy itemset that has k items\( k>2 When all the k-rules generated from Z are strong redundant, we call the itemset Z strong redundant itemset Fig.2 shows the concept of strong redundant rule and strong redundant itemset. Since the Apriori algorithm generates the candidate itemsets in tum from l-itemsets, the pruning based 


on the redundancy should be performed simultaneously In addition to the basic Apriori algorithm, the following procedures are employed for k> I as A4 confidence of k-rule based on Lk and Lk.j AS The concept of the procedure is that the confidence value of rule should increase by increasing the number of antecedent items. In other words, the procedure is based on valid heuristics that the combination of items in antecedent part which deteriorates the confidence value will become redundant in the following iterations. We can expect reduction of computational time and redundant rules pruning by the additional procedures It should be noted that the confidence calculation in each iteration does not lead to the increase of overall calculation time in association rules mining v. NUMERICAL EXAMPLES We develop the fuzzy mining system based on the redundancy pruning and evaluate the proposed algorithms through numerical examples. We apply the system to "abalone data" available from the vcr Machine Learning Repository[7 The abalone data set consists of 4177 measured data with 1 nominal attribute and 8 continuous attributes as shown in 71 Table. I. In the experiments, the nominal attribute is transformed to the continuous attribute. Table 2\(a statistics and the fuzzy partition information of attributes are summarized in Table 2\(b wider than the actual data distribution for performance evaluation. The fuzzy partition example is shown in Fig.3. We use two types of fuzzy sets with different width, i.e. triangle type and trapezoid type. Although it is better to use the factor such as "interesting" for pruning the derived rules in addition we apply the native association rule extraction for proposed algorithm evaluation.

The number of deleted rules by the proposed algorithm Fig.5 shows the results of reduction of itemsets by the proposed algorithm. We can see that fair itemsets are pruned by the proposed method. Fig.6 shows the number of extracted rules by the conventional Apriori algorithm. Many redundant rules are extracted as well as the necessary non-redundant rules Our issue is to restrain the extraction of redundant rules. Fig.7 shows the results of the number of deleted rules by the proposed algorithm. Some redundant rules are deleted simultaneously along with frequent itemsets extraction However, since a few non-redundant rules are also unexpectedly deleted at the lower threshold value of minimal confidence, we have to investigate further about heuristics, i.e strong redundant itemsts and relation of threshold values. It should be noted that the number of deleted rules has less dependence on the minimal confidence These results are promising in terms of computational time and redundant rules pruning. However, the improvement is limited in terms of computational time. We consider that the performance of the proposed method must be improved by applying the output field specification method[17]. We expect that the number of pruned rules becomes larger based on the specifications. Moreover, the other measures to prevent redundant rules extraction in fuzzy association rules mining 


could be applied as well as the proposed algorithm VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we proposed a basic algorithm based on the Apriori algorithm for rule extraction utilizing redundancy of the extracted rules, in order to improve the efficiency of the association rules mining and to prune the redundant rules extracted. We also proved the redundancy defmition of the rule based on the CF\(certainty factor algorithm was evaluated through numerical experiments using benchmark data, "Abalone". From the results, the method was found to be promising in terms of computational time and redundant rule pruning. Our future plan includes sophistication of the proposed algorithm, application to the huge data mining problem, and further improvement of fuzzy association rules mining REFERENCES I] R.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK This paper first discusses the theory of foundations and association rules and presents an association rules mining algorithm, namely, FP-growth algorithm.

The experimental evaluation demonstrates its scalability is much better than algorithm FP-growth 177 Now, lets forecast something we want to do someday Firstly, we would parallelize our algorithm, because data mining needs massive computation, and a parallelable environment could high improve the performance of the algorithm; Secondly, we would apply our algorithm on much more datasets and study the run performance; At last, we would study the performance when the algorithm deal with other kinds of association rules  REFERENCES 1] S.

Pruning experiences at support 0.25  V. DISCUSSION AND CHALLENGES It is important to discuss the technique presented here with focus on the purpose the technique pursues:  to produce semantic recommendation The reader should have noticed that the algorithm presented 


relies strongly on "choice". For instance, the algorithm chooses ears in the graph to form an order for elimination, and the choice is arbitrary. This strategy is essential to maintain low complexity \(polynomial practical. Nevertheless, a warned reader may conclude that this arbitrary choice implies that there are many compactions to produce and therefore the approach as a whole does not show to produce an optimal solution. And the reader is right in this conclusion. Since the goal is compaction, the search for an optimal solution can be bypassed provided a substantial level of pruning is achieved To complete the whole view, we describe how web service descriptions are complemented with the association rules as recommendations. In effect, under our scheme, the document describing the web service is augmented with a set of OWL/RDF/S triples that only incorporate the non-pruned rules with the format of Example 1, that is, the set ARmin of the compaction program obtained by our algorithm, together with the thresholds applied to the mining process and a registered URI of a registered description service. The assumptions and defeaters are not added to the web service description. If the associations encoded in the triples are not sufficient for the client \(a search engine, for instance widening of the response to the description service identified by the given URI, and then the assumptions and defeaters are produced. The reasoning task required for deriving all the implicitly published rules is client responsibility Notice that, under this scheme, the actual rules that appear as members of the set initial ARmin set are irrelevant; the only important issue is the size of the set The developed scheme also supports an extension of the algorithm that admits the assignment of priorities to rules and to itemsets, in order to allow the user to produce a more controlled program as output. Nonetheless, the importance of the extension has not been already tested, and therefore it is beyond the subject of the present paper It would be also interesting to design a scheme that supports queries where the client provides an itemset class and values for support and confidence and the engine produces a maximal class of inferred associated itemsets as a response. This scheme is also under development, so we have not discussed this aspect here 


VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have presented a defeasible logic framework for managing associations that helps in reducing the number of rules found in a set of discovered associations. We have presented an induction algorithm for inducing programs in our logic, made of assumption schemas, a reduced set of association rules and a set of counter-arguments to conclusions called defeaters, guaranteeing that every pruned rule can be effectively inferred from the output. Our approach outperform those of [17], because all reduction compactions presented there can be expressed and induced in our framework, and several other patterns, particular to the given datasets, can also be found. In addition, since a set of definite clauses can be obtained from the induced programs, the knowledge obtained can be modularly inserted in a richer inference engine Abduction can be also attempted, asking for justifications that explain the presence of certain association in the dataset The framework presented can be extended in several ways Admitting defeaters to appear in the head of assumption, to define user interest Admitting arithmetic expressions within assumptions for adjustment in pruning Admitting set formation patterns as itemset constants Extending the scope, to cover temporal association rules REFERENCES 1]  R.
