Transforming the Ocean Sciences hrough Cabled Observatories Chris Barnes University of Victoria, Vi ctoria, British Columbia The NEPTUNE Canada Project plans to complete the world\222s first, regional cabled ocean observatory across the northern Juan de Fuca tectonic plate, off Canada\222s west coast, in late 2009.  The $100M observatory will compri se five main observatory sites \(in 100m coastal to 2700m abyssal plain depths\that delivers 10kVDC power and 10Gbps communications bandwid th to hundreds of sensors over at least 25 years. Bringing abundant powe r and high bandwidth to diverse ocean environments, establishing a vast data archive and enabling multidisciplinary interactive experiments with novel instrumentation in real time will transform the ocean sciences and complement other ocean observing systems. The observatory will investiga\te a great diversity of Earth/ocean processes phenomena and events, and is expandable The science experiments will focus on five ma jor themes: earthquake and plate dynamics and tsunami hazards; fluid fluxes in the oc ean crust and sediments, including resultant gas hydrate deposits; ocean and climate dynamics, in cluding acidification, nutrient fluxes and impacts on the biota; deep-sea ecosyst ems dynamics; and applied engineering and computer science research The project has been developed in partnership with the US and NSF\222s Ocean Observatories Initiative. Japan, Taiwan, China, India, and the EU are all in the planning stages of cabled observatories leading to a progressive wiring of the oceans over the next decade

shown that this method is flawed as Denmark has a lower CO 2 emissions level when using the consumption accounting principle 2  IPCC Approach IPCC approach also commonly referred to as geographical approach and territorial approach \(Bastianoni 2004\, incorporates the reference approach and sectoral approach \(Ferng, 2003\; where the model considers CO 2  emissions produced in each sector of the nation within the country boundaries. The model does not consider CO 2  emissions indirectly related to the chain of production process, such as transportation and consumption. This method is similar to the polluter-pay principle where responsibility is assigned to direct emitters \(Ferng, 2003\. It only considers the amount of ‘national direct CO 2 emissions which will likely lead to the problem of ‘carbon leakage Ferng, 2003\ and not attaining the expected results of the combat against carbon reduction globally This is thought to be an inefficacious and unfair system of CO 2 emission accountability method and is especially evident in the case where a country has to be responsible for the goods that it has neither produced nor consumed, when the only reason for it to be responsible is its geographical location which is between the production country and the consumption country, where the goods has to be transit Another disadvantage is that it uses a standardized method at a local level, and the emission data are mostly based on estimates where default emission factors are recommended whenever precise national data are unavailable; although IPCC presents a rich database whenever possible. Thus, this approach has a high degree of uncertainty due to the lack of appropriate and accurate estimation models and the variability in the time and space This high uncertainty in the emission inventories level would in turn deter the process of cost reduction strategies for reducing global GHG emissions In the following section, we will look at consumer accountability approaches which are directly opposite to the producer accountability approaches mentioned earlier D  Consumer Accountability Model Consumer accountability models include the Consumption Accounting Method, Benefit principle and Ecological Deficit principle, which hold the consumers responsible for the carbon emission 1  Consumption Accounting Method The consumption accounting principle suggested that consumers are to be responsible for the CO 2 emissions from the production to the final usage of goods and services regardless of whether they are imported or domestically produced. This model considers CO 2 emissions caused by domestic consumption including emissions embodied in imports The main drawback of consumption accounting method is the consumer inability of influence on the technologies and fuels used in the production of imported commodities in the origin country 2  Benefit Principle The benefit principle is different to the IPCC approach and is similar to the consumption principle of Munksgaard 2001\s it recognizes the driving forces behind the production activities that emit pollutants and assigns the responsibility to the force-drivers. It argues that production and consumption activities are both responsible for the CO 2  emissions and not confined to the area where only production and consumption activities occur. This model calculates the ‘national responsible CO 2 emissions’ for the responsibility sharing of the reduction of global GHG emissions The criteria to be considered in this model are the goods and services produced and consumed, directly and indirectly in the residential consumption of a defined country \(Ferng 2003\. The term ‘defined country’ refers to a country who is responsible for the amount of CO 2 emissions from the production of commodities required directly and indirectly for residential consumption, regardless of where the production activities is held; and also from the domestic consumption of energy products \(Ferng, 2003 There are two subcategories in the benefit principle namely the ‘consumption-benefit principle’ and the production-benefit principle Under the consumption-benefit principle, a defined country is responsible for CO 2 emissions from the production of goods and services regardless of where the production activities are located for supporting its domestic residential consumption; as well for the CO 2 emissions from its domestic residential consumption of energy products Whereas, under the production-benefit principle, the subjects to be considered are the goods and services produced by the production sectors located in the defined country; and also the imported goods and services required directly and indirectly for the transportation of commodities into the production facilities in the defined country \(Ferng 2003\. Therefore, the defined country is responsible for the CO 2 emissions produced domestically in the country for local consumption and exports; as well as for CO 2 emissions associated with its imported production inputs; and from the logistics of the raw commodities to the production facilities Ferng, 2003 One of the advantages of benefit principle includes the discouragement of ‘carbon leakage’, and halts the process of environmental degradation from CO 2 emissions in both developed and developing countries \(Ferng, 2003\. It is more beneficial to developing countries than the IPCC approach when the consumption-benefit principle is applied as it excludes the amount of CO 2 emissions from exports productions and would hopefully encourage more participation from developing countries The disadvantage of benefit principle is the possible double counting in the calculation of CO 2 emissions in countries CO 2 emissions inventory 3  Ecological Deficit Ecological deficit principle stems from the concept of Ecological Footprint Analysis’ initiated by Rees Wackernagel in the early 1990s \(1996; Ferng, 2003\. The Ecological Footprint Analysis is the estimation of resources and carbon sinks used or required by consumption and 
832 
832 
832 


production activities, and expresses these requirements in area units \(Ferng, 2003; Wackernagel & Rees, 1996\ This analysis incorporates the concept of both ‘consumptionbenefit’ and ‘production-benefit’ principles The ecological footprint analysis estimates the ecological deficit’ of the country itself. Ecological deficit is the excessive demand or the requirement of additional productive areas to support for local consumption and production beyond what can be offered by the country itself It serves as a rough index of self-sufficiency and differs from the ‘carrying capacity analysis’ as it explicitly considers the trans-boundary environmental pressures of the globalization of world economies \(Ferng, 2003 One of the benefits of Ecological Deficit principle include the ability to find out if a country domestic assimilation capacity has been overtaxed. Due to the idea and context of ‘self-sufficiency’ in the ecological deficit model it recognizes the carbon sink capacity of ecosystems; thus bringing awareness to the harmful deforestation activities globally, especially of tropical forests in developing countries \(Vojnovic, 1995; Ferng, 2003\. This accounting method will be beneficial to developing countries with massive forest areas as carbon credits, which will in turn help to halt the widespread of deforestation activities in these countries, enhancing and maintaining carbon sinks on a global scale. This will hopefully encourage higher participation rate from developing countries in the global combat of CO 2 emissions reduction Now that we have covered the basic concepts of accountability and the three major accountability approaches we now move on and discuss Input Output Analysis which forms the key component in these accountability models E  Input Output Analysis IO analysis is useful in accounting for GHG emissions and pollutants produced in the whole chain of production process of a particular good including the imported inputs used in the production process \(Wyckoff & Roop, 1994\ It is a suitable tool for assessment of resources and pollutants embodiments in goods and services on a macroeconomic scale \(Lenzen, 2006\. ‘The purpose of the IO analysis is to trace these interactions and to examine how policy alternatives modify the two-way flow process’ \(Forssell Polenske, 1998 The IO analysis method has many functions and is often used for the approximation of energy and estimation of anthropogenic CO 2 emissions at the stages of production and consumption as well as embodied energy and carbon from international trade of products. It is also used in assessment of the amount of carbon leakage, allocation of responsible environmental pressures to a region’s industries in terms of selective principle of territorial responsibility and the proposed benefit principle herein, as well as in the estimation of CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion. The major difference in the many versions of IO analysis in the current literature is the monetary versus the hybrid units of technical coefficients matrix \(Ferng, 2003 The hybrid version of the IO analysis has claimed to prevent the violation of energy conservation condition that might occur when monetary transaction tables are used in the estimation of embodied energy and energy intensity of products. The row entries corresponding to the energy sectors in an IO table are measured in physical units which consist of energy consumed as fuels and as raw materials and the estimated figures are the amounts of energy/carbon embodied in products under the hybrid method \(Ferng 2003 Whilst the monetary method estimates CO 2 emissions by combining monetary coefficients with information regarding the primary fossil fuels combusted at the stages of production and consumption and the coefficients of CO 2  emissions \(Ferng, 2003\. In this method, the amount of energy combusted or CO 2 emissions at stages of production and consumption can be estimated separately. The place domestic areas or foreign countries where the energy combustion occurred and CO 2 emitted can be distinguished under this method  Although the monetary method might violate the conservation condition, it could also have correct estimates when applied to the final demand of the base case from which the model is initially derived \(Miller & Blair 1985; Ferng, 2003 In the next section, we will present to you who should be responsible for the carbon emitted into the environment producers or consumers F  Producer OR Consumer Responsibility Producers are the direct emitters of CO 2 and are usually expected to be responsible for all the pollutants emitted into the environment as there are economics and monetary benefits associated in the whole chain of production Consumers on the other hand are also expected to be responsible for their ‘actions’ as it is believed that consumption is the sole end purpose of all production Adam Smith; Lenzen, 1998\he consumption of products has also social and economic benefits to the consumers Monetary benefit is possible in some cases where consumers are also the producers of products and/or services Since production benefit in income generation and consumption benefit in living standards are the two major impetus of the contribution to the degradation of the environment, the excessive CO 2 emissions should be shared by both producers and consumers \(Ferng, 2003 However, there are not many studies on the accountability of CO 2 emissions for the ICT industry in the literature yet. Therefore, our research aims at identifying the various stakeholders of the ICT industry and the shared responsibility of anthropogenic CO 2 emissions that each stakeholder should bear for the operation of data server centers III  R ESEARCH ISSUES  From the literature study that we conducted, we have identified the following problems with emission accountability   CO 2 Embodiment How to account for national CO 2 emissions for open economises considering the embodiment of CO 2 in international trade 
833 
833 
833 


  International Trade & CO 2 Is it right to charge a nation for CO 2 emissions generated in their space for products or services that are designed for export or for foreigners who are living in other countries   Producer vs. Consumer Responsibility Who should be responsible for emitting CO 2 into the atmosphere   Right Accounting Principle Which accounting principle is more appropriate \(i.e. consumer accounting vs. producer accounting\ Currently most of the policies are based on producer accountability why not include consumer accounting principles and study the comparative benefits of each approach   Emissions per Consumer Given consumers are held responsible for emissions how would you measure the amount of emissions generated per consumer are they any models that exist to measure this. It is a long and complex process to assign a emission value to a particular product since it is a result of a complex supply chain process \(i.e. the process from fetching the raw materials to processing it to final products and to shipping it to the warehouses or retail stores and the fuel consumed by the customer to go and buy the product   Carbon Leakage  It is a problem caused by inconsistency of the accountability of GHG emissions on a global scale, specifically carbon emissions by non-participating countries produced for participants of the Kyoto Protocol. A successful outcome can be attained when there is global participation with a burden-sharing scheme that is fair to both developed and developing countries Ferng, 2003\Thus in this case, we might suggest our own accountability model to correct this problem’ and the amount of responsibility to be bear by entities involved in the chain of production to end consumption in the case of data centers Given the research issues anticipated, we will first identify all determinant factors in CO 2 emissions accountability in ICT industry. With the information on hand, we will craft out a scenario with the stakeholders involved and then evaluate the carbon emissions using both consumer and producer accountability models. We will then identify the approach that is more beneficial in the combat against carbon mitigation and proceed with the development of an accountability model for the ICT industry. We will also measure the associated GHG emissions from operating the data centers and discourage any carbon leakage issues in these areas whenever possible. We hope to bring the issue on the balance of carbon sink and sequestration to attention as well IV  S IGNIFICANCE OF RESEARCH  Scientific Significance   One of the first studies to do a comparative analysis on the impact of consumer benefit principle versus producer benefit principle for the CO 2 emissions generated by the operation of data centers   This research will provide new literature in the area of accountability in carbon emissions, sustainability of data centers, manufacturing costs and end pricing etc   Development of new framework for accountability for maintaining data server centers in ICT industry Socio-Economic Significance   As the world is trying very hard and working jointly against mitigating carbon emission into the environment to provide a better environment, more carbon-intensive industries will be included into climate treaties globally. With the latest climate change policies in act, this research on accountability will address those concerns such as who is responsible for carbon emissions, which is a fair accounting principle i.e. consumer vs. producer benefit principle, etc   The output of this research would have policy implications and could be used by Governments worldwide in deciding which accounting principle to adopt for CO 2 emissions by ICT industry The outcome of this research would benefit companies in ICT sector in their employment of better business strategies and business sustainability, and also reduction of CO 2  emission into the environment V  C ONCLUSION  We have aimed to develop an efficient and effective just CO 2 emission accountability model for the ICT industry to assist companies in doing their part to cope with the recent climate change policies under the Kyoto Protocol and COP15 treaty. This research will first determine the factors of influence in the ICT industry and then focus on the development of the accountability model for the industry Evaluations will be made on the newly developed accountability model against the current producer and consumer accountability approaches. Suggestions for future works along this path and area will also be mentioned  R EFERENCES  1  Australian Government, Department of Climate Change \(n.d Reducing Australia’s emissions - Think Change http://www.climatechange.gov.au/government/reduce.aspx  Retrieved: Jan 08, 2010 2  Bastianoni, S., Pulselli, F.

VIRTUALIZED COMPUTER INFRASTRUCTURES  Initially, IBM invented Virtualization to extend a single task system to multitasking systems. A modern hypervisor transfers the old ideas to state of the art hardware, considering the entity of an OS with all installed software as \223Guest\224 or task  Vendors of virtualization software developed many sophisticated features and tools around the core of virtualization in order to the range of additional value for virtualization users  Physical to Virtual - P2V Before any virtualization can commence, it is necessary to find ways to convert an existing physical machine into a VM. Conversion is a procedure of transferring a physical computer with all of its hardware the installed OS and applications into a \223Virtual Machine\224  The definition of a Virtual Machine according to Forrester Research is as follows  A virtual machine is stored as a set of files in a directory in the DATASTORE. A virtual disk inside each virtual machine is one or more files in the directory. As a result, you can operate on a virtual disk \(copy move, backup,\205\ just like a file. New virtual disks can be \223hot added\224 to a virtual machine without powering it off. In this case a virtual disk file \(.vmdk\ is created in a V irtual M achine F ile S ystem \(VMFS to provide new storage for the hot added virtual disk or an existing virtual disk file associated with a virtual machine  Vendors in the field of virtualization software are offering software tools for P2V purposes. Physical machines can be virtualized on the fly, i.e. while they are running and performing their usual work. Other methods are using boot-CDs, hard disks or hard disk images to convert a computer. Furthermore back-up file formats of most important back-up solution providers are supported as base for a P2V conversion   Virtual Infrastructure The real benefits of virtualization become possible with the implementation of a virtual infrastructure layer Virtualization software vendors coined the term \223cloud computing\224 for this issue. One of these vendors even claims to offer the first \223cloud computing operating system\224   Picture 4 Set of host computers administrated by a Virtualization Layer with numerous "Guests\224   The infrastructure layer abstracts hardware to a very high degree. The layer considers no individual elements of hardware but it pools all available rescores instead. The virtual infrastructure would provide the aggregate of RAM of MHz to potential guests. All features regarding redundancy and high  availability 


are configured and maintained within the \223Administrat ion layer\224. The \223administration layer\224 itself can even just be a Guest in the virtual environment  Along with the implementation of the administration layer the storage philosophy needs to be adapted to benefit from virtualization. Virtual machine files should be no longer physically located on a hard disk of an individual server, but on a common S torage A rea N etwork \(SAN\ instead. Now the critical point of failure has changed in virtualized environments from the hard-disk of an individual server to the SAN  Flexibility Virtual machines handled by system management software must not continuously reside on an initially assigned computer. In fact a \223Guest\224 can move around while still provid ing all service from one physical machine to another. This feature enables hardware maintenance without risks and interruption of computer operation in a very simple way  A growing demand of resources by additional applications or increased machine load can be covered by adding new machines and distributing the Guests differently in the extended cluster This process can even be automated, meaning that load balancing between computer resources can be realized without manual inte rvention \(if the hardware is already in place  Rapid provisioning and backup As said before, a virtual machine is in essence just a file on file system. This file represents a computer with everything in it, to run on a virtualization host This hardware independence enables administrators to create clones of working images for roll out purposes In case of tests of hot fixes or updates, snapshots of the running machine can be taken to which one can revert in case a test fails Backups are simplified a lot, because third party tools are almost obsolete  Quick recovery After a failure \226no matter hard- or software caused a virtual machine can reboot automatically elsewhere in the virtual environment in order to keep the service. As this type of quick recovery causes interruptions to computer operation it is not suitable for process automation purposes  Failover Real failover has only been available in commercial products since approximately two years. In principle it consists of a foreground Guest VM with a \223Shadow-VM\224 of this Guest running in the background on different hardware of the resource pool. The shadow VM is an identical bit-copy of the foreground machine. It would become activated in case the foreground machine suffers a hardware breakdown  Both features, Failover and Quick Recovery make use of the mobility of Virtual Ma chines in administrated environments The applied principle to achieve failover is highly comparable with system backup software which is capable of backing up system partitions while the system is running  The working principle is a method which takes a snap-shot at a point in time and monitors the deviation to the snap shot while the initial snap shot is taken. The procedure is applied as long as the delta file size between snapshot and data to be copied\ero. At this moment the Copy-VM takes over The dead time for taking over by the Shadow-VM is just some \(we only found one\ packets - thus just some milliseconds  But beware  Breakdowns caused by \223buggy\224 software are not covered by this technology, because the shadow-VM would crash as well  


Impact on automation layout in a cement plant Next picture shows a generic control system layout as used at HeidelbergCement with logical segregation of production stages and an \223automation backbone\224 which connects subordinate control systems  Each control system consists of a redundant set of servers for failsafe reasons   Picture 5 Standard PCS layout  Process control systems are typically installations which are subject to evolution rather than to revolution Most cement plants would never do a \223one-shot replacement\224 of an installed system \(or version\ by another but proceed in steps  Logically, the approach towards virtualization is logically very similar to PCS upgrades The reason for the reference plant which introduced Virtualization Technology in 2008 for online control purposes were hardware failures and obsolete hardware for Windows-NT-based-CEMAT-V4-control systems The first machine to be virtualized was not \223mission critical\224 but represented in principle the entire functionality of CEMAT V4. It was an engineering station which was set up as a combined \223server-clientengineering station\224  Almost at the same time, this plant introduced a Process Data Acquisition System \(Management Information System\. According to the vendor\222s specification, the whole system should be installed on 5 different computers \(Com-Server, OPC Server, Database Server,\205\ough it was obvious that it could be done on fewer machines the plant decided to follow the vendor\222s specification because of warranty issues. However, setting up 5 machines for a relatively unimportant job was considered to be excessive and as the virtualization platform was availabl e we utilized it for the PDAS installation  Due to the positive experience after step one, it was decided, to migrate also one PCS Server of the redundant server-set into a VM and install it to a host. The process control system software runs untouched on both machines and realizes failover between a physical and a virtual machine  The decisive steps at our pilot plant were also done at a relatively early point in time \(immediately after the tests with the engineering station were completed\ September 2008  The infrastructure software layer was installed \226although we could not use it extensively- almost at the very beginning, i.e. with the first host, in order to give our staff the opportunity to become familiarized with this new \(to automation people\y 


  Picture 6 PCS layout with virtual infrastructure and SAN  The second very important step was the installation and commissioning of a Storage Area Network SAN\, because only a network storage enables to make use of virtualization infrastructure features such as failover. This is due to the fact that virtual machine disk files may not exist on a certain host, as in case of failure it would not be accessible and available any longer to be restarted on a different physical host  SANs are either based on Fibre Channel or iSCSI Technology. The idea of both technologies is to extend the \(usually\nal data lines between hard disk controllers and hard-disks to external devices Fibre Channel has been a proven technology for this type application for years. It has a slightly better performance, but is more expensive than iSCSI iSCSI stands for Internet Small Computer System Interface It  means encapsulation  of the SCSI protocol within TCP/IP packages. Today iSCSI delivers sufficient performance to build up SANs for process automation purposes at a cement works  In such an arrangement, from a failure point of view, the SAN is the most critical peace of hardware in virtualized computer architecture  Although SANs are built up internally fail safe \(redundant power supply, NICs, hard disk controllers,\205 and data sheets give impressive figures for availability, any concept for process control purposes should allow for setting up auto-synchronizing SANs at different spots  User interface VMs running on a host are comparable to applications running on a Terminal Server. In other words, VMs obviously need input and output devices to be handled. Fat clients \(PC\222s\o good choice if it is intended to simplify the maintenance of the process control system hardware. Moreover, they are costly and sometimes prone to error Another step forward -with limited risk only- was to replace some operator stations of a segment by Thin Clients without hard disk The connection between thin client and VM is either done by vendor specific client software, RDP or VNC  Obstacles Minor issues may occur while transferring physical control systems into virtual ones Most of the problems the reference plant encountered had to do with the hardware interfaces such as serial and parallel ports and multi-media features  


Unresolved points \(minor\are to date realizing failover with legacy interfaces and sound output with Windows NT guests   CONCLUSION  Virtualization is no new but a revitalized technol ogy. First virtualization solutions \(purely based on software\ell as computer emulation deliver poor results in terms of performance  Hardware supported virtualization and pure software virtualization are totally different approaches  Virtualization today is most powerful when it combines the strengths of the different technologies. CPU demanding applications are wasting less performance than memory-intense application. \(TLB miss costs  VMware ESX is a good example of this. ESX uses Para-virtualized drivers for the most critical I/O components \(but not for the CPU\, emulation for the le ss important I/O and Binary Translation in order to avoid the high "trap and emulate" performance penalty. In this way, virtualized applications perform quite well, in some cases almost as if th ere were no extra VMM layer involved  The user benefit of virtualization is manifold. Virtualization 225  decouples software from hardware \(provides availability for \223legacy platforms\224, enables software in a cloud 225  utilizes installed hardware more efficient 225  safes space, energy, and invest cost 225  eases system administration extensively  225  but requires additional know-how of system administrators  At this point in time we can say that virtualization has met all of our expectations and offered \226in particular with respect to system administration- even more. The number of plants that started using Virtualization is growing  The process automation staff is still on a learning curve with virtualization in order to take maximum benefit of this technology  Unexploited potential is likely to be found in the field of setting up systems, handling of back-ups and disaster recovery procedures     REFERENCES  200  K.

The distance of the reflected beam from the center of the aperture is then used to calculate I  which varies from about -0.8\260 to +0.8\260 in the experiment Figures 24-28 show the change r I    found by taking the difference of the center of each spectral image and subtracting from its location when I and compared the modeled values over the same range of I Figure 23 illustrates that there is some amount of random error in these measurements, but overa ll the data is grouped around r 0 pixel difference between the measured and modeled values.

The mo unt itself was tilted in two directions to create the misalignment angles x and y as shown in Fig. 12.  The magnitudes of these angles were measured by a laser as described above.  The aperture was placed such that each mm of separation at the aperture equates to 0.25\260 of angle at th e prism.  Misalignment in the instrument was used that gave values x  0.5\260 y  0.5\260 x 0.75\260 and y  0.5\260 with the instrument design again limiting the amount of error that could be imparted  The r   p  expression from Equation 17 will be compared to see how the displacement of each of the 5 wavelengths as a function of rotation angle varies given the different I  due to misalignment as the prism rotates.

  14 error for angles and is +/-0.2\260 and is incorporated into the model prediction.  Results are shown in Figures 24-29  Here, the measured data match the overall trends of the model very well, with some slight offset of about 2 pixels in each of the r   p  comparisons.  This would lead to the assumption that the estimate of x is not accurate, but is likely not the case since the mean of the model is too high in the 404nm data, and too low in the 435nm data.  This indicates that there are other errors being observed, as again it is nearly impossible to lim it the measurement to error in the intended so urce.  Also, note the decrease in impact the rotation error has as wavelength increases.  This is due to the lowered bearing P has on p as shown in the previous section.  However, the error magnitudes are a ratio of the distance from the undeviated wavelength, and in this data set are large due the large fractional error of and   4  R ESULTS  The systematic errors in a CTI instrument affect the spectral and spatial resolutions and locations in the reconstructed hyperspectral data cube in similar ways that these errors would affect the results of a traditional prism spectrograph This would be expected since the 3-D data is constructed from 2-D projection data.  The CTI becomes much more sensitive to error dependent on how the error kernel in the reconstruction behaves as a function of the prism rotation angle p and degree of freedom not in a fixed element dispersion system.  Four type s of systematic error were examined in this study; those due to tilt in the detector array  between the det ector array and the lens L 3  d   error in knowledge of the angular prism dispersion p    and error in estimation of the prism rotation angle p   s that can be inse rted into the error kernel functions were developed for each to model the effects For reasonably large array tilts of up to 3\260 and error in distance of up to 2mm, only a slightly noticeable shift of less than a pixel in spatial location was observed, mostly dependent on the tilt angle.  A more substantial spectral peak shift resulted which was due to error in distance, with a 7nm shift seen at the longer wavelengths at d  2mm.  The spatial and spectral resolu tions remained virtually unchanged, indicating that an accurate construction occurs in a shifted location The dispersion angle can be in error due to faulty estimation of prism performance.  This w ill cause an apparent shift of spectral peaks as shown in Figu re 8.  A more complicated  is the result of its dependence on the incident angle to the prism face I This is caused by mi salignment of the prism in the mount, or misalignment of the mount itself.  Mount misalignment is similar to cons tant error in estimation of p   with a shift in spectral p eaks observed.  For the AFIT CTI, this shift is only a few nm per 1\260 of misalignment Mount misalignment produces a more complex error kernel as shift and loss of resolutio n occur for relatively smaller angular errors.  More impor tantly, the spectral peaks become split into two peaks for errors of total misalignment in both the x and y directions of 1\260.  The spectral resolution may be recovered if the entire spatial area of the image is integrated.  However, simila r to splitting of peaks, the spatial distribution is a donut shape in the bin of emission  Finally, the error in projection angle p was examined though in a more obligatory fa shion since it is a relative error \(i.e. not a systematic erro r necessarily, but an error in choice of the reference coordinate system\.  There is no shifting of spectral peaks or lo ss of spectral resolution however there is a circular displacement of the spatial image again causing donut shap es for large enough   Most importantly, the error mode l was verified by collecting measured data from the AFIT CTI instrument with systematic error intentionally created in the instrument to assess the effect.  While in some cases it was apparent that sources of error other than those being investigated were influencing the results, the data did match the model for the situations where th e studied error effect was dominant usually at higher angular dispersi on, or spectral resolution Further investigation of some error may be necessary, as our CTI system design could only support a certain degree of component alteration to assess er ror.  In some cases, due to sampling of the detector array w ith respect to the size of the PSF of the system, slight changes in performance caused by error could not be resolved  4  C ONCLUSIONS  The purpose of this study wa s to assess the effect of systematic error on the reconstr ucted data sets collected by a rotating prism CTI instrument While the results are specific to the AFIT CTI desi gn, it is intended that the relative magnitude of each error and result on the reconstructed data will apply to any set of data given the general nature of the equations describing the reconstruction and error kernel that is con volved with each spectral bin  The consequence of each systematic error was quantified by the shift in spectral and/or spatial location, and degradation of spectral and/or spatial reso lution.  Table 2 summarizes the contribution of each analy zed error to these quantities   Table 2 \226The effect of systematic error.  An \223x\224 indicates an effect exists, a \223-\223 indicates no effect is observed   


  15 The model of the system allows for a quick assessment of the error, and provides a more illustrative demonstration of the prism misalignment error an d how each spectral peak is affected differently.  Figure 29 shows how the spectral peak changes as the prism mount alignment is increased in both the x and y directions for the 400nm and the 450nm spectral peaks   Figure 29 \226 The 400nm and 450nm peak shapes with varying misalignment of the prism mount   Similarly, Figure 30 represents the situation where the prism mount misalignment is constant at x  y 0.5\260 but the misalignment of the prism in the mount is changing so that a constant shape is produced, but shifted as x increases   Figure 30\226 Shifting of the 400nm spectral peak as x  increases.  The shape remains the same as the misalignment of the mount is constant   Though presented independently, the obvious contribution of the errors of the system are cumulative and must be considered in total.  Given th e great number of variations possible, this was not attempted here, but can be done based on the mathematics  This study is intended to explore the effect of systematic error for the purpose of examining sensitivity of performance when designing th e instrument.  In practice the reconstruction of collected data is done using after calibration of the instrument to directly measure r  p   without regard for the sources of error.  While this measurement can be a diagnostic of the instrument, the fact that it is well known is enough to perform acceptable reconstructions.  If instrume nt components are accessible the diagnostics be used to correct for second order error created in the instrument.  For example, errors in distance to the focal plane or tilt also result in a defocus error which cannot be easily recovered in the reconstruction algorithm R EFERENCES  1  C G r o s s, G  P.

South Korean versus American market  In terms of the effect of WOM, we find no discernable difference in the motion picture markets of South Korea and the United States. Volume of WOM is positively correlated to the following week?s revenue in both markets, and valence of WOM is not significant The effect of critical reviews, however, did not concur While the literature on the American market data reports that positive critical reviews are positively related to box office revenue[21, 34], the results on the Korean market was different. There could be several reasons for this. First, South Korea and the United States have different sources for critical reviews, and the sources may have different impacts on moviegoers Second, the characteristics of critics might be different i.e., Korean critics may prefer movies that are considered less commercial or artistic than American critics  5. Conclusion  WOM and critical reviews both are important attributes that influence box office revenue in the motion picture industry. In this study, six hypotheses related to this issue were set up and tested. Data was collected on the motion picture industry of South Korea by using several websites that provide content and statistical data about movies. Finally, data on 118 movies was collected and the movies were categorized into two groups based on the distributors of the movies If the distributor of a movie was one of the major distributors in South Korea, that movie was categorized into mainstream movies, and if not then the movie was categorized into non-mainstream movies. As expected mainstream movies had much higher box office revenue and volume of WOM than non-mainstream Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews 


movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews however, there was no big difference between mainstream and non-mainstream movies. WOM and critical reviews were usually positive H1 and H2 tested the relationship between WOM and weekly box office revenue, and the results supported the hypotheses. The volume of WOM was positively related to weekly box office revenue, while the valence of WOM had no significant effect. H3 H4a, and H4b tested the impact of critical reviews, and the results also supported the hypotheses except H4b The volume and valence of critical reviews had no consistent significances to weekly box office revenue H3 H4b. Table 7 showed that the number of critical reviews was statistically significant to aggregate box office revenue \(H4a for the attitude of critical reviews \(H4b the result more detail, an additional test was performed using only those factors related to critical reviews as independent variables. The result of the additional test supported H4, but the signs were reversed, i.e. positive critical reviews had minus signs, and negative critical reviews had plus signs. This reversed signs imply that the preference of critical reviewers is very similar to that of normal moviegoers. H5s and H6s tested the different effects of WOM and critical reviews on mainstream and non-mainstream movies. The result failed to determine that WOM give different impact on mainstream and non-mainstream movies, so H5a and H5b were rejected. H6, however, was supported, i.e the effects of critical reviews were different for mainstream and non-mainstream movies. There were no significant relationships between critical reviews and aggregate box office revenue in mainstream movies. For non-mainstream movies, however, the volume of critical reviews and the percentage of negative critical reviews were significant. Nonmainstream movies have fewer sources from which consumers can get information, and this might explain the results The above findings lead to several managerial implications. First, producers and distributors of movies could forecast weekly box office revenue by looking at previous weeks? volume of WOM. It does not matter what attitude people have when they spread WOM, the important factor is its volume. Therefore producers and distributors need to develop an appropriate strategy to manage WOM for their movies For example, the terms related to WOM marketing such as buzz and viral marketing are easily found Second, for the distributors who usually distribute less commercial and more artistic movies, and consequently have a smaller market compared to the major distributors, critical reviews can impact their movies box office revenues in a significant way. There are usually fewer sources for information for nonmainstream movies than mainstream movies, and so small efforts could leverage the outcomes. Finally, for those who are dealing with mainstream movies, the finding that the valence of WOM and critical reviews do not have significant relationship with box office revenue can have certain implications. Particularly, the attitude of critical reviews showed reversed effects Therefore, they may need to concentrate on other features rather than attitude of moviegoers or critical reviews, such as encouraging moviegoers to spread WOM This study contributes to the understanding of the motion picture industry, especially the relationship between box office revenue and WOM including critical reviews. There are existing studies that already 


critical reviews. There are existing studies that already dealt with similar issues, but this study has some differentiated features compare to prior studies. First the data used in this study was collected from South Korea, while most of the relevant studies usually focus on the North American market. This helps to provide the opportunity to understand the international market especially the Asian market, even though South Korea is a small part of it in terms of the motion picture industry. Second, movies were categorized to two groups, i.e. mainstream and non-mainstream and this study attempted to determine how WOM impacts these categories differently by testing several hypotheses In this study, there are also several limitations that could be dealt with in future research. First, using box office revenue as a dependent variable is more meaningful for distributers rather than producers. Due to there is close correlation between box office revenue and number of screens, one of producers? main concerns is how many screens their movies can be played on. Moreover, DVD sales are also important measurement for success of movies these days, and so it also could be a dependent variable. Therefore, it could be possible to give more fruitful managerial implications to various players in the motion picture industry by taking some other dependent variables Second, in this study, movies were categorized simply as mainstream and non-mainstream movies, but there could be further studies with diverse techniques of movie categorizations. For example, it would be possible to study the varying influence of WOM or critical reviews on different genres or movie budgets Third, an interesting finding of this study is that positive critical reviews could have negative relationship with box office revenue while negative critical reviews could have positive relationship.
