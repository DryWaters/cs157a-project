Stochastic\ngradient descent is a general technique to solve a large class\nof convex optimization problems and it is often been chosen\nto solve problems that deals with large data sets in particular.\nIn this work, we summarize the existing distributed solutions\nof LMF problem using stochastic gradient descent. We then\nproposed a novel distributed solution for LMF problem and our\nsolution is able to achieve the best convergence rate as well as\nfastest execution time when compared with existing solutions.\nWhen deployed in the cloud, our solution has the potential to\ndramatically reduce the cost of complex analytics over massive\ndatasets.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nMatrix Completion has been widely used in Recommender\nSystems [11]. In essential, matrix completion tries to infer the\nwhole original matrix while only given a partially observed\nmatrix. Low-rank Matrix Factorization \(LMF completion by trying to represent the observed\nmatrix as a product of two low-rank matrices with the mini-\nmum error. Then, in return, when the two low-rank matrices\nare multiplied together, the unobserved entries of the original\nmatrix are approximated by the product of corresponding row\nand column of the two low-rank matrices The resulting matrix\nof the product is taken as an inference of the original matrix.\nIn the age of Big Data the amount of data that matrix\ncompletion tasks are dealing with has exploded. Large network\ncompanies, such as Net?ix [3] and Yahoo! [8], have data\nthat contains user ratings of more than 100 millions and even\nbillions respectively. Net?ix is also running its entire service on\nAmazon EC2, a cloud service of Amazon, where the billing is\nbased on usage. Considering such a scale of the LMF problem\nit needs to deal with and the pay-as-you-go billing policy in the\ncloud, ef?cient distributed solver of LMF problem is eagerly\nneeded.\nResearchers have done quite a few work in running LMF\ntasks in parallel [12], [9], [14], [18 10]. Stochastic\nGradient Descent \(SGD great favor over other\nalgorithms by all these work due to several nice properties\nof it. First, SGD requires very cheap steps in updating the\nparameters so that the execution time of SGD scales linearly\nwith data size This is extremely useful when the amount of\ndata to be processed is huge. Other optimization algorithms\nwhich requires expensive \(in computation one or a\nfew data points to perform an update. This property allows\nSGD to be distributed executed over multiple cores or multiple\nmachines concurrently.\nCurrent solutions for distributed LMF can be categorized\ninto three categorise. The ?rst line of works focus on running\nshare-memory parallel SGD to solve LMF problems. [13]\nproves that when the given matrix is sparse, LMF can be ran\nparallel in a share-memory environment without any locks.\nFeng et al. [9] applies this method in to Bismarck, a framework\nfor running machine learning tasks inside databases. The\nsecond line of works [20], [14] solve LMF in a share-nothing\nenvironment. In this case, the data is ?rst partitioned into\nmultiple nodes. Then multiple SGDs are ran separately on\ndifferent partitions. In the end all the low-rank matrices from\ndifferent partitions are merged together. [20] runs LMF parallel\nin a MapReduce setting. [14] further pushes the same idea\nto the single node level in a distributed parallel database,\ni.e. running multiple SGDs even on a single node. The third\nline of works [10], [12], [18] try to separate the data in a\nway that the model \(two low-rank matrices can also be also\npartitioned accordingly in order to reduce data transmission. In\nthis case, each node only keeps a portion of the model and only\nconcatenating is needed when models from different nodes\ntogether are merged together. Different from the former two\nmethod, the third method exploits the special characteristics of\nLMF task and is therefore not applicable to other problems.\nThere are, however, different limitations of current solu-\ntions. The ?rst share-memory method needs the observation\nmatrix to be sparse to work. Otherwise locks need to be\napplied in order to guarantee convergence. Applying locks\nfails to scale with the data size when the concurrent updating\nincreases, because the possible contention will increase when\nevery thread \(or process two low-\nrank matrices contention\nproblem by having duplicates of models for different partitions\nof data. Each updating thread will have its own copy of the\nmodel and the updating will be performed only on its own\ncopy, so there is no updating contention. An overall model\n2013 International Conference on Cloud Computing and Big Data\n978-1-4799-2829-3 2013\nU.S. Government Work Not Protected by U.S. Copyright\nDOI 10.1109/CLOUDCOM-ASIA.2013.100\n52130 9 4\nis got be averaging all the copies of the model. Using the\nsecond 


method, [14] is able to push the computation to share-\nnothing environment with linear speed-up. But the problem\nof the second method is that it compromises the convergence\nrate by having the merges. In other words the more merges\nit has, the slower the overall problem converges. Moreover,\nthe second method has the same problem as the ?rst method\nin that the model it can run is limited by the memory size.\nEven wore, since the second method duplicates the model, it\nwill suffer more than the ?rst method when the model size\ngrows. The third method overpasses the memory problem by\npartitioning both the data and the model at the same time By\ntaking advantage of the special structure of LMF problem, the\nthird method is able to avoid the model averaging and only\nneeds model concatenating in the end. However, single node\nparallelism was not exploited enough so that it suffers from\nslow execution compared with the former two methods.\nIn this work, we seek to nd a solution that overcomes\nall limitations of current methods and has the fastest speed as\nwell as preserving the best convergence rate. In other words,\nour goal is to come up with an solutions satisfying following\nconditions. First, it should be a distributed method that can be\nran in a share-nothing cluster so that it does not limited by the\nnumber of cores as share-memory methods. Second, it should\nbe able to partition the model instead of to be limited by the\nmemory size to allow for running potentially large datasets.\nThird, it should be able to utilize all the resources it is given\nand push the execution speed to the maximum. Our speci?c\ncontributions are:\n• We summarize advantages and limitations of existing\nparallel LMF solutions in details.\n• We propose a novel distributed solutions for solving large-\nscale LMF problems by taking a nice combination of\nexisting solutions. We exam the technique details needed\nfor implementing our solution and discuss the difference\nbetween other solutions.\n• We run comparisons between existing solutions and our\nsolution over a 1 million by 1 million matrix with 1.7\nbillion non-zero entries over a 9-node cluster Our solution\nconverges fastest within 100 seconds. Moreover, when the\nmodel size grows larger, our solution is 2?4× faster than\nother solutions, i.e. our solution scales the best with larger\ntasks.\nThe implications of our solution has on big data analytics in\nthe cloud are dramatic. Given the pay-as-you-go billing policy\nin the cloud, our solution uses considerably less time compared\nother which results in a lot of economical bene?ts.\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows.\nWe explain the backgroud of low-rank matrix factorization\nproblem and standard stochastic gradient descent method in\nSection II. In Section III, we summarize the existing distributed\nand parallel solutions for LMF problems and their limitations.\nIn Section IV, we describe our solutions for distributed LMF\nproblem. In Section V, we demonstrate the ef?ciency and\nscalability of our solutions and show that we achieve a 2.5×\nspeed-up compared with the fastest distributed LMF solutions.\nThe related work is discussed in Section VI and we conclude\nour work in Section VII.\n\( Inception StarWars Avatar\nJay 1 ? 3\nAnna ? 4 5\nJohn 3 5 ?\n PRELIMINARIES\nIn this section, we explain how Low-rank Matrix Fac-\ntorization \(LMF systems and how\nstochastic gradient descent is used to solve LMF problem.\nA. Low-rank Matrix Factorization Problem\nWe take ”Net?ix Problem” as an example of LMF tasks.\nNet?ix is an on-line movie provider who wants to give\nrecommendations of movies based on users’ feedback \(ratings\nof movies from different users\ncan be represented as a matrix as shown in Figure 1. Each\nrow corresponds to one user and each column corresponds to\none movie. Users rate the movies by numbers from 1 to 5.\nApparently the rating matrix is not complete since only some\nof the users have rated some of the movies. The goal of a\nrecommender system is to predict the ’?’ in rating matrix to\nguess what is the rating a user might give based on his rating\nof other movies and other people’s rating of the same movie.\nFormally, let us assume there are m users and n movies.\nWe denote the m × n rating matrix as V . The goal of LMF\nis, given a small rank r where r rank\(V the original rating matrix V by\nthe product of two low-rank matrices—L and R. To evaluate\nhow good the approximation is, we have the basic squared loss\nfunction f :\nf\(L,R i,j V ij ?Li?R?j 1 is all the non-zero entries in V , i.e. the training\nset. There is usually a regularization term added to the loss\nfunction \(1  function without\nany regularization term since any regularization can be applied\nto the loss function and the training process by stochastic\ngradient descent will be still the same.\nGiven the loss function \(1 of LMF is to ?nd two\nmatrices L? and R?, such that:\n\(L?,R L,R 2 available solve the above optimiza-\ntion problem. But when it comes to large data sets, stochastic\ngradient descent generally outperforms other methods in high\nruntime performance which results in fast convergence in real\ntime.\n522\nB. Gradient Methods\nConsider the following optimization problem with a de-\ncomposable objective function \(i.e. summation w, zi w 3 has to be\nfound such that the objective function is minimized. The con-\nstants zi, 1 ? i ? N correspond to 


tuples in a database table—\nmaterialized or obtained as the result of a query. Essentially,\neach term in the objective function corresponding to a tuple\nzi can be viewed as a separate function fi\(w w zi 3 an\narbitrary vector w\(0 k+1 at each iteration\ndecreases, i.e., f\(w\(k+1 w\(k we consider P \(w gradient decent guarantees the\ndecrease is by taking the opposite direction of current gradient\nwhich formally can be written as:\nw\(k+1 k nw\(k 4 w\(k current\ngradient of function f at w\(k SGD differs from standard gradient descent in that\ninstead of computing the exact gradient ?f\(w\(k iteration\nk, SGD takes ?fi\(w\(k w\(k w\(k updates of w is:\nw\(k+1 k k nw\(k 5 instead\nof the actual gradient is the characteristic property of SGD.\nTypically, ?k ? 0 as k ? ? and ?\(k 1, . . . , N} repre-\nsents a random permutation, i.e., all fi have to be considered\nbefore any term is repeated.\nHow can we determine when the method converges? And\nhow do we know that the method converges to a global\nminimum of the objective function? The standard method to\ncheck for convergence is to compare the objective function\nfor w\(k+1 k given threshold, convergence can\nbe assumed. An alternative is to ?x the number of iterations\nahead of time and take the last w as the optimal solution.\nConvergence to a global optimal solution is theoretically\nguaranteed when the functions\n?N\ni=1 fi\(w updates only need\none or a few data points which is much cheaper than gradient\ndescent which needs to go through the whole dataset to do\none update. Though the updates of SGD is noisy, it converges\nmuch faster in time when the current position is far away\nfrom the optimal [4]. This is extremely helpful when dealing\nwith huge data size since the update gets even more expensive\n\(computationally that SGD\nalready converges while standard gradient descent has not even\n?nished one update.\nThe loss function of LMF satis?es the characteristics of\nobjective function \(3 Li?,R?j function \(1 when P \(w w each\nupdate in \(5 w 4].\nIII. PARALLEL STOCHASTIC GRADIENT DESCENT FOR\nLOW-RANK MATRIX FACTORIZATION\nConsidering that SGD only requires one or a few tuples\nfor each update, the model updating of SGD is potentially\nparallelizable by itself. Moreover, LMF problem contains\ncertain structure that allows for even more parallelism. In this\nsection, we explore the special structure of LMF problem and\nsummarize the existing parallel solutions for LMF.\nA. Share-memory LMF\nAccording to equation \(1 updated. Which means all the Li?? \(i? \n=\ni j \n= j nTherefore, updating of V ij and V kl\(i \n= k and j \n= l to keep the model \(L and\nR 15]. Finer grain locks can be\napplied to speci?c rows and columns that are been updated,\nthus allows for parallel updating of the rows and columns as\nlong as they do not overlap. Hogwild! [13] proves that when\nthe matrix V is sparse, it does not even need to lock on\nrows and columns. Allowing contention can also provide good\nenough convergence rate in the sparse case.\nThe number of parallelism of share-memory updating,\nhowever is limited by the number of cores that one node has.\nEven if there are more cores available, having more cores will\nincrease the possibility of updating contention waiting which\ncompromises the execution time. Moreover share-memory\nLMF requires the model to be ?t in memory, so it fails to\nsupport the case when the model size exceeds the memory\nsize.\nB. Distributed LMF\nDistributed SGD is an alternative to overpass the updating\ncontention problem of share-memory. We summarize two\nexisting distributed solutions for LMF—model averaging and\nmodel concatenating.\n1  randomly partitioning the data into\ndifferent nodes and running multiple SGDs distributed on each\ndata partitions. The number of parallelism of model averaging\nequals to the number of data partitions, i.e. the number of\nnodes. When all the data partition ?nish updating, an overall\nmodel is generated by averaging all the models from different\npartitions. The averaging operation is a weighted averaging\nfor each and every dimension of the model and the weight\nis the portion of data each partition contains. [14] pushes the\nparallelism of model averaging inside each node by further\n523\ndividing each data partition into chunks and scheduling the\nchunks to multiple updating threads within one node. [14]\nachieves linear speed-up in terms of cores until hitting the\nIO-bound of the physical disks and therefore it is the state-of-\nthe-art in terms 


of single iteration execution time.\nModel averaging LMF solves the updating contention\nproblem by keeping copies of models in memory. Considering\nmodel it even keeps multiple model within one node, it\nmemory limitation of model averaging LMF is higher than\nshare-memory LMF. Also, the averaging operation introduces\nvariation of the model which hurts the convergence rate in\nterms of number of epochs needed to converge. In other words,\nmodel averaging LMF takes more epochs to converge to the\nsame value as share-memory But since model averaging can be\nsigni?cantly faster in epoch execution time, it is still achieves\nfaster convergence rate in terms of real time.\n2  averaging operation in model averaging by parti-\ntioning the data into interchangeable sets instead of random\nsets. We take the de?nition of interchangeable set from [10]:\nDe?nition 1. Two training points z1, z2 Z \(Z is training\nthe set 3 for any w, and ? > 0,\nf ?z1\(w w ? ?f ?z2\(w w w ? ?f ?z1\(w 6 Two disjoint sets of training points Z1, Z2 ?\nZ are interchangeable with respect to f if z1 and z2 are\ninterchangeable for every z1 ? Z1 and z2 ? Z2 with respect\nto f .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 2: interchangeable sets and their corresponding model\npartitions\nBy partitioning data into interchangeable sets, model con-\ncatenating is able to partition the model accordingly. As shown\nin Figure 2, since V1, V2 and V3 are three interchangeable\nsets each of which only updates an non-overlapped portion\nof model \(L and R the model can also be partitioned\ninto L1 ? L3, R1 ? R3 according. The advantages of\npartitioning interchangeable sets are as follows. First, from\nthe de?nition we know that the order in which interchangeable\nsets are processed does not change the convergence of original\nproblem. Thus V1, V2, and V3 can be processed concurrently\nwithout affecting the convergence rate. Second, only model\nconcatenation needs to be performed when merging models\nfrom different interchangeable sets. This avoids the harmful\naveraging operation as in model averaging LMF. Last, being\nable to also partition the model gives lose the memory limi-\ntation of the size of model that one can run. This is a critical\nadvantage especially in the Big Data era where datasets are\nexploding. Notice that a group of interchangeable sets take up\nonly a portion of matrix V , multiple sub-epochs over different\ninterchangeable sets are needed to ran to fully cover the whole\nmatrix V .\nThe parallelism of model concatenating comes from the\nconcurrent processing of interchangeable sets. So the number\nof parallelism comes with the number of interchangeable sets\none can get. The limitation of model concatenating is that to\nachieve higher parallelism, a lot of partitions need to be done.\nUnlike model averaging where the partition is random, ?ner\ngranularity structural partition will incur unbalance workload.\nIn other word, different interchangeable sizes will end of with\nvery different size. This causes long waiting time between sub-\nepochs since nodes are waiting each other for the correspond-\ning portion of model.\n[18] alleviates the waiting between sub-epochs by further\npartition each data portion into two parts In essential, this is a\npipeline mechanism where one part of model is being sent to\nother nodes when the other part is getting updated. As shown\nin Figure 3, when partition V11 ?nishes on node1, instead of\nalso waiting V12 to ?nish it sends R11 directly to node2 while\nV12 is still executing. Utilizing the pipeline mechanism solves\nthe waiting problem of model concatenating but it still suffers\nlow speed-up considering the number of cores available for\neach node. [18] also only aims for in-memory LMF.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\b\n\n\b\n\n\b\n\n\n n\n\t\n\n\n\n\f\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\f\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\f\n\nFig. 3: pipeline mechanism within each partition\nIV. TURBO DISTRIBUTED LMF\nIn this section, we propose Turbo Distributed LMF \(TD-\nLMF large-scale\nLMF problem. TD-LMF achieves the fastest computation\nspeed possible as well as preserving the highest convergence\nrates. TD-LMF’s advantages over existing solutions are sum-\nmarized as follows:\n• Unlike single node share-memory LMF, TD-LMF is a\ndistributed solution which can be scaled out to the a large\nnumber of nodes in the cloud.\n524\n• TD-LMF is able to partition the model so that it is not\nlimited by the memory size as model averaging LMF\nmethods.\n• TD-LMF adopts the notion of interchangeable sets which\ndoes not incur any penalty on loss while merging models\nfrom different data partitions together.\n• The parallelism of TD-LMF is not limited by the number\nof partitions as model concatenating LMF methods are.\nTD-LMF fully utilizes the cores available in each node\nto speed-up the execution. TD-LMF is able to beat the\nfastest distributed LMF in per epoch execution time. The\ndominance is even more and more obvious when the\nmodel size grows larger and larger.\n• Different from in-memory methods, TD-LMF reads data\nfrom the disks thus imposing no limit on number of nodes\nshould be ran in order to keep all the training data in\nmemory.\nIn a nutshell, TD-LMF follows the data partition of\nmodel concatenating LMF at cluster-level and performs share-\nmemory updating at node-level Models are concatenated\ntogether after each iteration. In the following sections, we\ndescribe what techniques are used in TD-LMF to accomplish\nits amazing performance.\nA. Data & Model Partition\nThe data partition in 


TD-LMF is done randomly column-\nwise. Each node gets the same number of random columns\nfrom the training data In such a large granularity, the partitions\nare less likely to be unbalanced. So generally each and every\nnode gets the same workload from this cluster-level data\npartition. The data in each partition is further divided randomly\nrow-wise into blocks. The number of blocks equals to the\nnumber of nodes in the cluster. Note that after the data\npartition, rows and columns can be re-name to natural number\nsince there is no order in the training matrix anyway. An\nexample of 3 node data partition is shown is shown in Figure 4.\nThe right side of Figure 4 shows the blocks on each node after\nre-naming the row and column numbers. Thus, two blocks that\ndo not share any rows and columns are interchangeable sets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\b n\b n\b nFig. 4: Data partition and sub-epoch scheduling.\nAfter the data is partitioned as above, the model can also\nbe partitioned accordingly as shown in Figure 2. Thus each\nnode only needs to store part of the model which allows for\nhuge tasks where the model does not ?t into the memory of\none node.\nB. Sub-epoch Scheduling\nOne epoch \(iteration processes one block of\ntraining data from the partition. The execution of sub-epoch\nover different nodes is fully parallelized on interchangeable\nsets. The number of sub-epochs equals to the number of blocks\non each nodes. Figure 4 shows the sub-epoch scheduling of\nTD-LMF, the blocks in the same color are interchangeable sets\nand are thus in the same sub-epoch, e.g. V11, V22, V33 are in\nsame sub-epoch. There are three sub-epochs in this case.\nC. Share-memory Update\nWhen one block is processed during a sub-epochs, share-\nmemory updating is used within each node. This share-\nmemory updating differs from share-memory LMF in that in-\nstead of linearly scanning through the training data and having\ntuple-level parallelism, share-memory updating in TD-LMF\nparallelize the update in chunk level. A chunk is nothing but\na branch of tuples \(training data points and a block contains\nmultiple chunks. Multiple chunks are processed concurrently\nin TD-LMF and this allows for reducing contention which we\nwill explain in the following section IV-D.\nTo further speed up the TD-LMF instead of using mutexes,\nwe use CompareAndSwap atomic instruction to lock only on\nthe rows and columns that are being updated.\nD. Reducing Contention\nTo reduce the contention of share-memory updating during\na sub-epoch, the training data is sorted by the coordinates\nwithin each node partition. In essential, the intuition of sorting\nthe data is to put the points which are more likely to have\ncontention together. And then serially process these contention\npoints. This kind of assembled contention unit is a chunk\nin TD-LMF. Since the parallelism comes from concurrent\nprocessing of multiple chunks, the contention across chunks is\nminimized. Note that we still preserve tuple-level randomiza-\ntion and chunk-level randomization to ensure the SGD is per-\nformed in a random way across iterations. The randomization\nis guaranteed by random shuf?e the chunks and tuples within\none chunk while processing. Details about the randomization\nin can be found in 14].\nE. Model Transmission\nSince the model is partitioned during each sub-epoch,\nmodel transmission is needed at the end of each sub-epoch\nto allow other nodes to work on the same portion of model\nin turns. In TD-LMF model transmission is done by node-to-\nnode communication since there is no cluster-level synchro-\nnization needed.\nV. EMPIRICAL EVALUATION\nIn this section, we presents how TD-LMF is implemented\nin GLADE, a distributed parallel database. We evaluate the\nef?ciency and scalability of TD-LMF on large dataset. To\nshow comparisons we implement model averaging, model\nconcatenating, and TD-LMF in GLADE and we test these\nsolutions by a large dataset. For ef?ciency, we measure the per-\nepoch execution time of all these methods. To test scalability,\n525\nwe run LMF with different ranks to see how well every\nmethods scale with the model size.\nA Implementation\nGLADE: We implement TD-LMF in GLADE. GLADE\nis a parallel data processing system executing any computa-\ntion speci?ed as a Generalized Linear Aggregate \(GLA  by a push-based\nstorage manager that drives the execution. Essentially, GLADE\nprovides an infrastructure abstraction for parallel processing\nthat decouples the algorithm from the runtime execution. The\nalgorithm has to be speci?ed in terms of a clean interface,\nwhile the runtime takes care of all the execution details includ-\ning data management, memory management, and scheduling.\nContrary to existent parallel data processing systems designed\nfor a target architecture, typically shared-nothing, GLADE is\narchitecture-independent. GLADE hits the physical limitations\nboth on shared-disk servers as well as on shared-nothing\nclusters—see [16] for experimental evidence. The reason for\nthis is the exclusive use of thread-level parallelism inside a\nprocessing node while process-level parallelism is used only\nacross nodes. There is no difference between these two in the\nGLADE infrastructure abstraction.\n\t\n\f\n\n\n\n\b\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\b\t 


34. Motivation refers to the Internal and \nexternal factors that stimulate desire and energy to be \nactively involved in social network activities. \nMotivation is categorized into \(i nSDT\(Self-Determination Theory  ii that a user is \nactively involved in. \nThe widely accepted topic detection algorithm is \nLDA\(Latent Dirichlet Allocation   networks, hypergraph [5] \nor multi-mode network [37] is commonly used. However, in \nthese works, only uni-dimensional features of the users, \ncategories, and posts are considered, therefore it dramatically nlimits the breadth and depth of the analytics in social \nnetworks. Based on these considerations, we improve the \nhyper graph model with the capacity of conducting multi-\ndimensional analyses. \nA. Hyper Graph Representation of Social Networks \nBehavior \nBefore we proceed to discuss the hyper graph \nrepresentation social network behaviors, let us first introduce \nthe denotation of the social network behaviors. As discussed nin Section 2, the properties of social network users, \ncategories and tweets are not uni-dimensional, as shown in \nFig. 2a. Suppose the set of vertices in social networks is \nrepresented as V and its three subsets as U = {u1,...,uk}, C = \n{c1,...,cl}, T = {t1,...,tm}, corresponding to the set of users, the \nset of categories/topics marked by hash tag subsets \nare disjoint and possibly empty. Then the dimensions of each \nof three type vertices are denoted as P\(uk uk u cm cm c tl tl PTj3, j3 = 1, ..., |P\(t j3th \ndimension of user type, category type and tweet type vertex. \nThe behavior in social networks is then defined as a \ntripartite graph H\(B u, c, t U×C×T} represents the \nhyperedge. For example, in twitter case, each edge represents \nthe fact that a given user participated in the disseminating of \na tweet marked within a certain category. The dissemination \nways of tweets include DT, RT, and MT.  \nFigure 2.  \(a B u1, u2, u3 t1, t2}, E={{u1, t1, c1}, {u2, t2, c1},{u3, t1, c1}} \n65\nIn Fig. 2b, u1 directly sends a tweet t1 hash tagged c1, \nthen u2 sends t2 under the same category, u3 retweets t1, \nsuppose u3 modified retweet t1, adding another category c2, \nthen hyperedge e4 should be added.  \nB. Multi-faceted Behavior based Analytics \nThe tripartite graphs and hyperedges can be reduced to \nthree bipartite graphs with regular edges. These three graphs \nmodel the associations between users and categories \(graph \nUC graph CT n\(graph UT u, c u, c t u, c e u,c,tk u, c, tk graph into its one-\nmode networks can be easily obtained through the matrix O \n= {oij}, oij = f\(u,c,tk bipartite graph [5]. In the uni-\ndimensional fashion, oij = 1 indicates user ui disseminates a \ntweet marked with category cj. In the multi-dimensional \nfashion, suppose sentiment is also under consideration, oij navg\(s\(tk k = 1, .. ,K with category \ncj that user ui disseminates. The co-a?liation matrix P = \nOO’= {pij}, where pij = ?oixoxj x=1, ..k matrix describes the relations \nbetween two users who have both participated in \ndisseminating tweets within the same category, with the \nsentiments in the posts considered simultaneously. While in \nthe matrix without considering sentiment, the links are \nbetween people who have used the same categories with \nweights showing the number of categories they have used in \ncommon. Here, these are also weighted by the sentiments. In \nthe general notation, oij = avg\(?pj3\(tk one-mode \nnetwork matrices indicates the counts of how many \ncategories a given user was a?liated with in the bipartite \ngraph; in multi-dimensional conditions, the diagonal \nindicates the average sentiments of the user tweets in the \ncategories.

In particular, the CT \ngraph leads to another semantic network, where the links \nbetween categories are weighted by integrating the quantity \nof tweets that are tagged with both terms and the properties \nof the senders of the tweets. The UT graph results in another \nrelation network of persons, where the weight of a pair is \ngiven by integrating the number of tweets they have both \ndisseminated and the properties of the categories of the \ntweets. Two networks of tweets can also be obtained from \nUT and CT. \nIV. CASE STUDY IN TWITTER \nIn this section, we aim to illustrate the applicability of the \nimproved hypergraph model from the perspective of how it \ncould enhance the breadth” of social network analytics by \napplying it to unearth the hidden multi-dimensional \nrelationships 


of the highly active Twitter users. \nA. Data Description \nThe tweets were obtained from January ~ October 2010. \nThe sentiment of the tweets are evaluated based on ANEW \n[20] with emoticons and slangs replaced with the \ncorresponding text. The data used for replacing emoticons \nand slangs are emoticons [38], containing 938\(1341  ANEW only concerns \nEnglish words, non-English users were filtered out by \nconsidering two aspects concurrently: \(i ii the threshold is set at 0.3 for segmenting between \nnon-English and English users nextracted: \(i ii disseminated the posts \n\(both DT and RT After the preprocessing, we \nhave 81 users, 6,711categories and 3, 887, 363 tweets. \nB. Multi-dimensional User Relationship Analytics \nFig. 3 gives a fine grain view of the whole user \nconnections in Twitter as an illustration of multi-faceted user \nrelation analyses. In Fig. 3, the color of the nodes indicates \nthe degree of users, while the edge color indicates the weight \nof edges, in \(a d spread \nin the same category, \(b c d though two users have co-\nused the same category, the connection between them varies \nalong different dimensions. In this way, in addition to simply \nknowing there is a common category-mark behavior between \ntwo users, the properties of this behavior could also be \nunearthed and reflected in the strength of the user nconnections. Thus not only the volume is dramatically \ncompressed through the knowledge extraction, but also the \ncomplexity of big data is dis-entangled in a finer resolution \nfor the analysts and decision makers. \n n\(a b c d A fine grain view of two user connections based on the \ncategories co-used and  \(a co-spread with \(b c d a d Red-\nBlue: Greatest-\nSmallest a d a b n\(c d Red-\nBlue: Greatest-\nSmallest a tweets co-spread, \n\(b c d FUTURE WORK \nIn this paper we present a multi-layered knowledge \nextraction approach of social networks with a comprehensive \nsurvey of relevant notions and techniques from multi-\ndisciplines. Besides, we also improve the hyper graph model \nof social network behaviors based on the dimensions \nproposed in the model with a case study in Twitter \nillustrating the multi-dimensional relations between Twitter \nusers.

[24]\nimplements a OS-level scheduler which places intensively-\ninteracting threads close to each other. As shown in this\npaper, arranging data movement based on cache topology\nalone does not capture all important trade-offs and may lead\nto sub-optimal overall performance.\nContention Aware Mapping.

Hardware [21] and OS level [17]\ncache partitioning, user level thread scheduling [34], and\ncompiler-time transformation [22, 25 are proposed to mit-\nigate resource contention among processes and/or threads.\nHowever, they only work for independent threads or pro-\ncesses with no communication or sharing relationships.\nHolistic Mapping. [26 exploits thread mapping for op-\ntimizing multi-threaded datacenter applications on CMPs.\nHowever, the mapping policies in [26] either use exhaustive\nsearch or require a new algorithm for each type of cache\ntopology. Our new contributions include an in-depth study\nof streaming application’s cache behavior and a holistic\nmapping algorithm which is more general and scalable.\nB. Optimizing Streaming Applications on CMPs\nAlgorithmic Optimization of Streaming Algorithms. Exam-\nples include join [27, 11], aggregation [6], sorting [10 and\nfrequency counting [7]. Operators in a streaming program\nmay interact with each other in complicated ways and\nsuch complexity is manifested at thread level at runtime.\nManaging such complicated interaction is beyond the scope\nof tuning individual operators, so orchastration provided by\nStreamMap is necessary to coordinate threads’ execution.\nBesides, StreamMap does not require knowledge of opera-\ntors’ internal implementation, and uses pro?ling information\ncollected at middleware level to make mapping decisions.\nTherefore, StreamMap is orthogonal and complementary to\ncode tuning of individual streaming operators.\nCompile-Time Scheduling and Mapping of Streaming Pro-\ngrams on CMPs. Pioneered by StreamIt [13], work has\nbeen done in optimizing static scheduling of streaming\nprograms on multicores [16, 29, 30]. Those work apply\ncompiler analysis and code transformation to exploit various\nparallelism in program to balance computation load among\nthreads. Since most of those work target Cell B.E. architec-\n630\nture which has explicitly managed memory hierarchy, they\ncommonly try to hide data movement cost by overlapping\ncommunication with computation in the execution schedule.\nIn comparison, StreamMap targets cache topologies seen in\nx86 CMP architecture which impose distinct challenges such\nas contention on shared resources, and it works at thread\nlevel without heroic compiler analysis.\nCache-Aware Optimization of Streaming Programs. [23]\nproposed three techniques to optimize StreamIt programs\non a uniprocessor: execution scaling, buffer manager, and\nregister replacement. [20] extends execution scaling to multi-\ncore. Both work assumes synchronous data ?ow model to\ncalculate static steady state schedule, and [20] does not\nconsider thread mapping to reduce contention or thread\nsynchronization cost 4] theoretically shows that cache-\nef?cient scheduling of streaming programs on a uniprocessor\ncan be modeled as a partitioning problem and some special\ncases can be solved in polynomial time. Our work targets\nmulti-core processors, uses mapping algorithms different\nfrom the one proposed in [4], implements those algorithms\ninside System S middleware, and evaluates them with real-\nworld applications on representative architectures.\nVII CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK\nThis paper demonstrates that CMP’s cache topology can\nhave a signi?cant impact on the performance of multi-\nthreaded streaming applications. Our StreamMap approach\nautomatically places threads 


to cores to control the data\nsharing and resource contention between threads, and can\nimprove real-world streaming applications’ performance by\nup to 1.8 times over the default Linux OS scheduler.\nFuture directions of this research are twofold. We plan to\nstudy how to use StreamMap to provide feedback informa-\ntion to System S’ compiler to optimize operator fusion. We\nalso plan to apply StreamMap to a wider range of streaming\napplications, e.g., dynamic graph analysis.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Dynamorio: Dynamic instrumentation tool platform.\nhttp://www.dynamorio.org, October 2012.\n[2] Likwid: Lightweight performance tools.\nhttp://code.google.com/p/likwid, October 2012.\n[3] Scotch: Static mapping, graph, mesh and hypergraph partitioning.\nhttp://www.labri.fr/perso/pelegrin/scotch/, October 2012.\n[4] K.

Some are acted upon immedi-\nately, but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions -- our implicit "label-\ning" of the world. In this talk I will describe our work using physiological correlates of this labeling to con-\nstruct a hybrid brain-computer interface \(hBCI record electroencephalographic \(EEG part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate \nthe neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective inter-\nest. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using nsemi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to those that are labelled. \nFinally, the system plots an efficient route so that subjects visit similar objects of interest. We show that by \nexploiting the subjects' implicit labeling, the median search precision is increased from 25% to 97%, and the \nmedian subject need only travel 40% of the distance to see 84% of the objects of interest. We also find that \nthe neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers inference of subjects' \nimplicit labeling. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of ob-\njects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting \nin an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user's interests. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Paul Sajda is Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Radiol-\nogy at Columbia University and Director of the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing \n\(LIINC modeling and \nmachine learning applied to image understanding.

That has necessitated the challenge of con-\ntrolling the limb with such superior dexterity.  I will introduce methods for dexterous nprosthesis control, from myoelectric to cortical \(EEG, Electrocorticogram, neural \nspike, local field potential incorporating multimodal sensors, such as camera and video tracking, may lead to more functional \nand practical prosthesis control. Emerging challenge now is to make the revolutionary prosthetics, practi-\ncal affordable and available for amputees today.

White \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Are Our Cellular Models Fundamentally Wrong? \n \nAbstract: The Hodgkin-Huxley model, arguably the greatest success story in the history \nof computational neuroscience, is the predecessor of thousands of existing cellular models \nthat span a significant range of levels of detail. Here, using electrophysiological, dynamic-\nclamp, and computational techniques, we demonstrate that many of the “gold standard” \nsingle-cell models, used by thousands of laboratories, fail to account correctly for the responses of well-studied \nexcitatory neurons to noise.  In particular, the input-output gain of entorhinal stellate cells and neocortical py-\nramidal cells is substantially less sensitive to noise than predicted by the models.  The major source of the dis-\ncrepancy is that the models fit measured peri-threshold voltage dynamics poorly.  Because noise is ubiquitous \nand prominent in the brain, and because neuronal gain is crucial for understanding a wide range of response nproperties at the cellular and network levels, we argue that this is an issue of fundamental importance. \n nBiographical Sketch:  John A.

Despite spending as little as 0.01% of their lives having seizures, people \nwith epilepsy take antiepileptic drugs \(AEDs ex-\nperience significant AED related side effects, and approximately 1/3 continue to have seizures. Mapping the \nbrain networks generating seizures is critical for successful epilepsy surgery, therapeutic brain stimulation, \nand seizure forecasting. In focal epilepsy the spontaneous, evoked, and induced brain activity is disrupted \nover a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. Multiscale electrophysiology recordings have uncovered a range \nof electrophysiological biomarkers, measurable interictal \(between seizures normal and \npathological tissue that show promise for spatiotemporal mapping of epileptogenic brain. In this talk we \nreview two potential applications of these multiscale biomarkers, epilepsy surgery and seizure forecasting.  \n \n Biographical Sketch:  Greg Worrell, MD, PhD is Chair of Clinical Neurophysiology, Director of Mayo Sys-\ntems Electrophysiology Laboratory \(MSEL prac-\ntice and research are focused on the evaluation and care of patients with medically resistant epilepsy nThrough MSEL he is currently pursuing the integration of large-scale neurophysiology, computing, and im-\naging for biomarker discovery.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual

Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
