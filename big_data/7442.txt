ddressing the scienti\037c grand challenges identi 037ed by the US Department of Energy \(DOE O\036ce of Science programs alone demands a to tal leadership-class computing capability of 150 to 400 P\035ops by the end of this decade. \034e successors to DOE\222s three most powerful leadership-class machines 
are set to arrive in 2017 and 2018\227the products of the Collaboration Oak Ridge Argonne Livermore \(CORAL initiative, a national laboratory\226industry design/build ap proach to engineering next-generation petascale computers for grand challenge science. \034ese mission-critical ma chines will enable discoveries in key scienti\037c \037elds such as energy, biotechnology, nanotechnology, materials sci 
ence, and high-performance computing and will serve as a milestone on the path to deploying exascale computing capabilities 
Since 2012, three US DOE supercomputers\227two that sup port open scienti\037c research and one focused primarily on nuclear security\227have been among the top \037ve fastest ma chines in the world. Each has followed a familiar life cycle 
Meeting a Need 
a debut on the international  supercomputing scene followed by years of robust use before eventually meeting their limits in the face of increasing demand Such is the fate of machines whose capabilities represent the \223highest domestic priority\224 with respect to DOE mis sion needs 034e US faces serious economic, environmental, and na tional security challenges based on its dependence on fossil fuels and the need to be energy independent. \034ese machines

64   July/August 2015 Ridge National Laboratory and at the DOE\222s Na tional Nuclear Security Administration\222s laboratory Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, are the computational engines that are helping research ers across a broad range of disciplines look for new alternative energy sources and develop new energy technologies Teams of technicians, performance engineers domain scientists, and computational scientists are needed to prepare these behemoths to e\033ectively and e\036ciently execute the massive computations driving high-end simulation science and modeling From day one, the petascale capabilities of these machines are maximized: jobs run round the clock throughout the year Research teams are given time \(typically tens of millions of hours, or core-hours\o investigate many of the fundamental questions in science to day\227to capture new opportunities in combustion science, battery technology, materials science, and fusion energy. What these teams can look for and learn is limited only by the machine\222s physical ca pabilities, power constraints, and contention for a shared resource Maintaining US leadership in computational sci ence and engineering requires the best  resources\227 including a succession of computers with world-class speed and capability. All the major priorities highlighted in the DOE\222s 2014 strategic plan\227preparing for climate change, securing our leadership in clean energy technologies, maintain ing science and engineering as a cornerstone of our economic prosperity, and enhancing our nuclear security\227depend critically on advanced comput ing and have sharply focused the mission need for leadership-computing facilities Increasing the supercomputing capability to hundreds of peta\035ops, a process now under way, is vital to the US achieving its goals\227and to achieving exascale computing down the road 034ese pre-exascale systems will be many times more powerful than their predecessors, they\222ll be diverse \(providing two distinct solutions and they\222ll be deployed and operational within a 2017\2262018 timeframe 034ese new supercomputers are the outcome of the CORAL partnership, formed in early 2014 to simplify and streamline the processes to procure for each lab a radically more powerful and archi tecturally diverse pre-exascale system, with the long term goal of delivering exascale systems that will be 20 to 40 times faster than today\222s leading supercomputers CORAL aggregated the expertise of three na tional labs to de\037ne the ideal system requirements for their users\227the scienti\037c community\227and then provided multiple large-machine awards as an incentive to industry to align their business plans to design and develop systems to meet these needs CORAL issued a single request for proposals for multiple laboratory acquisitions where the win ning bids would both deliver and support the new architecture. In this way, vendors would have a large stake in the success of these pre-exascale ma chines, and the CORAL partners could encourage and fund applied research to \037nd a speci\037c solution to meet a speci\037c need that could be hardened as a deliverable 034e CORAL partnership selected two mul tivendor bids: IBM/Nvidia/Mellanox and In tel/Cray. Oak Ridge and Lawrence Livermore announced their private-sector partners last fall Computer manufacturer IBM, along with Open POWER Foundation partners Nvidia and Mel lanox, would build two separate machines using a heterogeneous architecture, or one that couples central processing units \(CPUs\ith general-pur pose graphics processing units \(GPUs 034e Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facil ity\222s \(OLCF\222s\Summit, the IBM machine sched uled to arrive in 2017, will deliver more than \037ve times the computational performance of Titan\222s 18,688 nodes, while using roughly 3,400 nodes Summit\222s architecture will consist of nodes with multiple IBM POWER9 CPUs and Nvidia Volta GPU accelerators, using a coherent memory space that includes high-bandwidth memory on the GPUs and a high-speed NVLink interconnect be tween the POWER9 CPU and Volta GPUs.

It will be based on the third-generation Xeon Phi family of chips from Intel 034e new system, Aurora, is scheduled to ar rive in 2018 and will be built using these advanced processors, second-generation Intel Omni-Path Ar chitecture interconnect technology, a new memory architecture, and a Lustre-based parallel \037le sys tem\227all integrated by Cray\222s high-performance

Even as these next-generation machines are being rolled out, DOE has started planning the evolution of its leadership-computing capabilities for the next decade To ensure that, starting from day one, the capa bility of a leadership machine is su\036cient to meet the scienti\037c challenges that it will eventually support, the Leadership Computing Facility cen ters run separate programs that provide training and code support to a small number of project teams and then turn them loose on the machines 034ese Early Science Program projects \(science  application codes\epresent a large portion of the machines\222 current and projected computational workloads OLCF\222s Center for Accelerated Applica tion Readiness \(CAAR\ently working with 13 partnership teams to refactor and port their codes for Summit.
