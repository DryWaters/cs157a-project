Consequently, in-situ diagnostics for state-ofhealth estimation of the battery is also critical for enhancing the overall applications\222 reliability. Montana Tech, in collaboration with the Idaho National Laboratory \(INL\and Qualtech Systems Inc. \(QSI has been working towards the development of advanced techniques for in-situ and real time estimation of a battery\222s impedance spectrum. INL has 
shown that the shift of a batteries impedance spectrum strongly correlates to the health of the battery   Two different methods for measurement of the battery impedance spectrum have been developed independently by Montana Tech, INL, and QSI  INL has developed an in-situ system, the Impedance Noise Identification \(INI method of using a random signal excitation to a battery for the purpose of measuring the spectrum of the battery impedance; it is high resolution but not real time.  Montana Tech and QSI developed an in-situ system, Compensated 
Synchronous Detection \(CSD t h at i s very near real  t i m e but trades off resolution for speed of measurement. New developments with CSD hold promise of an even faster and more accurate response. A new measurement and data processing technique has been developed, Fast Summation Transformation \(FST The FST t echni que uses a mathematical uniqueness similar to what was realized with the Fast Fourier Transform FFT\to enable crosstalk elimination, speed of measur ement, and speed of data processing. A prototype hardware system that is compatible with both the INI or CSD algorithms is now under development. Test results are continuously being compared 
to standardized measurement techniques such as electrochemical impedance spectro scopy. It is expected that the FST algorithm will be fully compatible with this hardware platform. This paper develops the theory of the algorithm and analytically validates it with computer simulations. It also provides preliminary testing results of the FST implementation on the CSD hardware platform   T ABLE OF C ONTENTS  1  I NTRODUCTION

002 002  10  Where N is the number of samples over the period  We now verify that these sine and cosine rectification functions preserve orthogonality between frequencies. This will be accomplished via a MATLAB code that builds a discrete time record of a SOS where the frequencies are octave harmonics including the sample frequency. All the sinusoids in the SOS start at time zero, have zero phase shift and unity amplitude. We start with all being sine waves and rectify with the cosine r ectification function for each frequency. Then the SOS will be all cosine waves and we will rectify with the sine rec tification function. We expect the crosstalk to always be zero and thus preserve orthogonality between frequencies For this evaluation we pick the SOS to consist of 10 distinct frequencies all of which are octave- and harmonically-related with the highest frequency having 32 samples per period. The time record length is 1 period of the lowest frequency. For Case 1, the SOS is made from discrete sine waves and for Case 2 the SOS is made from discrete cosine waves  Case 1 SOS is unity amplitude sine waves, 10 octave frequencies with 32 samples per period of the highest frequency. The SOS time record length is 1 period of the lowest frequency We will test for orthogonality between frequencies by deleting from the SOS an arbitrary frequency and then use FST to detect it. Anything that is detected will be crosstalk corruption. We choose to delete the 3rd frequency. The results for sine and cosine rectification FST are  Outs  0.6366  0.6366  0.0000  0.6366 0.6366 0.6366 0.6366  0.6365  0.6361    Outc  0.0001  0.0002  0.0000  0.0010 0.0020   0.0039  0.0078  0.0156  0.0313  0   As expected there is no response at the 3rd frequency. In fact, whichever frequency is deleted there will be no response at that frequency thus orthogonality between frequencies is considered valid relative to a SOS  Case 2 SOS is cosine waves \(SOC\itto everything else. Now if we delete an arbitrary frequency from the SOC and then try to detect it, we will be measuring crosstalk and if there is orthogonality between frequencies the result should be zero We choose to delete the 5th frequency and the cosine and sine results respectively are  Outc  0.6366  0.6366  0.6366  0.6366 0.0000 0.6366 0.6366  0.6365  0.6361    Outs  0.0001  0.0002  0.0005  0.0010 0.0000 0.0039 0.0078  0.0156  0.0313    Again as expected, there is no response at the 5th frequency. In fact whichever frequency is deleted, there will be no response at that fre quency; thus orthogonality between frequencies is considered valid relative to a SOC  2  N ON Z ERO R ECTIFICATION FST  A PPLIED TO A B ATTERY M ODEL  This non-zero rectification version of the FST algorithm will be evaluated with the recursive implementation of the INL Lumped Parameter Model \(LPM  This is the sam e  approach that was used in th e analytical validation of the CSD algorithm  The sam e  ty pical LPM  param e ters from  the CSD evaluation were again used. Several cases were analyzed and results plotted as FST compared to ideal LPM impedance \(classical j   2 section will convert those relations into an FST algorithm that can be realized as co mputer code. A rectification function is simply a unity amplitude square wave. FST uses two forms at each frequency one with the phase relationship of a sine wave and the other with the phase relationship of a cosine wave. In the continuous time domain, the perfect unit rectification function makes an instant transition from -1 to 1. In the discrete time domain, this is not the case and the implementation of a rectification function must preserve FST orthogonality between diffe rent frequencies. In a discrete rectification function, there are two options for transitioning from +1 to -1 and the reverse: pass through zero at a discrete time step or pass through zero midway between discrete time steps. It will be shown that both options will give nearly identical results. We will consider only the latter as it is the simplest  Non-Zero Rectification Function  The sine and cosine wave form of such a function is given as Equations 9, 10 respectively   1 0 2  1 2 N n Rs n N nN 212\002       9   1 0 4 3  1 44 3 1 4 N n NN Rc n n N nN  003 circuit analysis\were 212 002  002

  5 Hardware Implementation During the summer of 2008, the FST algorithm based upon the non-zero rectification was implemented on the CSD NASA hardware platform  This new hardware platform is a significant upgrade to the earlier versi A t e st was performed using a small 1800mA hr Li Ion battery obtained from INL. Three different algor ithms were run: FST \(0.10 Hz to 1920 Hz, time record 1 period\ CSD \(0.10 Hz to 1500 Hz \(9 frequencies logarithmically spread\time record 3 periods\ Harmonic octaves \(0.10 Hz to 1638.4 Hz, time record 1 period\onic is a CSD like algorithm described in detail in [6 e resu lts are sh o w n  in  th e following Excel Nyquist and magnitude plots                                     It was observed that the magnitude responses for all three algorithms were very close. In the Nyquist plot, Harmonic and FST were very close but CSD was slightly different This is attributed to the CSD phase response being slightly different at the higher frequencies. It was also observed that computer data processing with FST was noticeably quicker than Harmonic or CSD \(there was no attempt to measure the actual time\onic and FST used a SOS time record length of 1 period of the lowest frequency in duration and there was no observation of results being corrupted by a transient response from this Li Ion battery  3  C ONCLUSIONS  The FST non-zero rectification has been validated analytically. The alternate form of rectification, with zeros has been shown elsewhere to gi ve identical results to the non-zero form The rect i f i cat i on wi t hout zeros i s  easi e r to implement for FST as it involves preprocessing the time record by just sign changes, and then summing all the samples. The non-zero FST algorithm was hardware validated [6 an d  in itial testin g h as sh o w n ex cellen t resu lts The FST algorithm did appear to process noticeably faster than the CSD algorithm and there was no evidence of a battery transient response that can corrupt the impedance measurement based on the very limited number of batteries tested. Thus, a time record length of one period of the lowest frequency has been shown and a real time in-situ battery impedance measurement is feasible R EFERENCES  1  Jon P.

The excitation Sum of Sines \(SOS\gnal formation, the methodology to apply it as a current signal to a test battery and the capture of the battery voltage response time record is almost identical to the CSD approach. The difference is, if th e SOS excitation time record contains only sine waves whose frequencies are all related by octave and harmonics, and the sample time is also octave- and harmonicallyrelated, then if that captured time record is "rectified" rela tive to one of the SOS frequencies, when that transformed time record is summed it will contain only battery response informati on relative to that frequency To identify a specific battery frequency response in the SOS signal, the response time record is square wave rectified with a phase relationship relative to a  sine wave of that frequency. Then all the points in the time record of that transformed signal are simply totaled up and normalized to the number of periods of that frequency present in the SOS signal. This result becomes a numerical parameter 1 m The process is performed again excep t the rectification square wave phase is relative to the cosine of the frequency of interest. This other resu lt becomes another numerical parameter 2 m For all the other frequencies, except the one of interest, all the samples of those sine waves of the transformed record will always total to zero. The amplitude and phase response of that frequency are obtained as per the follo wing relationships. Equation 1 represents the signal component at a specific frequency that is to be detected. The amplitude P V and phase  006 is the sample period  In Equation 3 the signal has been rectified relative to a sine wave of that frequency and all the sample values totaled up  1 1 2 1 0 2 22 sin sin N N PP N n n mV n V n NN 004 are the desired information  22 2 sin sin cos cos sin PP P VnVnV n NN N   006 2 Where t 212 212   005\005  004 004        3 In Equation 4 the signal has been rectified relative to the cosi ne wave of that frequency and again the samples are totaled up  Observe that rectification simply involves changing the sign of th e sample values relative to the sine wave or cosine wave timing  13 1 1 44 2 0 3 44 22 2 sin sin sin NN N PP P NN n nn mV n V n V n NN N 004 004 004      4 004 is the phase response of the frequency of interest  n is the discrete time index  In Equation 1 N must be constrained as 2 log   N must be an integer greater than 1.

The FST algorithm must preserve the property of orthogonality between the different frequencies. Additionally, any noise present even after rectifica tion will be mitigated by the summation process. Thus for this  technique, mathematically, crosstalk from adjacent frequencies will be zero and the SO S time record length can be as short as one period of the lowest fre quency. However, the FST method only works if the octave harmonic relationship holds for all frequencies in the SOS including the sample frequency. This en sures that over a period of any frequency present in the SOS there will always be an even number of samples. The implementa tion of the rectification functions with discrete signals in a manner that preserves orthogonality between different frequencies is developed within this paper
