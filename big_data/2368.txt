process chemoinformatics drug discovery informatics   1. Introduction  Previously research and development R&D for drug discovery process was divided into chemoinformatics and bioinformatics However future pharmaceuticals are moving ahead towards integrating both chemoinformatics and bioinformatics into one entity called drug discovery informatics in order to serve healthcare applications. One of the main issues in such integration is how to analyze integrated data from both 
unstructured data existing in PubMed 1  a n d  structured data existing in public databases such as KEGG 2   T h e r e  i s  a  n e e d  f o r  s y s t e m s  t h a t  h e l p  i n  better understanding diseases at the molecular level by studying underlying interactions and identifying key molecular players that seem to be involved in disease development Accordingly certain molecules would be proposed as drug targets either for gene therapies or conventional chemical drug therapies which will provide a great value to biologists 
Drug discovery is a very critical issue in the pharmaceutical industry that has six main phases: drug target discovery, target validation, assay development screening lead optimization and development In order to speedup the first phase of the drug discovery process which is the drug target discovery we have developed DruTiMine Drug Target Integrative Miner  It is a system that aims at enhancing and shortening the process of drug target discovery for pharmaceutical companies and research labs concer 
ned with drug discovery It is a semi-automated system for drug target discovery through integration of multiple biomedical resources related to a specific disease such as genes proteins and chemical compounds in a novel mining process The paper is organized as follows: section 2 illustrates related work to our proposed system, section 3 describes the system in details, section 4 outlines DruTiMine Case Studies  Usage scenario discussion of results is shown in section 5 and finally section 6 gives the conclusions 
and future work  2. Related Work  A few number of related works exists such as MEDTAKMI \(Medical Text Analysis and Knowledge Mining\, developed at IBM Tokyo research center [3  for performing text mining tasks on medical documents.  Several groups in IBM research divisions 


  w orldwide have developed BioTeKS Biological Knowledge Services 4    I t  i s  a  t e x t  m i n i n g  s y s t e m  that can be integrated with search engines. It provides extensive text search capabilities and has hierarchical category chronological two-dimensional and trend analysis viewers BioTeKS analyzes biomedical text and other medical records, where terms and names are automatically identified Various software products have been released into the market that helps in the drug discovery process For example SAS Scientific Discovery Solutions and Enterprise Miner for Discovery Process 5  i s  a  m i n i n g  p r o d u c t  f o r  analyzing large amounts of genes and proteins, having a mining infrastructure DiscoveryLink 6  i s  a n o t h e r  software product which encompasses data management solution for Drug Discovery  3. System description  Given a Microarray \(MA\ experiment related to a specific disease selected by the user where overexpressed and underexpressed genes of interest are identified DruTiMine can determine drug targets constituting of bioentities genes and proteins and biochemicals together with related information and mine the associations among them. The process starts by assembling disease-related DNA Microarray data from multiple gene expression databases Analysis of multiple Microarray data follows resulting in a filtered list of genes Biomedical texts relevant to this gene list disease and tissue type are collected and text mining is utilized to extract expert driven knowledge about such genes its relationships with other genes proteins and biochemicals This knowledge is then integrated with several heterogeneous genomic and biochemical databases to build an integrated data layer for performing integrative data mining  3.1. Architecture  DruTiMine architecture is outlined in Figure1 The system main components are: document retrieval using multiple microarray experiments text mining and data mining   Document retrieval component is responsible for retrieving related documents, given     multiple microarray experiments for a specific disease and tissue type Text mining component mainly discovers and annotates related proteins in the retrieved documents Finally data mining component generates association rules describing the relationships among data integrated from analyzed text describing proteins and data existing in public databases illustrating protein characteristics such as Gene Ontology chemical reactions and chemical compounds having biological interests to proteins  3.2. Process  DruTiMine follows the following process Fig ure 1: DruTiMine Architecture  


   3 2.1 MA experiment retrieval  One of the most challenging tasks is how to download and integrate Microarray experiments from multiple resources Several online Microarray databases exist such as Gene Expression Omnibus GEO 7 8   ArrayExpress 9 10  a n d  S t a n f o r d  M i c r o a r r a y  Database SMD 11   H o w e v e r   t h e  c u r r e n t  implementation only supports GEO making use of its web services E-utilities since it is a MIAME compliant 12  r e p o s i t o r y   F u r t h e r m o r e   G E O  h a s  various kinds of data allowing the user to submit search and retrieve microarray experiments for different platforms. The data include microarray-based experiments measuring the abundance of mRNA genomic DNA and protein molecules, as well as nonarray-based technologies such as Serial Analysis of Gene Expression SAGE and mass spectrometry proteomic technology Our main focus is on gene expression data, using Affymetrix platform MA experiment retrieval starts by a user query specifying the disease and tissue type the software connects to GEO and retrieves the experiments that match search criteria The user then chooses which experiments to download locally. Data files, stored in SOFT Simple Omnibus Format in Text format are parsed in order to enable batch deposit of multiple platforms samples and/or Series data in one file or directory  3.2.2 MA standardization through GEO-MAGE Modeler  This phase consists of three main parts 1 SOFT-OM [13  p a c k a g e  i s  u s e d  t o  p a r s e  G E O  S O F T  files and convert them into an intermediate object model based on GEO\222s schema, 2\ PackageModellers 13  c o n v e r t s  t h e  i n t e r m e d i a t e  S O F T O M  t o  i t s  respective MAGE-OM 13   a n d  3   M A G E O M   1 3   hosts the main class for this component GEOmodeller This class reads in from the SearchResults of MA data retriever component calls classes of SOFT-OM and then calls classes of packageModellers The MAGE object is saved into two parts the Experiment MAGE-object and the Array MAGE object The experiment MAGE-object contains the following MAGE packages Array BioMaterial BioAssay QuantitationType BioAssayData and Experiment Packages Array MAGE object contains the following MAGE packages Description Bios-equence DesignElement and ArrayDesign packages  3.2.3 MA analysis Identifying which genes are differentially expressed in a microarray experiment will lead to significant results, such as which genes are affected under specific treatment or finding marker genes that are determined under a specific case. Both clustering 14 15  a n d  s t a t i s t i c a l  a n a l y s i s  h a v e  b e e n  performed to achieve this goal.   The most commonly used statistical test for finding differentially expressed genes is the classical t-test and ANOVA. In this work the two-sample t-test 16 17  h a s  b e e n  p e r f o r m e d  i n  order to distinguish differentially expressed genes in cases of diseased versus undiseased experiments where the formula used is as in equation \(1 001\002\003\002\004\005\006\007\b\002\t\002\005\006\007\n\013\002\f\002\r\006\007\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\002\004\b\013\002 Where xi,1 is the mean value of gene i in group 1, xi,2 is the mean in group 2 and si is the non-pooled within- groups standard error \(SE\ for gene i  3.2.4 Document retrieval Given a user-specified disease for a specific tissue the main objective is to retrieve documents related to such a disease for further text mining Microarray experiments help to discover which genes are differentially expressed Once we have the list of the differentially expressed genes in MA experiments, that are related to a specific disease and tissue type, the gene names \(and their synonyms are used as 221keywords\222 to search for the related documents in Medline abstract database  3.2.5. Document text mining The retrieved abstracts are then annotated with a dictionary based text analytic engine annotator We use a 221Protein dictionary\222 a 221Disease dictionary\222 a 221Drug dictionary\222 and a 221Chemical Compound\222 dictionary The annotated protein names are collected and additional related data are fetched from SwissProt and KEGG public databases Whereas the annotated chemical compounds, diseases and drugs are saved in files that may help biologists in understanding interpreting  or clarifying some ambiguous issues that may arise during the process The system computes the number of abstracts in the collection of retrieved abstracts where each protein name appears together with the disease name and tissue type. A user defined threshold for the minimum number of abstracts where the protein was cited \(together with the disease name and tissue type is used in order to reinforce the confidence in the association between a selected protein and a specified disease. Therefore, only protein names that appeared \(with the disease name and tissue type in at least a minimum number above a threshold of abstracts will be further processed in DruTiMine  


  3 2.6 Data retrieval from public databases and integration Data mined from biomedical literature do not constitute enough resources for discovering and proposing identified drug targets for specific diseases Public databases provide a huge resource of biological and chemical information as well They provide information focusing on specific domains such as protein databases \(i.e., Swissprot, PDB [18   a n d  D I P  19    K y o t o  e n c y c l o p e d i a  o f  g e n e s  a n d  g e n o m e s  KEGG\. In addition, they have major characteristics such as heterogeneity varied interface and query capabilities Data retrieval in DruTiMine takes a list of protein names identified during text mining as related to a specific disease and tissue type retrieves the associated data from public databases and store the values in a DruTiMine database The design of this component supports two public databases for proteins and generelated data, which are Swissprot and KEGG The current implementation uses Swissprot protein database to get the following protein attributes: protein functions motif 3D structure domain Gene Name Gene Ontologies Gene molecular functions Gene biological processes and Gene cellular components For each Gene ID appearing with protein names chemical reactions and chemical compounds are retrieved from KEGG database  3.2.7 Association Rule Mining In DruTiMine datasets that are the result of identifying a list of protein names related to a disease and their associated data, are multi-valued and usually has a small number of records  First the multi-valued data problem is defined as a category that can have multi-values For example a protein may have one or more functions such as 1433Y_Human protein can have functions by binding to a large number of partners usually by recognition of a phosphoserine or phosphothreonine motif Second when mining is performed specific algorithms are required to handle a relatively small number of records. To deal with these characteristics we propose a multi-basket miner methodology  3.2.8 Multi-basket Miner  Multi-basket miner method is developed in order to handle multi-valued datasets with small number of records in Dru-TiMine Most of the published work on association rule mining has used the traditional horizontal transactional format However several approaches have proposed the vertical transactional format [20, 21, 22    I n  a  v e r t i c a l  database each item is associated with its corresponding tid set the set of all transactions or tids where it appears Vertical representation has shown its effectiveness due to the fact that frequent patterns can be counted via tid set intersections instead of using complex internal data structures In 23   Y A F I M A  used leap-traversal, showing that leap traversal is more efficient for obtaining frequent patterns than the previous mentioned approaches. Leap traversal obtain patterns of different sizes, where frequent sub-patterns can be found.  In the current system, a new association rule mining method is proposed named multi-basket miner to handle a variety of data representation utilizing a vertical representation for the data and a leap traversal approach.  Multi-basket miner considers each item as a basket by itself Problem Definition Let I  I1 I2  Im be a set of literals called items and a transaction database PTD where each transaction T is a set of items such that 016\002 002 017   A unique identifier TID is given to each transaction A transaction T is said to contain X, a set of items in I, if 020\002 002 016 An association rule is said to be of the form 020\002 003\021\002 022\007\002 020\002 002 002 017\007\002 022\002 002 017\007\002 023\024\025\002 020\002 001 002 022\002 003\002 026\027   In the current case, each item by itself contains a set of other items.  For example 017\b\002\003\002\030\006\b\007\002\006\n\031\002\006\032\033 where r is the number of items in I1 basket. A pattern A is frequent if A\222s support is no less than a predefined minimum support threshold 034  Multi-basket Miner Method Input  Transactional protein database PTD and a minimum support threshold 034  Output Association rules Method steps b\027  035\036\023\024\002\001\032\023\024\r\023\036\001\006\037\024\002\025\023\001\023 \023\r!\002\037\024\036!\007\002"\016#\027\002\002 n\027  006\r\001\003'\032!\(\!\024\001\002\b%\006\001!*\r\002\006\024\002+\023\032\006\037\\r\002 \023\r,!\001\r\027\002\002 027  001\002 003\026\007\002 0!\032!\002 002 006\r\002 0010!\002 032!\(\!\024\001\002 1\023\001\001!\032\024\002 023\r!\002/!\002\036\023\024\0022!\001\002\006\024\002"\016#\027\002\002 3\027  001\002 035\003\026\007\002 0!\032!\002 035\002 006\r\002 0010!\002 r\ \002 1\023\001\001!\032\024\r\002 2!\024 032\023\001!\025\027\002\002 4\027  001\002 032!\(\!\024\001\003\026\007\002 0!\032!\002 032!\(\!\024\001\002 036\037\024\001\023\006\024\r\002 0010!\002&\006\r\001\002\037'\002'\032!\(\!\024\001\0021\023\001\001!\032\024\r\027\002\002 5\027  60\006&!\002\004$%&\006\r\001\002\006\r\002\024\037\001\002!*1\0017\013\002\025\037\002 5\027\b\027  0038 \001\023\006\024!\025\002 004'\032!\(\!\024\001\002 1\023\001\001!\032\024\002 023\r!\002 037\036\036\\032\032\006\0242\002 023\r\002 023\024\002 006\024\001!\032\r!\036\001\006\037\024\002 037'\002 032\001\006\036\023&\002 1\032!\r!\024\001\023\001\006\037\024\002 037\032\002 006\001!*\r\002 037\036\036\\032\032\006\0242\002 006\024\002 023\032\006\037\\r\002 \023\r,!\001\r\013\002 5\027\n\027  017'\002.\002\025\037\002\024\037\001\002!\005\006\r\001\002\006\024\002$\032!\(\!\024\001\002\0010!\024\002 5\027\n\027\b\027  032!\(\!\024\001\002\003\002$\032!\(\!\024\001\002 002.\002 5\027\n\027\n\027  035\002 003\002 9!\024!\032\023\001!\002 r\ \002 1\023\001\001!\032\024\r\002 032\037*\002 002/0\006\0360\002\0010!\006\032\002\r\11\037\032\001\002\021\003\002\034\002 5\027\n\027-\027  017'\002 035\002 006\r\002 024\037\001\002 037\\024\025\002 006\024\002 032!\(\!\024\001\007\002 0010!\024\002$\032!\(\!\024\001\002\003\002$\032!\(\!\024\001\002 002\035\027\002 027  9!\024!\032\023\001!\002\023\r\r\037\036\006\023\001\006\037\024\002\032\&!\r\002'\037\032\002$\032!\(\!\024\001\027\002 


  A fter multi-basket miner is applied and all association rules are generated a list of protein identifiers is retrieved from our database These protein ids are the list of target proteins, related to he discovered associations by DruTiMine  4. DruTiMine case studies and usage scenario  DruTiMine has been tested using cancer disease for eight different tissues breast kidney ovarian prostate pancreatic liver skin and lung For each type of cancer we retrieved multiple microarray experiments and follow the process as described above We used the following protein characteristics Protein function motif 3D structure interaction and related data for each protein Gene which holds the information of the protein\222s chemical Compound and chemical reaction We will describe a system usage scenario based on breast cancer as an example Starting with breast cancer all related microarray experiments are downloaded from GEO. Furthermore a user can choose a specific experiment, by examining an abstract explaining the purpose of this experiment and its main goal, as illustrated in Figure 2. For each experiment, the user interface contains the experiment identifier called ExpID experiment title and database, which is GEO in our case  Each selected experiment is converted into MAGE form, through GEO-Modeler in order to obtain the required content of the microarray experiment In addition to 221MAGE-fying\222 microarray experiments selected experiments are annotated in order to find differentially expressed genes.  Differentially expressed genes can be found by several methods per experiment, per group of genes, in all existing groups of genes and correlated genes in selected experiments In this example differentially expressed genes are identified using t-test analysis which are ESR1 CALCR FLJ10178 CRYAB PADI4 and HSPA6 For each differentially expressed gene the system searches and collects abstracts of documents from Medline database related to those genes and breast cancer Abstracts are analyzed by a Text analysis engine and Proteins are annotated For each chosen disease and tissue, the list of annotated proteins, in the abstract collection, is retrieved, as illustrated in Figure 3. For the retrieved protein list, protein characteristics are retrieved from Swissprot database, as well as Gene Ontology molecular function Gene Ontology cellular component and Gene Ontology biological process Furthermore for each protein its gene-related information including chemical compounds and chemical reaction related to this protein are retrieved from KEGG database  Each retrieved protein can have more than one Gene Ontology Biological process such as ESR2_HUMAN has three biological processes cell-cell signaling estrogen receptor signaling path-way, negative regulation of cell growth regulation of transcription and DNA-dependent Figure 4 shows only a part of the multi-basket we can get for breast cancer protein characteristics  Having such case of multi-valued categories multi-basket miner is applied, where association rules are generated, describing relationships between protein Fig ure 2: Retrieved Microarray Experiments for a Given Disease Fig ure 3: Retrieval of Protein 


  m otif function 3D structure interaction Gene Ontology molecular function, Cellular component, and biological process and Gene-related chemical compound and chemical reaction as illustrated in Figure 5 As a result, these association rules are used to get protein identifiers/gene/chemical compounds which might be proposed as drug targets for breast cancer   For example one of the association rules indicated that Biological Processes regulation of transcription DNA-dependent is associated with Cellular Components  nucleus when minimum support equals 4 and minimum  confidence equals 0.5 This association rule suggests that proteins having these characteristics are proposed to be drug targets for breast cancer, which are ESR2_HUMAN, Q15636_HUMAN Q9H2M1_HUMAN, Q9H2M2_HUMAN \(Swissprot protein ids A similar procedure is applied for chemical compounds  5. Discussion  Applying DruTiMine on several tissues for cancer has proven the validity of the system where text mining and association rule mining are used based on microarray experiments to identify drug targets for the specified disease and tissue type. DruTiMine can help pharmaceuticals to identify drug targets of proteins/genes/chemical compounds in silicon instead of going through major steps of laboratory tests in vitro This does not mean that laboratory tests will not be needed, but the need for systems like DruTiMine is becoming a must for providing guidance to experts before conducting laboratory experiments Microarray experiments have proven through DruTiMine, to be very useful for deriving drug targets of proteins/genes/chemical compounds. The system is capable of relating proteins identified in Medline database abstracts to differentially expressed genes in microarray experiments and provided insight on possible associations among a variety of related biological information such as gene molecular functions gene biological process and gene cellular components which is definitely of value in speeding up the drug target discovery phase of the drug discovery process      6. C onclusions and future work  DruTiMine has been introduced as a new system for identifying drug targets based on microarray experiments  Given a user-selected disease and associated criteria as mentioned above the user can identify drug targets related to this disease starting with microarray experiments.  We have explained the architecture process and usage scenario of how to discover drug targets through the integration between text mining and association rule mining We have tested our system to cancer with eight different tissues breast kidney ovarian prostate pancreatic liver skin, and lung.  In our future work, we will develop a protein-protein interaction network describing the type of interaction we can extract from related publications in order to understand the type of interaction affecting diseases Finally regarding our microarray experiments\222 retrieval we intend to consider other microarray databases such as ArrayExpress and Stanford microarray database  7.

Therefore, in this paper we mainly focused on the problem to find all the longest intervals for each cycle To confront the above problem efficiently, we introduced two main search techniques IVP Interval Validation Process\ and PSM \(Process Switching Mechanism\.  In this paper we have presented an effective mining approach for finding all the periodic time intervals for a given sequential pattern. As a future work the process presented in this paper can be extended to find periodic time intervals for all the given sequential patterns in one database scan However to accomplish this task a more complex data-structure/memory management technique needs to be implemented REFERENCES 1  X  Chen and I.
