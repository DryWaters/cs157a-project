given set, based on how they appear together in multiple subsets of that set. Extensive literature exists on the development of efficient algorithms for association mining computations, and the fundamental motivation for this literature is that association mining reveals actionable insights and enables better policies This motivation is proven valid for domains such as retailing healthcare and software engineering, where elements of the analyzed set are physical or virtual items that appear in transactions. However, the literature does not prove this motivation for databases where items are \223derived items\224, rather than actual items. This study investigates the association patterns in changes of exchange rates of US Dollar, Euro and Gold in the 
Turkish economy, by representing the percentage changes as 223derived items\224 that appear in \223derived market baskets\224, the day on which the observations are made. The study is one of the few in literature that applies such a mapping and applies association mining in exchange rate analysis, and the first one that considers the Turkish case. Actionable insights, along with their policy implications, demonstrate the usability of the developed analysis approach Keywords - association mining; case study; finance; exchange rates; investment science; portfolio management I   I NTRODUCTION  Data mining is the field of computer science that aims at discovering interesting and actionable insights from data 
Association mining is the subfield of data mining that analyzes association patterns in a transactions given database for elements of a given set [2,3  T h e t r an s a cti o n d ata b as e c o n s i s ts  of transactions that consist of subsets of the element set. The most fundamental results of association mining are frequent itemsets in the form Item 1  Item 2 205 Item n and association rules in the form Antec 1  Antec 2 205 Antec n  Conseq which respectively report the items that frequently appear together in 
transactions, and the antecedent items that signal the existence of a consequent item 1 Frequent itemsets are characterized by support the percentage of transactions among all transactions that the itemset appears in. Association rules are characterized    1 In this paper, we will only consider the case with a single item in the consequent  by confidence the conditional probability of observing the consequent when the antecedents exist, besides support While extensive literature exists on the development of efficient algorithms for association mining computations [2 the fundamental motivation is that association mining reveals 
actionable insights and enables better policies. The applicability and usefulness of association mining is wellknown in domains such as retailing [5,6,7  h e alth c a r e  8   a n d  software engineering [9 w h e r e  t h e t r a n sa ct i o n da t a b a s e  contains real or virtual items in market baskets individual transactions\or example, in retailing, items are the actual physical products \(ex: milk, bread\ puchased by customers in their purchase transactions \(ex: shopping receipt at the supermarket\, and each transaction corresponds to a market basket. However, it is not always clear how association mining can be applied to model data that does not contain actual items but rather derived items How can the data in these domains be transformed to a form that will enable association mining? Will 
the results be meaningful? This study is an application of association mining on such a derived  market basket data  where the items are not really items, but are patterns discretized values of changes in exchange rates\ that are represented as items The database used in this study is composed of exchange rates for US Dollar and Euro, and Gold in the Turkish economy, throughout an 11 year period. The changes in exchange rates for the present day, and the three days before the present day, are discretized to obtain derived items. For association mining, the data set being used needs to have one of two features  [1  F i rs t l y  i t s h ou l d c o n t a i n  ex t e n s i v e historical data, translating into a large number of rows. 11 
years of data is stored in the constructed database. Secondly there has to be a large number of items, so that their analysis can yield interesting results. Our database consists of items that represent the four days of three commodities, that can take up to 61 values each \(30 intervals in each direction, and the case of no change\ resulting in 732 potential items \(of which 644 are observed\, and satisfying this second condition This study contributes to the literature in two ways 1\ Association mining is used for derived items rather than items that correspond to actual entities. The applicability of the 


methodology for this type of data is illustrated through a case study in the field of finance 2\ Association mining is used for analyzing exchange rate data from Turkey for the first time in literature. While other data mining techniques have been applied extensively for analyzing and specifically predicting exchange rates 11,12,13,14,15 h i s i s  o n e o f t h e ver y fe w a p p l i c a t i o ns  o f  association mining for this domain, and, to the best of our knowledge, the only one for Turkey. Two very related studies investigate through association mining the change in foreign exchange rates: Refernce [16 in v es tig at es  cas e of C h in a a n d  Hong Kong, and Reference [1 nve s t i g a t e s ca se o f T a i w a n  Since the results of association mining are in the form of rules they are easy to understand, interpret, and apply. This is a major benefit over sophisticated models that involve complex \226 and even black box- computations II  M ETHODOLOGY AND P ROCESS  A  Data Selection Exchange rate data has been selected for this case study due to its large size \(many years of data\ online availability and due to the importance of financial decision making in individual as well as corporate context. The currency exchange rates have been acquired from the web site of Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey 2 Currencies such as British Pound Chinese Yen, and French Frank were not included since they currencies are not traded in large volumes in Turkey in recent years. To have a complete dataset, that includes all the currencies, it was decided to start the time frame based on the initial date for Euro B  Data Cleaning Initially, Dollar, Euro, and Gold purchase and sales rates were taken, starting from 5 January 1999 and ending at 28 September 2010. However, only the sales rates have been used due to strong correlation between the purchase and sales rates The complete data preparation has been conducted using MS Excel, due to its intuitive interface and flexibility in implementing a variety of functions, including mathematical logical and string manipulation functions. For each commodity four columns have been constructed, corresponding to the exchange rate changes for the present day and the three days before that. The main idea in the created data set was to analyze the percentage changes in rates, rather than the rates themselves. This eliminated any distortions due to differences in scale. For each column, the difference in rates between the selected day and the day before it was obtained, and this change was then converted into percentage change. Since association mining requires discrete elements of a set, the percentage values were discretized based on intervals that represent 0.1% change C  Naming the Variables Through string manipulation functions, the change intervals were given specific names that clearly tell the percentage change, as well as the number of days before. The intervals    2 http://www.tcmb.gov.tr were given names according to the depth of the calculation. For example, the variable \223DollarToday\224 tells how the Dollar rate has changed today, compared to its value yesterday. The values under this column were based on the percentage differences The discretized values are labeled based on the amount of change, as well as the name of the column. For example DollarIncr00Today is the name of the derived item that represents the pattern \(case\ of Dollar purchase price increasing within the interval of 0%-0.1%, compared to its value yesterday. If this same amount of change was under the DollarDayAgo2 column, the derived item would be named as DollarIncr00DayAgo2. The string \223Today\224 at the end of an item\222s name means that comparison is made to yesterday\222s rate, \223DayAgo1\224 means the rate for yesterday is being compared to the rate for the day before, and so on. Fig. 1 illustrates one of the functions that have been implemented in MS Excel while transforming the tabular numerical data to market basket data D  Data Verification Having finished the calculations in MS Excel, the database was ready for further and more detailed data cleaning. The next step was controlling and correcting any mistakes in the data set Every step of the calculations was verified through a systematic quality control process and every resulting column was verified through sampling the rows. The resulting data set was composed of 4287 rows and 12 columns. Reference [18  reports that \223exploratory data mining and data cleaning constitute 80% of the effort that determines 80% of the value of the data mining results\224. As typical in most data mining projects, the data cleaning process consumed a huge amount of time in our case study. Yet, this was a very critical step of the case study, since any mistakes at this point would destroy the validity of the remaining steps, and the case study E  Association Mining Apriori algorithm has been used to perform association mining computations. Christian Borgelt\222s command line Apriori program 3 as well as its GUI version wxApriori 4 were used as the software tools. Once completed, the association mining results have been ported back to MS Excel for detailed analysis and interpretations. Apriori was selected due to prior experience of the authors with the software tools that implement Apriori. Computations were completed in less than one minute in the study, and were done only once for frequent itemsets and once for association rules. Thus, there was no need for using more efficient algorithms, such as FP-growth III  A NALYSIS AND R ESULTS  In this section, sample actionable insights obtained through association mining are presented. Alongside the insights, the policies that are derived from the insights are given. Where possible, the Tables from which the insights are derives are given, and the rows related with the insights are highlighted with bold font    3 http://www.borgelt.net/apriori.html 4 http://www.stkpp.org 


 Figure 1  Decreasing percentages calculation functions for MS Excel  The insights and their accompanying policy suggestions appeal to investors with diverse backgrounds: Policies 1,2, and 3 are very intuitive and basic, and would contribute only to novice investors. The remaining policies, however, are not obvious, and can help investment professionals, as well Insight 1 Items related to gold have larger support values and gold appears in more frequent itemsets than Dollar or Euro. Among the top 100 frequent itemsets which have the highest support values, approximately 80% of them include an item related with gold. Therefore association patterns that involve gold have higher support Policy 1 Gold is a more predictable investment instrument since its frequent patterns have high predictability TABLE I  SUPPORT  LEVELS  FOR  DIFFERENT  ITEMSETS Item Support  GoldIncr00Today 23.0 GoldDecr00Today 19.1 GoldIncr01Today 17.9 GoldIncr02Today 10.0 GoldDecr01Today 9.8 GoldIncr03Today 5.1 GoldDecr02Today 3.9 GoldDecr03Today 3.2 GoldIncr04Today 2.6 GoldDecr04Today 1.5 GoldIncr05Today 0.9 GoldIncr08Today 0.8 GoldIncr09Today 0.7 GoldIncr07Today 0.5  Insight 2 Table I\ Gold is more likely to increase than decrease today, compared to yesterday. The number of all transactions that include Gold\222s increase today is more than those that include its decrease, as reflected in the support values. The daily decrease in Gold is at most 0.4% \(observed in only 15 transactions\. Gold\222s decrease being less than 0.1 GoldIncr00Today\ is observed in 715  transactions, with support value of 19.1%. However, gold was observed to increase up to 0.9% in a day. Also, its increase less than 0.1 GoldDecr00Today\is observed in 931 transactions with 23 support value Policy 2 Gold is a good investment instrument if an investor wishes to avoid risk, and experience steady increase in value  Insight 3 Only Dollar and Euro increase in very high percentage as 30% today with respect to yesterday. Gold increases maximum 9% today with respect to yesterday Support value of Euro\222s increase 30% is 0.9%, higher than the 0.8% support for Dollar\222s 30% increase. Confidence of Dollar\222s increases 30%, if Euro increases 30% today is 0.875 due to the higher confidence value we could consider Dollar\222s increase can be connected to Euro\222s increase Policy 3 It is suggested to invest in Dollar or Euro if sudden jumps are desired and also these jumps are happening simultaneously between Dollar and Euro. Thus Dollar and Euro are better than Gold for risk-seeking investors, especially in times of crises when high increases are expected in exchange rates for Dollar and Euro. Gold is suggested if investors need a solid increasing pattern with small amounts. Dollar and Euro have more risk, but the sudden jumps yield much higher returns compared to gold  Insight 4 If Gold decrease or increase less than 0.1% 1 day ago, it will most probably continue to decrease or increase less than 0.1% today. Confidence in the \223decrease of Gold being less than 0.1% if it decreases less than 0.1% 1 day ago\224 is 


98.6%. Confidence in the \223increase of Gold being less than 0.1% if it increases less than 0.1% 1 day ago\224 is  97.4 Policy 4 Gold has a repeating pattern for two consecutive days, with a probability higher than 97%. For a risk-averse investor, it is recommended to invest in Gold if it increased yesterday less than 0.1% and not suggested to invest if it decreased less than 0.1  Insight 5 If Dollar increases less than 0.1 DollarIncr00Today\, one cannot make a certain guess about Euro, since Euro can either increase or decrease with almost the same probabilities \(increase probability of 0.5012 vs decrease probability of 0.4987\. Also, if Dollar decreases by less than 0.1% today \(DollarDecr00Today\, we cannot make any certain guess about Euro for today, it can either increase or decrease again with close probabilities Policy 5 It is not suggested to invest at the days Dollar changed with a 0.1% increase or decrease. On these days, it is very hard to predict what will happen with the exchange rate of Euro, since the probability of \223increase\224 and \223decrease\224 events is almost the same  Insight 6 Table II\ When Gold-related support values in are analyzed, it can be seen that when Gold increases decreases\ in the shown stable decreasing pattern for 3 consecutive days \(increase or decrease by 0.4%, 0.3%, 0.2 consecutively\, it always continues to increase \(decrease\ the next day by 0.1%. Table II shows that the support values of the 3 days process and 4 days process are the same; therefore the confidence in observing 0.1% increase \(decrease\ on the fourth day \(today\s 100 Policy 6 Gold has a particular four days cycle pattern, that is guaranteed to take place if the first three days follow the pattern: Increase \(or decrease\ of 0.4%, 0.3%, 0.2%, and finally 0.1%. If the pattern is observed for the first three days, and if the trend is an increasing one, then it is suggested to invest into gold for the next day, since history has shown that the fourth day has always shown an increase. If the pattern is observed for the first three days, and if the trend is a decreasing one, then one should not invest in Gold on the fourth day TABLE II  EXCHANGE  PATTERNS  FOR  GOLD Itemset Support GoldIncr04DayAgo3 GoldIncr03DayAgo2 GoldIncr02DayAgo1 5.5 GoldIncr04DayAgo3 GoldIncr03DayAgo2 GoldIncr02DayAgo1 GoldIncr01Today 5.5 GoldIncr04DayAgo3 GoldIncr03DayAgo2 GoldIncr02DayAgo1 2.0 GoldIncr04DayAgo3 GoldIncr03DayAgo2 GoldIncr02DayAgo1 GoldIncr01Today 2.0 TABLE III  SUPPORT  LEVELS  FOR  CHANGE  IN  DOLLAR  IN  COMPARISON  TO  THE  PREVIOUS  DAY Item Support  DollarDecr00Today 13.8 DollarIncr00Today 12.6 DollarDecr01Today 9.8 DollarIncr01Today 7.4 DollarDecr02Today 6.6 DollarIncr02Today 5.2 TABLE IV  SUPPORT  LEVELS  FOR  CHANGE  IN  EURO  IN  COMPARISON  TO  THE  PREVIOUS  DAY Item Support  EuroDecr00Today 13.5 EuroIncr00Today 12.2 EuroDecr01Today 9.7 EuroIncr01Today 7.7 EuroDecr00DayAgo1 7.2 EuroDecr02Today 7.0 EuroDecr01DayAgo1 6.9 EuroIncr00DayAgo1 6.3 EuroIncr01DayAgo1 5.9 EuroIncr02Today 5.6 EuroDecr00DayAgo2 5.6 EuroDecr02DayAgo1 5.3 EuroDecr03DayAgo1 4.9 EuroDecr02DayAgo2 4.9  Insight 7 Table III\ollar is more inclined to decrease than increase today \(due to the higher support values of decreasing\. For every percentage value, the support for decrease is higher than the support for increase Policy 7 Dollar rate has more tendency to decrease today compared to yesterday, so it is not a safe stable investment option  Insight 8 Table IV\ When Euro\222s support values are observed in, one observes that Euro is more inclined to decrease than increase \(just like Dollar Policy 8 Euro rate has more tendency to decrease today compared to yesterday, so it is not a safe stable investment option  Insight 9 Table V\ The support and confidence levels of the first itemset composed of GoldIncr00DayAgo1 and GoldIncr00Today are very high. With 97.5% chance yesterday\222s pattern of at most 0.1% increase results in at most 0.1% increase today. This pattern is observed in 41% of all transactions \(days\. At this point we can easily implement a policy Policy 9 We can say that if Gold is increased at most 0.1 yesterday it will increase 0.1% today with a 97.5% chance  Insight 10 In Table VI, we are seeing association rules with two antecedent items and one consequent item. For example the first rule is telling us if gold is increased 0.1 


yesterday and today, the Euro value will decrease 0.1% with a 98.8% confidence and this is seen 10.1% of all transactions Policy 10 For the days that the value of gold increased 0.1% \(in the interval [0.1,0.2\\ two days in a row, investing in Euro is not suggested, because with a very high confidence Euro value will decrease 0.1% \(in the interval [0.1,0.2  Insight 11 In Table VII, an interesting case is observed The confidence level of the first rule in the table is 100%. This means these three items are happening always together Policy 11 At this point we do not need to implement any policies with effort. Because it is lying there clearly when gold value is increased in the limits of Incr00 and the Dollar purchase value is decreased in the limits of Decr04 the next day the value of gold will increase within the limits of Incr00 Moreover it also has a reasonable support level at 2.6% as we compared it to the total number of transactions  IV  D ISCUSSIONS  This paper is showing a study of association mining on selected exchange currency rates \(US Dollar and Euro\and Gold. Based on the association mining and the found associations, several actionable insights have been discovered and have been interpreted with regards to policy making The suggested policies are not forecasts, but rather rules of the game that are easy to understand and apply. Meanwhile the insights and the policies generated do not involve any black-box models, such as neural networks. Instead, the policies can be applied without any further computations. Yet the classic shortcoming of data mining applies in this study, as well: Data mining assumes that the future will repeat the past and historical data can be used for deriving policies to be implemented in the future V  C ONCLUSIONS  This study is an application of association mining on US Dollar, Euro, and Gold exchange rates in Turkey. The rates for these investment instruments were taken for an eleven year period starting from the year 1999 and ending at the year 2010 The data set created went through a data mining and association mining to find out associations between the changes in the exchange rates. While applying association mining to understanding exchange rates in Turkey for the first time, this study also demonstrated how association mining can be applied with derived items and how it enables actionable insights  A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The authors thank students of the MS 451 Data Visualization and Analysis course in Fall 2010, and especially Ozan Bozk 365 r and P 365 nar Toksoy for their work that helped this research, and their suggested insights regarding the study R EFERENCES  1  J.

study, a clustering and SOM technique is employed. All the transactions of e-shoppers may be allocated to a certain cluster and a cluster number imposed. The change in the cluster number resulting from each transaction determines a e-shopper purchase sequence. By observing changes in the cluster number of each e-shopper over time, a buying sequence can be built for each e-shopper.

First, transaction clustering is conducted, so that all the transactions of e-shoppers are clustered. The SOM technique is used to cluster target e-shoppers transactions Then it is necessary to detect the evolving e-shopper purchase sequences as time passes. These e-shopper behaviors, which are derived from a change in the cluster number of each e-shopper, are kept in the purchase sequence database. Finally sequential purchase patterns over user-specified minimum support and confidence are extracted by using the association rule. The sequential purchase patterns are then stored in the association rule database Although SOM technique can obtains transaction clusters SOM clustering technique often breaks down when handling very high-dimensional data. So it is proposed that using product classes represents the hierarchical relationships among products. The method can make an effective dimensionality reduction while improving clustering results Assume that a product class set P  is classified into n different subclasses, and that each subclass consists of subclasses at a lower level, or eventual leaf products, as follows PPPPP nn ,, 121 ?= "                          \(1 Suppose that C is the set of the transactions of m e-shoppers during s periods before timeT . More specifically letC be composed as follows CCC kTmkTkTC ???= ,,2,1 ,, "                   \(2 11,0 ?= sk "  2?s WhereC kTj ?, ?C  is a non-empty subset of products Each C kTj ?,  represents the product class or classes from which e-shopper j purchased products at time kT EveryC kTj ?,  is transformed into an input matrix composed of a bit vector, and the matrix to be transformed is used in the transaction clustering. The time-ordered vectors for a particular e-shopper represent the purchasing history of the 


e-shopper; this input matrix can be thought of as the dynamic profile of the e-shopper. A dynamic e-shopper profile is defined as follows Let C _ be a dynamic e-shopper profile. Then, C _ is defined by the following matrix for n product classes and m e-shoppers over the course of s periods  3 mj "2,1 11,0 ?= sk " 2?s Where                         1 if Pi?C kTj   All the transactions of e-shoppers in the training e-shopper purchase database are transformed into dynamic e-shopper profiles based on their prior purchase behaviors. Then we use the SOM clustering technique to assign each transaction to a group. This transaction clustering facilitates the discovery of the dynamic cluster sequence of e-shopper The transaction clustering results in the following set of q clusters DDDD q"21 ,=                             \(4 Where each Di is a subset of C _ the given in \(3 A rearrangement of these clusters by  e-shopper  and by time  period is necessary for the identification of the dynamic behavior of each e-shopper. It is possible to learn the cluster sequence of a e-shopper by identifying the cluster to which each transaction of the e-shopper belongs, during each time period. To formalize this concept, we use the following terminology Let BP j be the behavior pattern of e-shopper j . Then, the behavior pattern BPi is identical to the changes in the cluster number of e-shopper j during s periods and is defined as follows  5 Where D kTj ?, ?D ,11,0 ?= sk "  2?s The  process  of searching for  a behavior path can 


be simply conducted through transaction clustering. All e-shoppers  have  a behavior path based on their prior transactions. The association rule technique is well suited for determining the most frequent pattern with confidence, since it provides automatic filtering capabilities. To discover the behavior path of a target e-shopper at time T based on his/her past behavior, the input data should be divided into a conditional part and a consequential part. Association rules are descriptive patterns of the form X?Y, where X and Y are statements regarding the values of attributes of an instance in a database. X is termed the left-hand-side, and is the conditional part of an association rule. Meanwhile, Y is called the right-hand-side, and is the consequent part. The conditional part is composed of the left-hand-side assigned to the consequential part R j represents the association rule about the user specified minimum support and confidence in the following form R j 6 A rule R j  indicates that, if the path of a e-shopper is DD TjsTj 1,1, , ?+? " , then the behavior cluster for that e-shopper is D Tj, at timeT It is necessary to know the degree to which the behavior path of a target e-shopper during 1?s periods beforeT  is similar to the association rule. The cluster path of a target e-shopper, transformed via the SOM, is compared with the association rules derived from other e-shoppers paths, and then the best-matching path is determined. Execution of this 0 if Otherwise    C kTj 154 process requires new measures for calculating the degree of correspondence between the association rules and the behavior path of a target e-shopper. This similarity measure is defined as follows     


1 1  s i i kTj i j SSD                            \(7 Where        1 if RD kTikTi   Si kTj 0 otherwise mj "2,1 11,0 ?= sk " 2?s ni "2,1 The above definition indicates that, if the behavior path of a target e-shopper i is equal to the conditional part of association rule j in the same period, then S j kTi ?,  is equal to one, otherwise is equal to zero. However, even if the similarity measure is high, a choice of the association rule suited to the prediction of the cluster of a target e-shopper at timeT is difficult, since such a rule is not general, given that the support and confidence of the association rule may be remarkably low. Therefore, to assure a good fit between the behavior path of a target e-shopper and the conditional part of the association rule, it is necessary to measure fitness. Fitness is defined as follows Suppose FDij be a degree of the goodness-of-fit between the behavior path i and the association rule j . Then, FDij is defined as follows ConfidenceSupportSDFD jjjiij = ,             \(8 Using the above definition, we can determine the cluster of a target e-shopper at timeT is a consequential part R Tj, of the association rule j with maximum FDij IV.  ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE In this paper, we use Table 3 as example given to illustrate proposed method. The set of product classes given in Table 3 is P={Candy, Can, Milk, Bread, Biscuit}. The transactions of e-shopper CID006 are C June,006 {Candy}, =C May,006 {Can}, =C July,006 {Milk 


Therefore, the dynamic purchase profile of CID006 buying the set of products {Candy, Can, Milk Bread, Biscuit} from May to July may be represented as { }0,0,0,0,1,006 _ C June , { }0,0,0,1,0,006 _ C May and 0,0,1,0,0,006 _ C July . CID016 and CID006 are exactly same as both bought the same products during the same month Therefore, similarly, the transactions of target e-shopper CID016 are =C June,016 {Candy} and =C May,016 {Can The dynamic purchase profile of CID016 buying the products may be represented as 0,0,0,0,1,016 _ C June , { }0,0,0,1,0,016 _ C May TABLE IV.

The association rules are as shown in table 5. The similarities  between the path of e-shopper CID016  and the derived rules are 22016 =SD and 11016 =SD . Therefore, e-shopper CID016 belongs to the ninth cluster at timeT , since the fitness between CID016 and the rules are =FD2016 0.2 and =FD 1 016 0.2001. Therefore, we predict that the products which e-shopper CID016 is likely to buy are Bread, and Biscuit  TABLE V.

In this study, we describe a new approach for mining the changes of e-shopper  purchase behavior over time and discuss solutions to several problems. For predicting e-shoppers purchase behavior, the following concepts are proposed: BP j SDij and FDij . The SOM technique is used to detect the evolving e-shopper purchase sequences as time passes. The purchase sequences are derived from the changes in the cluster number of e-shopper. The sequential purchase patterns over user-specified minimum support and confidence are extracted by using the association rule. Then the sequential purchase patterns are stored in the rule database Finally, we give the example to elaborate the new methodology. The research presented in this paper makes a 155 contribution to mining  e-shoppers purchase behavior basing on transaction data. E-retailer may be able to perform effective  one-to-one marketing campaigns by providing individual target e-shoppers with personalized Product basing on using purchase sequences In the future, some possible extensions to this work are as 


follows. From the results of this study, we know which products target e-shoppers are likely to buy, but we have not yet explored the times at which these purchases are likely to occur. Further research analyzing e-shoppers past purchasing patterns should likewise enable prediction of the most appropriate times. Furthermore, one interesting research extension would be the setting up of a real marketing campaign, in which e-shoppers would be targeted using this methodology, which could then be evaluated with regard to its performance REFERENCES 1]Dhond, Gupta, A., Vadhavkar, S.
