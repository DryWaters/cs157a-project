Precise traffic prediction in a long period in future is of significance for network plan and optimization. In this paper, traffic data in the past several years for a whole province in China and every region are thoroughly studied, and prediction models based on multiplicative seasonal ARIMA are constructed The paper is organized as follows. In section one, time 
series prediction is introduced and several prediction techniques are given including ARIMA and its most complex style-ARIMA with multiplicative seasonal part Section two describes how to apply seasonal ARIMA to construct model and predict traffic, which consists of time series exploration, model identification, parameter estimation and forecasting. In section three, prediction result is analyzed. The cause for prediction error bigger than 10 is analyzed, and the results testified the correctness of the model A  Time Series Prediction and ARIMA Model Let a time series 12 i N x,x  x x 000"\000 
denote observations made at equidistant time interval 0012 h 0012  2h  0012 ih  0012 Nh 00 0 0 000"\000 where i x represents observation made at time  point 0 0012 ih if we adopt 0 0012 as the origin and h as the unit of time. Basically time series prediction can be considered as a modeling issue a model is constructed between the input and the output Then the model can be used to predict the future values 
based on the previous values Among the algorithms deployed in time series prediction, both ARMA \(Auto-Regressive Moving Average 1 an d A R IMA  R eg res s i v e In t e g r ate d M o v i n g A v erag e   2  are used most commonly. ARMA can only be used for linear and stationary time series, while ARIMA can be for non-stationary ones exhibiting homogeneity. While the time series show heterogeneous non-stationary, other algorithms such as ANN \(Artificial Neural Network\ [3 an d   SVM\(Support Vector Machines\ill be adopted[4  In th is  paper, according to the characteristics of traffic time series multiplicative seasonal ARIMA which is a special form of 
ARIMA model is employed Since ARIMA is a model evolving from ARMA.

For those non-stationary time series exhibiting homogeneity, we can stationalize them by differencing operation. Let 1 B 005   denote the differencing operator so that ARIMA model can be written as   d tt B xB 002 003\004 005  5  Where d is an integer representing number of differencing operation. Thus, we can arrive at the conclusion that the model represented by equation \(5\orresponds to assumption that the dth difference of the series can be represented by a stationary ARMA process. We call the process satisfying equation \(5\ an ARIMA \(Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average\ process Similarly, if the non-stationary time series exhibit periodical homogeneity with period s, they can be stationalized by seasonal differencing. The seasonal differencing operator is of the form 1 s s B 005 If a time series is only of seasonal non-stationary, the model can be represented as   sD s P st Q t Bx B 006 007\005=\010   6 where 23 12 3 1 s sss Ps PP B BB B B 007  007 007 007  007 000 7  23 12 3 1 s sss Q s QQ B BB B B 010  010 010 010  010 000  8 If a time series has both trend and seasonal part combining equation \(7\ and \(8\, we can get the following model       SdD S PStQt BB YBB 002 003\004 007\005\005=\010  9 The resulting multiplicative seasonal ARIMA process is of order S p,d,q P,D,Q   II  TRAFFIC  PREDICTION  FOR  A  WHOLE  PROVINCE A  Exploration for the Stationar ity of Daily Traffic per Month There are average daily traffic per month time series for Heilongjiang province as a whole from January, 2005 to June, 2009, totally 54 time point represented by i=1 54 i x 000 The original traffic series is omitted constrained by paper length. It is plotted in Figure 1, and its autocorrelation function is plotted in Figure 2    Figure 1  Average daily traffic per month time series\(2005-1 till 2009-6  Figure 2  Autocorrelation function for {x i  Figure 1 and Figure 2 show that the series for the average daily traffic per month exhibit significant increasing trend. This can also be deduced from that the autocorrelation value is significantly nonzero until lag is 12 B  Stationalization of the original time series by differencing To stationalize a time series, differencing operation aforementioned by 1 dd 011 times is often applied. For example, differencing once means ii+1i y=x x Now differencing the time series above once, and the differenced series i y  is stationary by using the same exploring method aforementioned  Figure 3  Autocorrelation function for i y   Figure 3 shows that when lag is 12 or 24, the autocorrelation coefficients are significantly nonzero, this phenomenon demonstrates that there is seasonality in the time series with period 12. This calculation result is consistent with our general knowledge: the same month in different years will exhibit strong similarity since they have the same season, the same festival and holiday, etc

C  Periodically Differencing the Seasonal Series Difference the derived time series i y  seasonally by the equation ii+12i z=y y The autocorrelation function series for i z  is plotted in Figure 4  Figure 4  The autocorrelation function of i z   From Figure 4, it can be concluded that the derived time series i z  is already stationary. Its autocorrelation function is significantly nonzero only when the lag is 1 or 6 D  the Prediction Process and Resu lt for the Traffic Series of the Province From the three steps aforementioned, it will be appropriate to approximate the average daily traffic per month with ARIMA with trend part and periodical part The software S-Plus developed by MathSoft corporation is used and program is developed by S-language to construct time series model and prediction. Model the time series i z   with 12 p,q P,Q  where every parameter value is no more than 2.

Theoretically, there are several causes for big error: inappropriate model, noises in the training data, and the characteristic of actual data is not the in line with the history data. Next, I will analyze the two regions in Table IV For the region of YCH, the prediction error for the average daily traffic per month on November and December are rather big. Firstly, it will be judged if the actual values are accordant with the history value. The conclusion is negative. The analyzing method is using correlation coefficient [6   The correlation coefficient is a statistical variable to estimate the correlation between two random variables. Let correlation coefficient be denoted by  XY 012 where X and Y are the two random variables  to be studied. The formulation to compute  XY 012 using X and Y based on a sample containing  n points is as follows Where 1 22 11       n ii i nn ii ii xxyy XY xx yy 012        000 000¦\000  11 Firstly examine if the data in January to June in 2008 are likely as the data in the same period in 2009. The correlation coefficient for the two time series is 0 962 and this similarity can also be seen from the Figure 7. This showed that the traffic data in the first half year of 2008 and 2009 obeyed the same rule Forecasting future values by using history value is under the hypothesis: future values obey the same rule with the history values. But explore the values in October till December in 2008 and 2009, and find that they are not similar- the correlation coefficient value is 0.597 From Figure 8, it can also be seen that the two time series have different trend  Figure 5  Comparison of first half year in 2008 and 2009  Figure 6  Comparison of last three monthsr in 2008 and 2009 We can arrive at the conclusion that: the big forecast error for the region of YCH in November and December is because that the actual operation situation in 2009 is not the same as before, not because of inappropriate forecast model or history data with big  noise.The similar situation exists in the region of HG IV  C ONCLUSIONS  Traffic forecast is an important function in   network management. It makes significant sense for network planning and optimization to forecast the traffic in a long period in the future. In this paper, the traffic series for a province of a certain mobile network operator is studied Based on the characteristics exhibited in the traffic series multiplicative seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model \(ARIMA\ is employed to make traffic series prediction. The mean average percentage error \(MAPE\ for one-step ahead prediction is 1.382%, and MAPE for the 6 steps are all less than 6%. The prediction result is of high precision. Furthermore, the cause for the large prediction error in 2 regions is analyzed by using correlation coefficients, and the appropriateness of the model is testified on the opposite aspect. This paper also provides with an effective method by using correlation coefficients to analyze the reason for significant prediction errors which does not happen in time series prediction applications rarely Certainly this correlation coefficient method is mainly useful for time series exhibiting linear characteristic and seasonal feature A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The present work has been supported by 000\003 Chinese Universities Scientific Fund   R EFERENCES  1  S.

an important part in promoting process-thinking across the Group. Lessons learned from the application of Lean Six Sigma also played an Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 3 important part in formulating the strategy for the deployment of BPM The vision for BPM was developed in 2003 and described BPM as a management discipline \(versus a project or technology to align the elements of strategy, business processes and Information Technology \(IT across the Group to drive business performance and manage \(operational 3.3 The Challenges of Deploying BPM in a large Financial Services organization BPM practitioners universally decry the apparent inability of the ?business? to understand and acknowledge the benefits of adopting a formal approach to managing the organization?s critical business processes. There is much in the literature as to the possible reasons why Andrew Spanyi [6] nominates at least three possible reasons Leaders don?t care. Leaders can?t focus. Leaders don?t know how It was the statement ?Leaders don?t know how that provided the needed insight. Perhaps they didn?t want to know and wanted to maintain the status quo Many similarities were observed between the behavior of managers at the Bank and the behavior of major account sales people with whom the author had previously worked. Two categories of sales people were observed: \(1 their social skills and \(2 analytical skills. The category that sold intuitively \(in the experience of the author developing strategy and analyzing market forces they simply wanted to get out, meet people and sell This behavior and the parallels with executives in the Bank was later confirmed by the work of Donald Schon, ?.. the field of management is split into two camps, each of which holds a different view of the nature of professional knowledge.? [9]. Schon differentiates between ?management as a science and ?management as an art The author labeled these categories as reactive and proactive management and regarded the transition from reactive to proactive as essential to the success of BPM deployment 3.4 Reactive versus Proactive Management From the above the core organizational change management issue become changing the culture from reactive management to proactive management managing on purpose The author?s hypothesis is that a reactive culture evolves over a long period of time until it becomes the dominant culture. A reactive culture focuses on outcomes \(especially financial outcomes core competency of a reactive culture is problem solving A proactive culture on the other hand develops a deep understanding of their business. They study industry dynamics and develop objectives and strategies to maximize their strengths and minimize their weaknesses. They understand the levers that drive performance \(and manage risk an agile operating model that can adapt rapidly to change. In other words they manage on purpose A proactive management culture depends on a disciplined approach and is considered by those who prefer a reactive style of management as laborious 


and complex The challenge faced is to transform those who manage reactively to manage on purpose 4. Methodology This paper is based on the direct experience of the author, over a five-year period, in solving a particular business problem; ?How to implement and deploy the principles and practices of BPM in a large financial institution?. The critical issue was one of organizational change management, changing behavior from reactive management to proactive management From a BPM point of view the main objective of the project was to develop a holistic model that could be used as the framework for implementation. The model would need to  Serve as an instrument to communicate the operation of a BPM-driven organization and its benefits  Provide a road-map to guide implementation; and  Serve as an aid to organizational change management There were three important shifts in thinking that occurred during the project 1. A major shift in thinking occurred when we realized that the prevailing holistic models [1][3 were flawed. They were perpetuating the reactive style of management and leading to modeling practices focused on localized optimization 2. It was further apparent that rational argument had little impact on persuading people of the benefits of BPM. [7 3. Finally it was realized that the ?expert engagement model practiced by the Lean Six Sigma area was not working. The business was Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 4 not effectively engaged in ?their? Lean Six Sigma projects. There was little sense of ownership After completion of the project/s the improvement in business efficiency and effectiveness was often not sustained Of the three, making changes to the BPM Lifecycle was the easiest to achieve. The changes were obvious. Insert a Strategy phase between the Optimize stage and the Modeling stage. The model was ?complete? and represented a closed-loop management system  Establish the organization?s objectives and strategy and Align them to their enabling processes. \(At the same time develop the Key Performance Indicators and Key Risk Indicators  Design the processes to realize the strategy. Run Simulation to validate design and metrics  Implement the process; deploy via Standard Operating Procedures \(SOPs workflow engine  Monitor, Analyze and Optimize the processes using management performance dashboards  If the Objectives are not achieved review the strategy and process-design and modify either \(or both It proved more complicated to overcome the problem that ?rational argument was not effective in driving change? until we stumbled on the work Stephen Denning was doing with Business Narrative 7 We attended Stephen?s workshop, read several books and spent hours crafting business narratives Although we didn?t conduct a formal study to 


Although we didn?t conduct a formal study to measure the impact of the stories we did get results We were getting the message through. We could tell from the animated discussion that followed the delivery of a story A ?coaching? engagement model combined with lessons in reflective practice was proposed as an alternative to the ?expert? engagement model. The coaching engagement model is designed to be supportive and not confrontational. Reflective Practice aimed at encouraging adult learning was a logical addition. At the time of writing this paper the coaching? engagement model is still in the process of being developed and was not yet in widespread use In summary the research methodology was based on Action Learning; Reflective Practice; broad and in-depth reading of past and current literature participation in BPM Forums and Blogs and consultation with both academics and private consulting firms 5. The BPM Lifecycle in Practice Implementation of the BPM Lifecycle was supported by an integrated suite of application software as described in section 3.1. Each phase of the lifecycle was represented by models stored in the BPM repository This section reviews each phase of the BPM Lifecycle. For each phase there is a brief description of  The phase  Objectives and benefits of the phase  Phase deliverables  Organizational impact; and  Change management implications 5.1 The Strategy Phase The Strategy Phase represents the beginning of the \(extended Balanced Scorecard models described by Kaplan and Norton [5] were created in this Phase Three model types were used. The first model, the Strategy Map, provided a graphical representation of the four strategic perspectives; financial; customer process and organization capability The second model type was an Objective Model This model linked the objectives defined in each of the strategic perspectives to their respective underlying processes. The model was used to define the Key Performance Indicators \(KPIs defined within in the model The third model was the Balanced Scorecard Model which defined the cause-and-effect relationships between the objectives from each perspective The goal of the Strategy Phase was to facilitate the development of the defined objectives and strategy of the area of the business being considered and align and link this ?strategy? to the underlying enabling processes The deliverables from this phase included 1. A visual representation of the business objectives and strategy 2. A normalized set of objectives with clearly defined metrics 3. The customer value proposition defined within the market segments 4. The underlying enabling business processes Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 5 5. The organizational capabilities that must be developed or refined in order to realize the strategy and support the processes 


strategy and support the processes The key benefit of this phase was the link between strategy and the processes that would deliver the strategy The linking of strategy to process had been ignored at the Bank in the past. Objectives and strategy were carefully developed and refined but in isolation from their enabling processes Once linked to strategy the critical processes could be the focus of management attention. Without this phase there was a danger that developing corporate objectives and strategy was a useless exercise as the output tended to get lost and ignored over time and the benefits of the strategy process were shared by a few senior managers The process of developing a Strategy Map and the other related models was regarded as a lot of effort by the ?reactive managers?. Their tendency was to get on with it? ? ?Give me my targets and let me worry about the rest!? Reactive managers needed to be coached in the benefits of this phase and also the value provided at the completion of this phase ? a clearly defined strategy ?document? that could be used to focus the efforts of the staff in their business area 5.2 The Design Phase A variety of models were used in this phase. They tended to be a combination of models that provided alternating macro views \(value chain views \(dynamic flow models It should be noted that within the standard BPM implementation models modeling in this phase is limited to the execution layers of process. The macro or contextual views are not included There was a tendency during the Business Process Reengineering phase of the early 1990s to model the entire organization. The approach today is based on the concept of a ?wiki? where the process models are developed over a period of time and added to the repository as required then validated and amended by the stakeholders and integrated into the whole via higher-level models A central repository is critical for this ?wikibased? approach to work effectively The objective of the design phase was to document or design the processes that underpin the execution of the strategy There were multiple benefits associated with the ability to view the process in various forms, from both an end-to-end perspective and at a detailed level Different views of the process were considered Characteristics of the process were reviewed as they were documented ? for example, the purpose of the process; the triggers, the business rules and so on The dynamic flow models could be used in simulation mode \(discrete event simulation further insight into the behavior of the process and to test the effectiveness of the defined process metrics The deliverables from this phase were a ?useful set of semantically correct models approved by those responsible for the processes, the business unit leader or the process owner. Having the processes stored in a trusted central repository ensured that all staff had access to the processes In an organization dominated by a culture of reactive management there is rarely a repository of comprehensive process-related documentation. The impact of not having such documentation stored in a trusted central repository is waste The process documentation tends to be in ?hard copy? form and is generally discarded after the completion of the project. The whole process is 


completion of the project. The whole process is repeated six to nine months later when a new project is initiated The impact and cost of not having the organization?s critical processes is very difficult to measure. But the result is a lack of shared knowledge on how the business works and constant re-work to document processes when a new project is initiated On the positive side comprehensive processrelated documentation provides a common definition of process across the business area and is invaluable in facilitating and understanding of the business leading to the proactive management of the business processes The biggest issue faced in this phase was \(and remains the organization. This included mandating the use of the standard modeling tool \(and modeling notation and discouraging the use of drawing tools such as Microsoft Visio and PowerPoint. This was the biggest challenge as staff found it more time consuming to use formal modeling tools where they were constrained by a particular notation There was a tendency to view processes as having one dimension ? the process steps in a flowchart This was a byproduct of using process flowcharting methods. Training in business modeling versus process modeling was required but no formal training was offered The key change management challenge was to instill a culture of process thinking in the organization. The goal was to get to the stage where staff used process models to describe how their Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 business worked instead of using an organization chart  5.3 The Implementation Phase Processes that have been documented, designed or re-engineered are deployed for execution in the Implementation phase. The intent is that the processes are executed as they have been documented. However this is rarely the case where the processes are not automated. These processes are called shadow processes and the practice is very difficult to eliminate Processes can be manually deployed using Standard Operating Procedures \(SOPs governed by the execution of application software eg a Loan Processing system or they can be automated using workflow technology If the processes have been designed to align with the organization?s objectives and strategies then this is the moment of truth. Effectively designed and documented processes provide the foundation for continuous improvement providing their execution is standardized In the case of the Bank there was little standardization of workflow engines and workflow deployment. The integration of process design and process implementation only occurred in a few areas of the business. The application of workflow technology was generally an outcome of individual projects Ideally the deliverables from this phase are robust, efficient processes ? the realization of the organization?s objectives and strategy. However in reality process execution was disconnected from process design In addition to process deployment the process execution environment must effectively expose the 


execution environment must effectively expose the process metrics that are designed in the Strategy Phase and utilized in the Control Phase The key organizational change required to bridge the gap between process design and process execution was closer collaboration between the business and the technology units. The business needed to understand the IT infrastructure required to execute business processes. This required business analysts that had a technical capability On the Technology side, the Enterprise architects needed to work more closely with the business or ideally within the business 5.4 The Control Phase The control phase consists of three sub-phases monitor, analyze and optimize. The control phase requires fairly sophisticated technology to extract the metrics from the process. This phase is also more commonly known as Business Activity Monitoring BAM The monitoring of process performance is extremely important. Once the process is monitored by a suitable tool then it is possible to easily apply and sustain SPC methods to analyze process performance It is essential to establish the degree of stability in a process. Once the process is stable \(under control one can then apply statistical methods to analyse and communicate the behavior of the process. Once the process is stable it is possible to predict the behavior of a process within its control limits \(process capability adjustments to the process structure in order to control the degree of variation exhibited by the process.[10 The objectives of the Control Phase were to monitor the performance, analyze the process behavior \(variation and common causes of variation by applying SPC methods. [10 The key benefit was being able to predict the output of the process within the tolerance of its control limits. A secondary benefit was to illustrate the impact of management intervention on the process performance The deliverables included detailed information about the performance of the process based on the execution of the process itself. The metrics were not theoretically derived but were extracted directly during process execution Management dashboards provided the information to the staff who ?worked on? and worked in? the processes to support them in executing their tasks and serving the end customers Having facts to guide management decisions had an important impact on the organization. The tendency to blame individuals for poor performance diminished. Instead there was a focus on the process How did the process ?allow? this to occur?? [11 This attitude was actively promoted by the BPM support unit There were many more benefits. The link between process performance and achieving business outcomes become clear with a greater emphasis on process management The use of Statistical Process Control is traditionally limited to manufacturing organizations Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 However the penetration of Six Sigma has meant that more organizations are being exposed to its practice In a culture of reactive management training staff 


not to make decisions based on a single data point was critical. They needed to accept the process as it was, ensure it was under control before they started to change the process structures. It was critical that they understood the difference between common and special causes of process variation.[11 6. Discussion and Lessons Learned The extended BPM Lifecycle \(represented by Figure 2 the principles and practices of BPM at the Bank was a logical systematic process. This was not the case The initial focus was process modeling and the development of a business architecture without reference to any implementation framework. This situation was aggravated by a major Sarbanes-Oxley compliance initiative. It was much later that we decided to adopt a BPM framework The framework adopted was based on the standard? BPM framework. The issues of governance and ownership and the disconnect between strategy and their corresponding processes were known. These issues and their impact were discussed and the ?solution? of the extended BPM Lifecycle evolved However the BPM Lifecycle, as a framework for the deployment of BPM is now well understood. It can be effectively used by the Bank \(and other organizations The first research question: ?How effective and practical are the popular holistic BPM models in guiding the deployment and implementation of BPM can now be answered. Without the addition of the Strategy Phase we were at significant risk of promoting the practices of reactive management by not considering processes in a global and strategic context The issue of organizational change management addressed by the extended BPM Lifecycle focused on changing the culture from reactive management to proactive management. This was \(and still is critical issue. The use of the BPM framework to draw attention to this behavior and combined with business narrative were interventions that achieved some success Business narrative was used to overcome the tendency to use rational argument as the only method to encourage change. However Stephen Denning [7 describes the use of different story structures to support the entire deployment lifecycle.  The use of additional story types in this way has promise and is to be explored later The nature of engagement between the BPM support unit and the business received a lot of attention. It became clear that an ?expert? engagement model was not effective. Although it did produce results these results were not sustained and the business never really ?owned? their business processes An engagement model based on executive coaching and reflective practice showed more promise and was welcomed by the business units. It was a less confronting model based on collaboration and the attitude that the BPM unit was part of the business not a separate area An important issue is the provision of work-place training of BPM staff in executive coaching and reflective practice. This will be critical to the success of the ?coaching? engagement model. The most appropriate method is probably to use coaching and reflective practice to train the BPM coaches. This is an area that needs further research and attention The Strategy Phase was a significant addition to 


The Strategy Phase was a significant addition to the lifecycle. However the business initially regarded the use of models to document strategy as ?a lot of effort?. This reaction was no surprise in the context of reactive management. Reactive managers tend not to be comfortable with analysis Once the sense of ?effort? was overcome they tended to enjoy the process and found it very stimulating and useful. They also had a sense of ownership of their strategy as they have helped to formulate it. They understood a great deal more about how their business worked than they did before participating in the process In the Modeling Phase we learned that it is extremely important to ensure that the users have a positive experience in using a more sophisticated process modeling tool. Training in the use of the tool as well as training in modeling business processes is required. This is equally true for both business and technical staff The models need to be simple and staff need to be encouraged to provide high level models such as value chains to provide a context for the dynamic flow models The key lesson learned is that the processes must be useful to the business if they are to be maintained The intent is to make the process documentation indispensible to the managers as an aid to managing their business. This is achieved by the additional information recorded with the objects that make up the models \(object attributes document the processes must have the ability to maintain attributes that are used to describe the Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 process and provide details on each aspect of the process In the Implementation Phase simply having application software that is capable of automating the business processes is not enough. Business representatives need to understand the capability of technology to deploy and automate processes Technology staff need understand business sufficiently to provide them with an awareness of the possibilities that can be derived from process automation and the emerging technology of SOA Finally in the Control Phase implementing a process and business monitoring tool is a complex undertaking. There is a very steep learning curve involved in all aspects from installation configuration, testing and training staff in the use and analysis of the tool It is critical to clearly communicate how each of the Key Performance Indicators \(KPIs calculated and how they should be interpreted and used. The users must trust what they see so it is important to have a transparent validation process in place that can be used to demonstrate the accuracy of the measurements and results. Be prepared for rapid acceptance and understanding from the business and requests for advanced features. This behavior may reflect the penchant of reactive managers to solve problems There are many areas for further research. It would be interesting to profile managers using Kolb?s Learning Style Inventory [12]. This would provide further insight into the characteristics of reactive versus proactive managers and provide alternatives for intervention strategies. It is possible that a balance of reactive management and proactive management is likely to be more effective than a single management style 


style 7. Conclusion This paper has illustrated the use of a holistic framework, the BPM Lifecycle and its use in the deployment of business process management \(as a management discipline financial services organization The paper demonstrates that the commonly used BPM models omit two key elements: \(1 Phase and \(2 Governance Ownership and Accountability. Without the link to strategy organizations will tend to focus on local process optimization of process to the detriment of the performance of the end-to-end processes A visionary, competitive strategy that is not linked to operational processes cannot be implemented [4 Effective process management is not possible without appropriate governance and ownership Suitably qualified, experienced and trained staff are required for the role of Process Owner. Their authority to modify or approve modifications must be derived from corporate policy - the formal delegated authority to modify a process The paper argues that the introduction of BPM is further complicated in an organization dominated by reactive-style? managers. Converting these managers to ?proactive-style? managers is a major organizational change management imperative Furthermore these managers aren?t persuaded by rational argument. More effective approaches such as the use of business narrative must be used to initiate and accelerate the required change Finally an ?expert? engagement model is not effective for deploying BPM. Business executives and their staff require coaching in the application of BPM principles and practices assisted by training in Reflective Practice to internalize the learning The discipline of BPM is extending rapidly assisted by technology advances. The integration of business rules engines into process modeling tools holds the promise of ?agile processes? and redefines the role of risk managers. [13 The extended BPM lifecycle is not specific to the financial services industry but could be applied to other industries. It provides a very high level framework. The underlying elements can be adapted to include evolving aspects of BPM including the definition, testing and deployment of business rules and the documentation and management of technology related elements such as web services The journey at the Bank is not complete by any means. It is merely the ?end of the beginning?. The major aggravating factor is scale. There are a large number of people, business units and a complex technology platform and an ever changing market environment However the modified and extended BPM Lifecycle has proved to be a ?useful model? to support the introduction and deployment of business process management at the Bank 8.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
