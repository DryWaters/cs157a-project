An E-Commerce Trust Model Based on Web Service  Bin Liu School of Mathematics and Computer Science Guizhou Normal University Guiyang, China gznuliubin@gmail.com Renjin Zhang School of Mathematics and Computer Science Guizhou Normal University Guiyang, China rj_zhmail@163.com   Abstract The existence of malicious service provider could damage the correctness and availability of e-commerce systems based on web service. So a new authentic trust model for web 
service e-commerce is present in this paper.  It says that the trust for web service e-commerce is comprised of the trust degree of service business and the trust degree of customer evaluation During trust degree computing, service time, business sum and service result should be thought about. In additional, we should consider service object and trust degree of service business when computing the trust degree of customer evaluation. Simulation experimental results show that the new trust Model can distinguish between normal service and malicious service Especially, it's an effective action to identify that the business is 
just a small sum business for upgrade trust value with a big sum business for cheat and trust value's upgrade from group cheat Keywords- e-commerce; trust model; web service I  024  Lc-\024 Internet 030T\035\003,X\024S"Ø\024h*¸\002»\004é\004¿,X*Û#\017C^\0359C^/è\003 024‘5%4∞\001ƒ\004é\004¿\003·\004ôEÓEõ5%4∞\021`\027‰AÃ\017V##?ú5%NI\002»\032Ñ\007m\011 021v\002»\035πKŸC\030\033m\002»\?ò\025˚,X\004_\026ô\002»5‡\003ËAå\016Ó,X*¸\030\013 026„Aö\010\0045%\003ﬁC\001\(=,X1T\011\\025ø\031K6—4≠\033π\024\014*Û#\017\023˙\0359\034»\016Ó\005 007˝\002»\014¥!8C^\0359C^\016Ó,X\004éE›\030ΩE≠/°\011\016\007ˇ\004b\004Ù4≥\037ı\024„,X\033Ñ\015_C\001 033ç\024„\001ƒ\(M\007ˇ\034\003\014¸\004é\004¿*Û#\0178V\017#\010t\025ø\002»*Û#\017\011_\010o\016r\016˚\002»6 011 XK∆\034[\033 K Lc\004\0374˝-¡,X\004û\016˝\002»EÓEõ5%\003 E C\001\035§\004o\013\032\012ï\012`\034·\010u\023∆\027‰\004\016\003‘/°\003·JÌ,XE›\030Ω\001ƒ\011∫\016Í\002»+\011\021$\013\032 010u,XN≤EÛ\011•\022\\034»Eô\031K,X\033ç\024„9ã\011™\016˚G£,X\013\032\012 012`\034·\010u\005µ\026C\002»\016ÿ\\004_\010u\002»\0043\005ó\005SE≠/°\033Ñ\015_,XC\001

knowledge contribution, sharing, and creation. This leads to our third hypothesis  H3: An online community member?s satisfaction with the community is positively related to his/her continuance intention of knowledge creation  2.3. Performance expectancy and continuance intention of knowledge creation  In addition to perceived identity verification performance expectancy may also affect both members? satisfaction and continuance intention. As previously noted, both of them refer to individuals post-consumption variables [5] and may motivate an individual to participate in knowledge creation in a community?while performance expectancy represents an extrinsic benefit, PIV is associated with an intrinsic benefit. On the other hand, performance expectancy has been recognized by prior work [19, 38] as a strong predicator of intention. We extend CDT \(cognitive dissonance theory  member of a community has, indicating she may experience more cognitive consonance about the perceived performance of the community than those with less PIV, the more performance expectancy the member has. This leads to the fourth hypothesis Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 3  H4: An online community member?s perceived identity verification is positively related to his/her performance expectancy  In this study, drawing on both expectationconfirmation theory \(ECT  al?s [38] empirical study, ex post performance expectancy is used for representing post-consumption expectation in the proposed IS continuance model While TAM found perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use as salient beliefs influencing IS acceptance behaviors across a broad range of end-user computing technologies [11], Compeau and Higgins [10] found that performance expectance positively influences IS end users? affect. IS users? post-acceptance affect satisfaction performance expectancy. This leads to the fifth hypothesis  H5: An online community member?s performance expectancy is positively related to his/her satisfaction with the community  There are two reasons that performance expectancy may affect continuance intention. First, enhanced performance is instrumental in achieving various rewards that are extrinsic to the task contexts, such as promotions or monetary gains. IS use \(such as participation in an online community as a means to that end. Second, as previously noted while there are many similarities between performance expectancy \(i.e. ex post expectation 10, 11], the former exerts more influence on behavioral intention than the latter [38]. Thus  H6: An online community member?s performance expectancy is positively related to his/her continuance intention of knowledge creation  2.4. The moderating role of trust in continuance intention of knowledge creation  


Finally, in addition to the perceived identity verification and performance expectancy, trust also plays a central role in a frank exchange of views knowledge contribution [39], and integration of members? expertise in a software development team 37]. This view about trust is appropriate for knowledge creation in the context of an online community because achieving knowledge creation depends not only on the knowledge contributions of other members \(i.e. acquiring useful knowledge also on the decisions made about how the foregoing knowledge is combined \(i.e. the conversion of other members? knowledge into new knowledge  Prior work has recognized that individuals? belief and behavior are contingent on trust in the context of a online community, such as electronic networks of practice [39] and the development of open source software [31]. Despite this, how trust affects the relationships between performance expectancy and continuance intention of knowledge creation remains unkown. To fill this gap, this study explores how trust in terms of affective trust and cognitive trust [25 moderates the foregoing relationships. Affective trust stems from the emotional attachment between a trustor and a trust target and may, therefore, play a significant role in members? psychological and emotional reasons for participating in, and contributing to an online community [25 With strong affective trust, members believe that they may derive more social benefits from their perceived identity verification because the foregoing verification or interpersonal congruence is trustworthy and both harmonious interaction and creative performance are assured [35]. Conversely, when affective trust is weak, individuals can not sure whether the existing perceived identity verification is true, even though it is high. Under such conditions members? motivation decreases because they believe that they may not receive social benefits derived from reciprocal relationships \(or reciprocal supportiveness Thus  H7a: An online community member?s affective trust moderates the relationships between his/her perceived identity verification and continuance intention  Cognitive trust relies on a rational assessment of the target by the trustor [25] and such assessments may include both the evaluation of the competence of the trust target and the probability of opportunistic behavior by the target. In the context of open source software development, high cognitive trust tends to lead to reputation motivations, because the effectiveness of the software development depends largely on the inputs of other developers [31 When a member has high cognitive trust in other members, he believes that he may derive more social benefits from participating in the KM activities in the community because of a sense of mutual indebtedness Thus, it is worthwhile to devote his time and efforts to KM activities in the community?e.g. the conversion from other members? knowledge to his own knowledge or knowledge contribution, so that he may reciprocate the benefits he receive from others, ensuring ongoing supportive exchanges [39]. Conversely, when cognitive Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 4 trust is low, individuals are not willing to waste an effort to join the community because he thinks that he is not likely to acquire useful knowledge from the community, leading to low performance expectancy 


community, leading to low performance expectancy Thus  H7b: An online community member?s cognitive trust moderates the relationships between his/her performance expectancy and continuance intention   3. Method, data analysis, and results  3.1. Data collection  We tested the hypotheses using primary survey data collected from two famous online communities Baidu \(at zhidao.baidu.com at tw.knowledge.yahoo.com launched on the Web in 2005 and is located in China while the latter was established in 2004 and its members mainly come from Taiwan. Both communities fall into the category of ?a community of common interest or information exchange? [2 Although the establishment time of both of the foregoing communities is not long, the population of them is growing at a fast rate. The possible reason is that these communities aim to cover a diverse range of issues so that members can either acquire knowledge or they may have an exchange of views about a specific subject that they are interested to know Examining two communities that belong to different countries may extend the generalizability of the findings because we explore how continuance intention of knowledge creation is affected by PIV or performance expectancy under different conditions Table 1 lists the demographic profile of the respondents. The members of Baidu and Yahoo knowledge+ returned 245 and 250 questionnaires respectively to the authors. Responses with incomplete data were eliminated from further analysis. Thus, 213 and 216 useful responses from Baidu \(China Yahoo knowledge+ \(Taiwan the data analysis. Both of Baidu and Yahoo knowledge+ are dominated by man. The average age of Baidu is lower than that of Yahoo knowledge Respondents from both communities are well educated?approximately 60% in Yahoo knowledge and more than 70% in Baidu have college degrees, and they have significant Internet experience \(more than 5 years for both communities both communities have been members of their respective communities for a considerable amount of time \(one year for Baidu and 1.5 years for Yahoo knowledge Baidu and Yahoo were 5 hrs/week and 7 hrs/week respectively. Given the samples are active members and have experience in knowledge creation, they are suitable to answer the questionnaire Table 1.

The only variable that makes a significant difference is the continuance intention of knowledge creation, which implies, not surprisingly, that the more active members are more likely to respond earlier Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 5  3.2. Operationizational of key constructs  Survey items are listed in Appendix. The items of the questionnaire were adapted from measures that had been validated by related studies, and these items have been modified to fit in with the context of this study Specifically, two salient antecedents of continuance intention--perceived identity verification and performance expectancy, were developed based on relevant studies [23, 39]. Regarding perceived identity verification, following Kuhn and McPartland [20], we used a modified Twenty Statements Test \(TST capture salient identities of a community member. The TST acknowledges that an individual can have multiple identities and different identities may become dominant in different contexts. In addition, consistent with prior work [23], the number of items that we used to measure TST have been reduced from 20 to 5 to minimize the effects of fatigue. After completing the TST, the respondents were asked to rate their perception, in terms of one item as shown in Appendix of other community members? verification of the foregoing five identities. Each solicited identity was measured by the item, resulting in 5 items in total. The results of factor analysis indicate that only the first two identity load on its corresponding factor. The possible reason is that these identities are salient for the subjects Consequently, two items were used to measure an individual?s PIV While the moderating variables \(i.e. affective trust and cognitive trust Gosain [31], with the items modified to fit this study?s context, the items measuring satisfaction were adapted from Ma and Agarwal [23]. Finally, the dependent variables?continuance intention of knowledge creation, were adapted from prior work [4, 6] and were altered to fit the online community context. We created one construct for continuance intention of knowledge creation by forming a second-order construct from a scale measuring four types of knowledge creation modes, i.e. Socialization, Externalization, Combination Internalization, or SECI model [1, 26]. The items in the questionnaire were measured using five-point scales anchored from ?strongly disagree? to ?strongly agree Appendix lists the questionnaire items  4. Analysis  4.1. Measurement model  PLS was used because it allows latent variables to 


PLS was used because it allows latent variables to be modeled either as formative or reflective indicators 8] as was the case with our data, and it places minimal demands on variable distributions. A few of our variables were not strictly normal distributed, which may cause problems provided factor-based covariance approaches \(such as LISREL and AMOS  This analysis of this study was performed using PLSGraph Version 3.00 Following recommended two-stage analytical procedures [8], we first validated the measurement model and then examined the structural relationships Because our model contains one second-order construct \(i.e. continuance intention of knowledge creation construct using factor scores for the first-order constructs [9 To validate our measurement model, three types of validity were examined?content validity, convergent validity, and discriminant validity. Content validity was established by ensuring that the measurement items are consistent with the extant literature. This was done by both interviewing senior members of community and pilot-testing the questionnaire Regarding convergent validity, we examined both composite reliability and average variance extracted AVE  8], 0.7 refers to the reliability threshold of a construct As indicated in Table 2, the composite reliability values of Yahoo knowledge+ range from 0.719 to 0.89 while those of Baidu range between 0.734 and 0.864 For the AVE of a measure, a score of 0.5 is acceptable 14]. All our measures of AVE are greater than 0.5 which indicates acceptability. Finally, the discriminant validity of our instrument was validated by assessing the square root of AVE as suggested by Fornel and Larcker [14]. The discriminant validity is also acceptable because the square root of the AVE for each construct is greater than the levels of correlations involving the construct. Further, the results of the interconstruct correlations demonstrate that each construct shares larger variance with its own measures than with other measures  4.2. Structural model  Given the acceptable validity of our measurement model, PLS was used for examining the proposed hypotheses. We describe the results in the following sequence?the impact of PIV on satisfaction and continuance intention of knowledge creation \(H1-H3 the influence of performance expectancy on satisfaction and continuance intention of knowledge creation, the relationships between PIV and performance expectancy \(H4-H6 role of trust in continuance intention \(H7 and H8 As indicated in Table 4, H1 and H3 are supported as expected, whereas H2 is not supported surprisingly Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 Regarding the relationship between PIV and continuance intention of knowledge creation, the path coefficients of Baidu and Yahoo knowledge+ are 0.179\(p&lt;0.01 p&lt;0.01 the path between satisfaction and continuance intention of Baidu is 0.493\(p&lt;0.001 knowledge+ is 0.37\(p&lt;0.001 relationship between PIV and satisfaction, the?of Baidu is not significant \(0.056 Yahoo knowledge+ \(-0.012 While H5 and H6 are supported as expected, the findings of H4 are inconsistent?H4 is supported in the

To make rigorously comparisons across subgroups, we calculated t-statistics to evaluate the differences between path coefficients of the two subgroups From Table 2, surprisingly, neither H7 nor H8 is supported. Regarding affective trust, none of the relations is contingent on it. On the other hand, while three relations of Baidu \(i.e. PIV and continuance intention, PIV and satisfaction, PIV and performance expectancy relation \(PIV and continuance intention knowledge+ is contingent on cognitive trust.

Addressing common method variance  Common method variance \(CMV potential threat to internal validity, especially to research using surveys that collect responses in a single setting. To deal with CMV, we used the following approaches. First, we collected data in two separate stages?with dependent and independent variables measurement separated in time. Second, we used factor analysis to examine the CMV in the data set According to Harman?s one-factor test, CMV is high provided that a single factor accounts for a majority of covariance in the independent and dependent variables Our factor analysis did not detect such a single factor explaining a majority of the covariance. Using the above methods, we believe that CMV is unlikely to occur in this study  5. Discussion and implications  5.1. Discussion  Overall, our findings provide strong empirical support for the proposed theoretical model. Three important conclusions can be drawn from this study First, in both communities, performance expectancy plays a key role in members? satisfaction and knowledge creation behavior. This result extends EDT and Bhattacherjee?s [5] study by arguing that members? performance expectancy serves as a salient post-consumption variable, which affects the continuance intention of knowledge creation in online communities. While most EDT-related studies [5, 6 contended that IS users? perceived usefulness influences their behavior, this study argues that individuals? performance expectancy represents an alternative way of affecting their behavior because it attempts to explain individuals? behavior from the perspective of social cognition?including both performance and personal outcome expectations [3, 10 38], although more rigorous studies are needed to 


38], although more rigorous studies are needed to generalize this argument Second, in addition to members? performance expectancy, our findings of the relationships between PIV and continuance intention are somewhat interesting. As shown in Table 4, our results are consistent with the findings of Ma and Agarwal [23 PIV is positively associated with continuance intention However, surprisingly our findings indicate that PIV affects satisfaction indirectly through performance expectancy rather than directly in Baidu community while satisfaction is not influenced by PIV in Yahoo knowledge+ community. This implies that members behavior in online communities may vary according to their country of origin or culture. Further, while Ma and Agarwal?s [23] empirical study showed that PIV plays a significant role in satisfaction, our findings extend this by arguing that when PIV and performance expectancy are being considered simultaneously for their influence on satisfaction, performance expectancy exerts more influence on satisfaction than PIV Finally, regarding the moderating effect of trust on members? behavior, although our hypotheses are not supported, cognitive trust does moderate some relationships \(as shown in Table 4 relationships between PIV and continuance intention in both communities, and two other relationships in Baidu--PIV and satisfaction, PIV and performance expectancy. The implications of the above findings are two-fold. First, our findings suggest that individuals behavior in the context of a loosely-knit community is affected more by the trust based on rational assessment of the target by the trustor \(i.e. cognitive trust the emotional attachment between a trustor and a trust target \(i.e. affective trust moderating effect of cognitive trust between PIV and continuance intention is inconsistent; whereas the Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 foregoing relationship is negatively moderated by cognitive trust in Yahoo knowledge+ community \(T=2.021, p&lt;0.05 moderates the above relationships \(T= 2.619, p&lt;0.01 This implies it is likely that other salient factors \(such as culture and individuals? behavior. Future study may focus on addressing this problem  5.2. Limitations and future study  This study has three limitations. First, an ideal empirical design for assessing EDT would be a longitudinal comparison between individuals? preadoption and post-adoption perceptions, because a cross-sectional study usually makes it difficult for faithfully capturing the complex, dynamic interrelations between salient variables of individuals belief \(or attitude study may emphasize temporal comparisons such as changes in performance expectancy and PIV across acceptance and continuance phases. Second, although the theories used in this study are based on IS-related theories, the proposed model does not contain IT artifact, which differentiates our model from other types of community \(offline not assess the impact of culture on members knowledge creation behavior because people from China and Taiwan have somewhat similar culture Future study may focus on this issue  5.3. Contributions  


 The contributions of this study are three-fold. First by testing the proposed theory in two representative but different online communities, we are confident that the key concept?perceived identity verification and performance expectancy?can be applied to other online communities focused on information-exchange Second, the motivation of participating online communities was examined from two different but complementary perspectives. While performance expectancy refers to members? rational thought of participating in an online community?i.e. outcome expectations, PIV improves members? motivation of knowledge creation from an emotional perspective i.e. strong PIV indicates higher interpersonal congruence, which in turn fosters group interaction and creative performance [23]. Therefore, we believe that the results deepen our understanding of how individuals? continuance intention of knowledge creation can be facilitated by the foregoing factors Finally, because this study is based on sound theories such as EDT, social cognitive theory, and selfverification theory, our findings not only extend EDT influence, but also can be applied to a variety of similar contexts  6.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
