carry on the management and the operation. It has greatly improved the ability of producing, collecting, storing and processing data. Under such a background, people urgently need new computing technology and tools to excavate the knowledge contained in database, which guides technological decision and strengthens the competitiveness of enterprises Data mining has emerged as a means for identifying patterns and trends from a large amount of data [1 major reason that data mining has attracted a great deal of attention in the information industry in recent years is due to the wide availability of huge amounts of data and the imminent need for turning such data into useful information 
and knowledge. Data mining can be viewed as a result of the natural evolution of information technology The paper is organized as follows. The definition, process and techniques of data mining are introduced in section 2 The design and implement of online bookstore is introduced in section 3. In section 4, association rules mining and Apriori Algorithm is introduced and experiments are conducted. The conclusions are discussed in Section 5 II  D ATA M ININ G  T HEO R Y  A  Def in it ion of Data Mining 
Simply stated, data mining refers to extracting or 223mining\224 knowledge from large amounts of data D ata  mining is the process of discovering actionable information from large sets of data. It uses mathematical analysis to derive patterns and trends that exist in data. Typically, these patterns cannot be discovered by traditional data exploration because the relationships are too complex or because there is too much data These patterns and trends can be collected and defined as a data mining model. Mining models can be applied to specific business scenarios, such as  Forecasting sales 
 Targeting mailings toward specific customers  Determining which products are likely to be sold together B  Data Mining Process Building a mining model is part of a larger process that includes everything from asking questions about the data and creating a model to answer those questions, to deploying the model into a working environment. This process can be defined by using the following six basic steps  Defining the Problem  Preparing Data  Exploring Data  
Building Models  Exploring and Validating Models  Deploying and Updating Models The following Figure 1 describes the relationships between each step in the process, and the technologies in Microsoft SQL Server that can be used to complete each step Although the process illustrated in the diagram is circular each step does not necessarily lead directly to the next step Creating a data mining model is a dynamic and iterative process. After exploring the data, one may find that the data is insufficient to create the appropriate mining models, and that one therefore have to look for more data. Alternatively 
you may build several models and then realize that the models do not adequately answer the problem you defined and that you therefore must redefine the problem. You may have to update the models after they have been deployed because more data has become available. Each step in the process might need to be repeated many times in order to create a good model  2010 International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling \(ICCASM 2010 V12-300 C 9 78 1 42 4 4 7 237 6   2 6  0 0  201 0 I E EE

The function of the data warehouse is to store the historical data of an organization in an integrated manner that reflects the various facets of the organization and business A three-stage data-warehousing development process is summarized through the following basic steps 1\ Modeling In simple terms, to take the time to understand business processes, the information requirements of these processes, and the decisions that are currently made within processes 2\ Building To establish requirements for tools that suit the types of decision support necessary for the targeted business process; to create a data model that helps further define information requirements; to decompose problems into data specifications and the actual data store, which will in its final form, represent either a data mart or a more comprehensive data warehouse 3\ Deploying To implement, relatively early in the overall process, the nature of the data to be warehoused and the various business intelligence tools to be employed; to begin by training users. The deploy stage explicitly contains a time during which users explore both the repository \(to understand data that are and should be available\d early versions of the actual data warehouse. This can lead to an evolution of the data warehouse, which involves adding more data, extending historical periods, or returning to the build stage to expand the scope of the data warehouse through a data model III  D ESIG N AND I MPLEM ENT OF O NLI NE B OO KSTORE B ASED ON ASP  N ET  An o nlin e bookstore is formed by the front and back business subsystem.

 Figure 2    System overall design flowchart De fi nition 1 Let I ={I 1 I 2 205  I m be a set of m distinct attributes, also called literals. Let D be a database, where each record T has a unique identifier, and contains a set of items such that T I An ass o ciation rule is an implication of the form X Y, wher e X, Y I, ar e sets o f items called itemsets, and XY Here, X is ca lled antecedent, and Y consequent Two important measures for association rules, support \(S and confidence \(C\, can be defined as follows Definition 2 The support \(S\f an association rule is the ratio \(in percent\f the records that contain XY to the  total number of records in the database    XY SX Y PX Y D  1 Therefore, if we say that the support of a rule is 5% then it means that 5% of the total records contain X Y. Support is the statistical significance of an association rule. Grocery store managers probably would not be concerned about how peanut butter and bread are related if less than 5% of store transactions have this combination of purchases. While a high support is often desirable for association rules, this is not always the case. For example, if we were using association rules to predict the failure of telecommunications switching nodes based on what set of events occur prior to failure, even if these events do not occur very frequently association rules showing this relationship would still be important Definition 3 For a given number of records, confidence C\ is the ratio \(in percent\of the number of records that contain X Y to the number of records that contain X     XY CX Y PY X X 2 Thus, if we say that a rule has a confidence of 85%, it means that 85% of the records containing X also contain Y The confidence of a rule indicates the degree of correlation in the dataset between X and Y. Confidence is a measure of a rule\222s strength. Often a large confidence is required for association rules. If a set of events occur a small percentage of the time before a switch failure or if a product is purchased only very rarely with peanut butter, these relationships may not be of much use for management Definition 4 The form of  mining rule is     sup  P X c ustom er W Q X Y buys X Z port confidence  In ab ov e form X i s the keyword of relationship \223customer\224 P and Q ar e p redicate variables W  Y and  Z are Objec t  variables and their values are in the range of customer X  For  example, a rule of age \(X, \22320\20529\224 in co me \(X 22340000\20550000\224 buy s \( X, \223economic books\224 \[2, 60  can tell us that a customer who is 20 years old and has a revenue between 40,000 to 50,000 most probably chooses economic books \( confidence is 60 B  Ap r iori Algorithm The Apr i ori algorithm developed by  achievement in the history of mining associa  is by far the most well-known association rule algorithm The Apriori algorithm has two steps, During the first step L k-1 is jo ined with itself to obtain C k In th e seco nd step apriori_gen\(\ deletes all itemsets from the join result, which have some \(k-1\subset that is not in L k1 Then, it returns t he remaining large k-itemsets  Algorithm : Apriori // To search all frequent itemsets Input: Database, D, of transactions; minimum support threshold, min_sup Output: L, frequent itemsets in D Method 1\ L 1 l a rgel-itemsets 2\ FOR{k=2; L k-1 k  DO BEGIN 3\ C k ap r iori-gen \( L k-1 mi n_ sup C k is th e ca ndidate set of k elem e nts 4\l transactions t D DO BEGIN  s ca n D for counts 5\    C t subset\( C k t  ge t the subsets of t that are candidates 6\    FOR all candidates c C t DO 7 c. co unt 8\  END 9\  L k c C k c c ount min_sup 10 11\nswer=U k L k  Yes Regist ered users  Index pag e  To pick o ut and pu rchase Put selected g o ods into shopping cart To co n f irm quantity Go to cas h desk  To reg ister  T o Log in  Con f irm the order and submit Fi ll i n personal detailed information Fi nish sho pping No 2010 International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling \(ICCASM 2010 V12-302

mining procedures. Our motivation in this study is to utilize the redundancy for extracting algorithm of fuzzy association rules IV. IMPROVEMENT OF APRIORI ALGORITHM BASED ON If max{Conf\(Z ? y X ? y max{CF\(Z ? y X ? y ZEQ Proof From the assumption, there exist P E Q that satisfY Con/\(P ? y X ? Y P ? y 0: CF\(X ? Y CF\(X ? y P ? Y Z ? V ZEQ 70 The necessary point in the Apriori algorithm for extracting association rules is to generate the frequent item sets efficiently Though the confidence of the association rules are calculated mally after all decision of frequent itemsets in traditional Apriori algorithm, the basic idea of our proposal is that the confidence of the rule can be calculated after each step A3 in the Apriori algorithm and used for pruning the redundant itemsets. The issue is to decide which itemset should be pruned utilizing the confidence information. Then we define "strong redundant rule" and "strong redundant itemset Confidence 1.0 2 3 4 The number of items Figure 2. Conceptual Diagram of Pruning Method Definition 2: Let X ? Y be a fuzzy association rule, where X and Yare fuzzy item sets. Let Q be Q = 2 x - X If min\(ConJ\(Z ?Y X ?Y ZEQ X ? Y strong redundant rule Let k-rule denote the rule that has k attributes\(items consequent part, and the "subset rule" denote that itemset corresponding to the rule is subset of the item set of larger rule and the consequent parts of both rules are the same set Definition 3: Let Z be a fuzzy itemset that has k items\( k>2 When all the k-rules generated from Z are strong redundant, we call the itemset Z strong redundant itemset Fig.2 shows the concept of strong redundant rule and strong redundant itemset. Since the Apriori algorithm generates the candidate itemsets in tum from l-itemsets, the pruning based 


on the redundancy should be performed simultaneously In addition to the basic Apriori algorithm, the following procedures are employed for k> I as A4 confidence of k-rule based on Lk and Lk.j AS The concept of the procedure is that the confidence value of rule should increase by increasing the number of antecedent items. In other words, the procedure is based on valid heuristics that the combination of items in antecedent part which deteriorates the confidence value will become redundant in the following iterations. We can expect reduction of computational time and redundant rules pruning by the additional procedures It should be noted that the confidence calculation in each iteration does not lead to the increase of overall calculation time in association rules mining v. NUMERICAL EXAMPLES We develop the fuzzy mining system based on the redundancy pruning and evaluate the proposed algorithms through numerical examples. We apply the system to "abalone data" available from the vcr Machine Learning Repository[7 The abalone data set consists of 4177 measured data with 1 nominal attribute and 8 continuous attributes as shown in 71 Table. I. In the experiments, the nominal attribute is transformed to the continuous attribute. Table 2\(a statistics and the fuzzy partition information of attributes are summarized in Table 2\(b wider than the actual data distribution for performance evaluation. The fuzzy partition example is shown in Fig.3. We use two types of fuzzy sets with different width, i.e. triangle type and trapezoid type. Although it is better to use the factor such as "interesting" for pruning the derived rules in addition we apply the native association rule extraction for proposed algorithm evaluation.

The number of deleted rules by the proposed algorithm Fig.5 shows the results of reduction of itemsets by the proposed algorithm. We can see that fair itemsets are pruned by the proposed method. Fig.6 shows the number of extracted rules by the conventional Apriori algorithm. Many redundant rules are extracted as well as the necessary non-redundant rules Our issue is to restrain the extraction of redundant rules. Fig.7 shows the results of the number of deleted rules by the proposed algorithm. Some redundant rules are deleted simultaneously along with frequent itemsets extraction However, since a few non-redundant rules are also unexpectedly deleted at the lower threshold value of minimal confidence, we have to investigate further about heuristics, i.e strong redundant itemsts and relation of threshold values. It should be noted that the number of deleted rules has less dependence on the minimal confidence These results are promising in terms of computational time and redundant rules pruning. However, the improvement is limited in terms of computational time. We consider that the performance of the proposed method must be improved by applying the output field specification method[17]. We expect that the number of pruned rules becomes larger based on the specifications. Moreover, the other measures to prevent redundant rules extraction in fuzzy association rules mining 


could be applied as well as the proposed algorithm VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we proposed a basic algorithm based on the Apriori algorithm for rule extraction utilizing redundancy of the extracted rules, in order to improve the efficiency of the association rules mining and to prune the redundant rules extracted. We also proved the redundancy defmition of the rule based on the CF\(certainty factor algorithm was evaluated through numerical experiments using benchmark data, "Abalone". From the results, the method was found to be promising in terms of computational time and redundant rule pruning. Our future plan includes sophistication of the proposed algorithm, application to the huge data mining problem, and further improvement of fuzzy association rules mining REFERENCES I] R.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK This paper first discusses the theory of foundations and association rules and presents an association rules mining algorithm, namely, FP-growth algorithm. And then we propose an improved algorithm IFP-growth based on many association rules mining algorithms. At last we implement the algorithm we propose and compare it with algorithm FPgrowth algorithm. The experimental evaluation demonstrates its scalability is much better than algorithm FP-growth 177 Now, lets forecast something we want to do someday Firstly, we would parallelize our algorithm, because data mining needs massive computation, and a parallelable environment could high improve the performance of the algorithm; Secondly, we would apply our algorithm on much more datasets and study the run performance; At last, we would study the performance when the algorithm deal with other kinds of association rules  REFERENCES 1] S.

Pruning experiences at support 0.25  V. DISCUSSION AND CHALLENGES It is important to discuss the technique presented here with focus on the purpose the technique pursues:  to produce semantic recommendation The reader should have noticed that the algorithm presented 


relies strongly on "choice". For instance, the algorithm chooses ears in the graph to form an order for elimination, and the choice is arbitrary. This strategy is essential to maintain low complexity \(polynomial practical. Nevertheless, a warned reader may conclude that this arbitrary choice implies that there are many compactions to produce and therefore the approach as a whole does not show to produce an optimal solution. And the reader is right in this conclusion. Since the goal is compaction, the search for an optimal solution can be bypassed provided a substantial level of pruning is achieved To complete the whole view, we describe how web service descriptions are complemented with the association rules as recommendations. In effect, under our scheme, the document describing the web service is augmented with a set of OWL/RDF/S triples that only incorporate the non-pruned rules with the format of Example 1, that is, the set ARmin of the compaction program obtained by our algorithm, together with the thresholds applied to the mining process and a registered URI of a registered description service. The assumptions and defeaters are not added to the web service description. If the associations encoded in the triples are not sufficient for the client \(a search engine, for instance widening of the response to the description service identified by the given URI, and then the assumptions and defeaters are produced. The reasoning task required for deriving all the implicitly published rules is client responsibility Notice that, under this scheme, the actual rules that appear as members of the set initial ARmin set are irrelevant; the only important issue is the size of the set The developed scheme also supports an extension of the algorithm that admits the assignment of priorities to rules and to itemsets, in order to allow the user to produce a more controlled program as output. Nonetheless, the importance of the extension has not been already tested, and therefore it is beyond the subject of the present paper It would be also interesting to design a scheme that supports queries where the client provides an itemset class and values for support and confidence and the engine produces a maximal class of inferred associated itemsets as a response. This scheme is also under development, so we have not discussed this aspect here 


VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have presented a defeasible logic framework for managing associations that helps in reducing the number of rules found in a set of discovered associations. We have presented an induction algorithm for inducing programs in our logic, made of assumption schemas, a reduced set of association rules and a set of counter-arguments to conclusions called defeaters, guaranteeing that every pruned rule can be effectively inferred from the output. Our approach outperform those of [17], because all reduction compactions presented there can be expressed and induced in our framework, and several other patterns, particular to the given datasets, can also be found. In addition, since a set of definite clauses can be obtained from the induced programs, the knowledge obtained can be modularly inserted in a richer inference engine Abduction can be also attempted, asking for justifications that explain the presence of certain association in the dataset The framework presented can be extended in several ways Admitting defeaters to appear in the head of assumption, to define user interest Admitting arithmetic expressions within assumptions for adjustment in pruning Admitting set formation patterns as itemset constants Extending the scope, to cover temporal association rules REFERENCES 1]  R.
